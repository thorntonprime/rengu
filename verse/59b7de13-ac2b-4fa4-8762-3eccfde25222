Remember that it is not only desire of office and of wealth that makes men
abject and subservient to others, but also desire of peace and leisure and
travel and learning. Regard for any external thing, whatever it be, makes you
subservient to another. ... What, pray, is this peace of mind, which any one
can hinder -- I do not mean Caesar, or Caesarâ€™s friend, but a raven, a
flute-player, a fever, countless other things? Nothing is so characteristic of
peace of mind as that it is continuous and unhindered. ... There is but one
way to peace of mind (keep this thought by you at dawn and in the day-time and
at night) -- to give up what is beyond your control, to count nothing your
own, to surrender everything to heaven and fortune, to leave everything to be
managed by those to whom Zeus has given control, and to devote yourself to one
object only, that which is your own beyond all hindrance.
