O Maghavan, verily, this body is mortal. It has been appropriated by Death.
(But) it is the standing-ground of that deathless, unembodied Self (Âtman).
Verily, he who dwells in the body has been appropriated by pleasure and pain.
Verily, there is no freedom from pleasure and pain for one while he dwells in
the body. Verily, while one is unembodied, pleasure and pain do not touch
him.
