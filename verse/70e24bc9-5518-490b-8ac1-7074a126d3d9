There is a hidden manna altogether unknown to all but they who taste
it. For this sweetness is of the heart not of the flesh, so that no
carnal person can know it. 'Thou hast put gladness in my heartâ€™ (Psalm
iv. 7). Bodily delights even as the body itself may be discerned by
the bodily eye; the delights of the heart and this heart itself cannot
be seen by the eye of the flesh. Why should a man know spiritual
pleasure unless truly and without feigning he enters into his own
heart and abides there.
