Darkness, light, fire and air, water and earth, stand in their
temporary, created distinction and strife for no other end, with no
other view, but that they may obtain the one thing needful, their
first condition in Heaven; and shall man that is born into time for no
other end, on no other errand but that he may be an angel in eternity,
think it hard to live as if there were but one thing needful for him?
What are the poor politics, the earthly wisdom, the ease, sensuality,
and advancements of this world for us but such fruits as must be eaten
in hell? To be swelled with pride, to be fattened with sensuality, to
grow great through craft, and load ourselves with earthly goods is
only living the life of beasts, that we may die the death of devils.
On the other hand, to go starved out of this world, rich in nothing
but heavenly tempers and desires, is taking from time all that we came
for, and all that can go with us into eternity.
