Title: Your Scent I Know
Description: April 27
---
The ferry to any shore, to any land, to any realm, it is the wine cup, the
heart.

An unseen vessel it is though to most, love, but so capable of travel, via a
prayer or a soul’s deep wish.

And your spirit’s arms, they can reach out and really touch anything you want
to hold.

It should be that way, and it is. For you, dear, all within time, are right
before me. Your scent I know; your ways I shape.
