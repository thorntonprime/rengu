If there are mangoes on the top of a big tree you do not jump all at
once to pluck them.  It is impossible. You gradually climb up the tree
by catching hold of the different branches and so reach the top of the
tree. Even so you cannot jump all at once to the summit of the
spiritual ladder. You will have to place your feet with caution on
each rung.
