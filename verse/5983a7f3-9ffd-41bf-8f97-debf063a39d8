But why do the philosophers call their gold now ‘water’, and now
‘earth’? Do they not contradict themselves, or each other? No; our
Sages, in expounding the truth, veil it under obscure and allegorical
expressions, but nevertheless agree with each other so marvellously
that they all seem to speak, as it were, with one mouth. They do not
confound one thing with another, nor do they wish to lead the earnest
enquirer astray. They express themselves in mystic phrases to hide the
truth from the unworthy and impious, lest they should seem to be
casting pearls before swine, and giving the holy thing to be trodden
underfoot by these who think only of indulging their lustful desires
The Sages, then, do well to call their gold earth or water; for they
have a perfect right to term it whatever they like If any one does not
perceive their meaning at first glance, he must blame his own
ignorance, not their jealousy.
