  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=Virtue
By: Marsilio Ficino
---
What else is speculative virtue but the clarity of the intellect? What else is
moral virtue but the stable ardor of appetite kindled by the clarity of the
intellect? ... What is the end of virtue? The end of moral virtue is to
purify and to separate the Soul from the divisible body; that of speculative
virtue, to grasp the incorporeal and universal concepts of things, whose locus
is far from divisible bodies.
