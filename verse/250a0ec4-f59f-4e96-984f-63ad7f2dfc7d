How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy
thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor; thy belly is like
an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by
the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh
toward Damascus.

Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple;
the king is held in the galleries.

How fair and how pleasant art thou. O love, for delights! ...

I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.
