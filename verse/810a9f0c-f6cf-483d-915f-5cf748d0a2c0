Hear now from me of the far more dreadful Taptakumbha. It has all
around it heated pans, encircled by flames of fire, filled with iron
dust and boiling oil resembling flames. In these vessels are thrown by
the envoys of Yama perpetrators of wicked deeds with their faces bent
towards the ground; they are fried there with their bodies bursting
and rendered foul with fatty excretions. With their heads, eyes and
bones coming out, they are forcibly taken up by ferocious vultures and
are again thrown into them. Then accompanied by hissing sounds and
converted into liquid, their heads, bodies, tendons, flesh, skin and
bones are mixed with oil. Then the perpetrators of iniquities are
pounded in these volumes of eddying oil with a ladle by the emissaries
of Yama. Thus I have described to you at length, O father, the hell
Taptakumbha.
