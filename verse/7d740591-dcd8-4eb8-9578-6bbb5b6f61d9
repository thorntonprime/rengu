Title: Coax Your Mind
Description: April 28
---
Who can look each day at a beautiful landscape in the distance and not at some
  point want to explore it?

Who can look out at the ocean every morning and never venture beyond your
  common horizon

when a boat I am offering to you, and even willing to do most of the paddling?

It is good if something gnaws at your innards until you come to real terms with
  your potential.

God, like a flea, may bite you somewhere to get your focus to shift.

The Holy, like a good poem, may enter you and coax your mind ... to wade out to
  more interesting internal space.
