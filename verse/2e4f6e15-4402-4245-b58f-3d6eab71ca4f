Title: All Shape Would Collapse
Description: May 8
---
How many times a paw touched the earth today I know. I watched and counted them
  and almost lost my mind in ecstasy.

The body of everything I became, and now AM, when God and I smooched so deeply
  one night. What did you think might happen then? What is union all about ...
  with the Omnipresent?

Anything’s hunt for food I know, I share. Your breathing draws me in and out.
  All beings’ joys and fears I share.

Something we call God I move with. The holy spirit is my twin.

Without me all shape would collapse. It is true I hold you up. Existence’s cane
  is my love.

If I were summoned to a court and accused of being deluded,

I could supply all the evidence needed to show ... all I say is not false.
