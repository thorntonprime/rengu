By: John Smith the Platonist

All the light and knowledge that may seem sometimes to rise up in
unhallowed minds, is but like those fuliginous flames that arise up
from our culinary fire, that are soon quenched in their own smoke; or
like those foolish fires that fetch their birth from terrene
exudations, that do but hop up and down, and flit to and fro upon the
surface of this earth where they were first brought forth; and serve
not so much to enlighten, as to delude us; nor to direct the wandering
traveller into his way, but to lead him farther out of it. While we
lodge any filthy vice in us, this will be perpetually twisting itself
into the thread of our finest spun speculations; it will be
continually climbing up into the rdí/ycpovtxdv, the hegemonical powers
of the soul, into the bed of reason, and defile it： like the wanton
ivy twisting itself about the oak, it will twine about our judgments
and understandings, till it hath sucked out the life and spirit of
them.
