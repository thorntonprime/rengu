Be aloof.
Do not engage yourself to any idea you get.
Free yourself from everything chance brings you,
  things that accumulate and cumber you.
Set your mind in virtue to contemplation,
  in which the God you bear in your heart
  shall be your steady object,
the object from which your attention never wavers.

Whatever else your duty may be --
  fasting, watching, or praying --
dedicate it all to this one end,
doing each only as much as is necessary to your single end.

This is the way of perfection.

Who could endure long in this unwavering contemplation of God?
No one living.
I tell you this only so that you may desire and aspire to it.
If this vision is withdrawn from you,
it will be as if an eternity of bliss was taken.
You must return at once to the pursuit so it may return.

Set a perpetual watch over yourself and your thoughts
and let your refuge be this aspiration,
and abide there constantly.
