King. By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

Berowne. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
O! who can give an oath? where is a book?
  That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack.
If that she learn not of her eye to lookï¼š
  No face is fair that is not full so black
