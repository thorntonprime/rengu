Title: Dissolving in the Infinite
Description: January 27
---
I have opened all the windows in my house. Eagles fly in and out, as
do any words that are spoken about me.

Anything my ears might detect, firsthand or second ... I might give
that news a moment’s attention

and then just let it be the tiny evaporating whiff of smoke it is,
dissolving in the Infinite.
