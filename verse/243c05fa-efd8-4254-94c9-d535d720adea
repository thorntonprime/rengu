Kungtutse asked Mencius, 'We are all human beings. Why is it that some are
great men and some are small men?' Mencius replied, "Those who attend to
their greater selves become great men. and those who attend to their smaller
selves become small men.' ’But we are all human beings. Why is it that some
people attend to their greater selves and some attend to their smaller
selves?' Mencius replied, 'When our senses of sight and hearing are
distracted by the thing outside, without the participation of thought, then
the material things act upon the material senses and lead them astray. That
is the explanation. The function of the mind is thinking： when you think,
you keep your mind, and when you don't think, you lose your mind. This is
what heaven has given to us. One who cultivates his higher self will find
that his lower self follows in accord. That is how a man becomes a great
man.'
