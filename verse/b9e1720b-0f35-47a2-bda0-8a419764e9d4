Just as an unshapen stone can be fashioned into a beautiful image worthy of
adoration and worship only after it has received many a stroke of the chisel,
so also a distorted and inharmonious life has to pass through many a trial,
suffering and tribulation, before a great change could come over it, before
the life of ignorance could be transmuted into a life of immortal splendour
and joy, fit to be revered and adored.
