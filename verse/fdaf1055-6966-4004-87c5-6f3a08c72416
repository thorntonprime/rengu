Such a householder may be compared to a waterfowl. It is constantly diving
under water： yet. by fluttering its wings only once, it shakes off all traces
of wet. ...

One can live in the world after acquiring love of God. It is like breaking
the jack-fruit after rubbing your hands with oil： the sticky juice of the
fruit will not smear them.
