Abandoning without reserve all the desires bom of mental fancies, and
restraining completely by the mind the entire group of the senses from all
directions,

With understanding held by firmness, and mind established in the Self, let him
(the Yogi) (thus) by degrees attain tranquility; let him not think of anything
else.

Wheresoever the restless and unsteady mind may wander away, let him withdraw
it from there and bring it under the control of the Self alone.

He whose passions are quieted and mind perfectly tranquil, who has become one
with Brahman, being freed from all impurities, to such a Yogi comes supreme
bliss.
