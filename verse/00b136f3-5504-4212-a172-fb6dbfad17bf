As to them that are ungodly of works, shrieking in anguish, they are
flayed of their whole skin by the Death-god’s henchmen, their bodies
bathed with copper molten in the fire, their flesh cut off in gobbets
by hundreds of blows from flaming swords and pikes, and they fall
again and again upon beds of red-hot iron.
