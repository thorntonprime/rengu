Title: Wanting Our Life to Make Sense
Description: February 4
---
All day long you do this, and then even in your sleep ... pan for gold.

We are looking to find something to celebrate with great enthusiasm,

wanting all our battles and toil and our life to make sense.

“I found it, I found it, I found it!” a hermit once began to shout,
after having spent years in solitude, meditating.

“Where?” a young shepherd boy nearby asked. “Where?”

And the hermit replied, “It may take a while, but I will show you. For
now, just sit near to me.”

All day long we do this with our movements and our thoughts ... pan for
gold.
