\‘Remember, Consolata, that I am good. Do not disfigure me! the world likes
to think of sanctity under a mask of austerity, discipline and chains.—No,
this is false!  If sacrifice and penance are encountered in the life of a
saint, these do not constitute his whole life. The saint, the soul who gives
himself generously to me, is the happiest being in the world, for I am good,
exclusively good.

‘Do not forget that the Jesus whom thou sawest die on a cross at the end of
his mortal career is the same person who shared the common life with all men
for thirty years; the same who during his three years of preaching took part
in banquets Do not disfigure me and do not ever forget that I am good.’
