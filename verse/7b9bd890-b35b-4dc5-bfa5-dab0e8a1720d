The Being of all beings is but one only Being, but in its generation it
separates itself into two principles, viz. into light and darkness, into
joy and sorrow, into evil and good, into love and anger, into fire and light,
and out of these two eternal beginnings (or principles) into the third
beginning, viz. into the creation, to its own love-play and melody, according
to the property of both eternal desires.
