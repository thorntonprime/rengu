If only one would eliminate
  all conceptual thought in a flash
that source-substance would manifest itself
  like the sun
ascending through the void
  and illuminating the whole universe
  without hinderance or bounds.

Above, below, and around
all is spontaneously existing
for there is nowhere which is outside
  the Buddha-Mind.
