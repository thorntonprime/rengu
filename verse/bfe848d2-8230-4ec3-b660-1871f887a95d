The reason why the life of man was, as tradition says, spontaneous, is as
followsï¼š In those days God himself was their shepherd, and ruled over them,
just as man, who is by comparison a divine being, still rules over the lower
animals. Under him there were no forms of government or separate possession
of women and children; for all men rose again from the earth, having no
memory of the past. And although they had nothing of this sort, the earth
gave them fruits in abundance, which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden, and
were not planted by the hand of man. And they dwelt naked, and mostly in the
open air, for the temperature of their seasons was mild; and they had no
beds, but lay on soft couches of grass, which grew plentifully out of the
earth. Such was the life of man in the days of Cronos.
