A reproach is sometimes levelled at our Art, as though it claimed the power
of creating gold; every attentive reader ... will know that it only
arrogates to itself the power of developing, through the removal of all
defects and superfluities, the golden nature, which the baser metals possess
in common with that highly-digested metallic substance I have shewn that
the transmutation of metals is not a chimerical dream, but a sober
possibility of Nature, who is perfectly capable of accomplishing it without
the aid of magic; and that this possibility of metallic transmutation is
founded upon the fact that all metals derive their origin from the same
source as gold, and have only been hindered from attaining the same degree
of maturity by certain impurities, which our Magistery is able to remove.
