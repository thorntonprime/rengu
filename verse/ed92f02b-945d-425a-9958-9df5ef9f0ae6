As God's kingdom is set up, so the devil’s kingdom may be pulled down,
without the noise of axes and hammers. We may then attain to the
greatest achievements against the gates of hell and death, when we
most of all possess our souls in patience, and collect our minds into
the most peaceful, composed, and united temper. The motions of true
practical religion are most like that of the heavens, which though
most swift, is yet most silent. . . .  This fight and contest with sin
and Satan is not to be known by the rattling of the chariots, or the
sound of an alarm： it is indeed alone transacted upon the inner stage
of men’s souls and spirits： and is rather a pacifying and quieting of
all those riots and tumults raised there by sin and Satan： ... it is
a captivating and subjecting all our powers and faculties to God and
true goodness.
