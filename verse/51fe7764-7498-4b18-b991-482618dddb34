A good man is no more solicitous whether this or that good thing be
mine, or whether my perfections exceed the measure of this or that
particular creature; for whatsoever good he beholds any where, he
enjoys and delights in it as much as if it were his own, and whatever
he beholds in himself, he looks not upon it as his property but as a
common good; for all these beams come from one and the same fountain
and ocean of light, in whom he loves them all with a universal love.
