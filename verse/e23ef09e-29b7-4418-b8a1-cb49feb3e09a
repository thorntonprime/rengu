The master said, ‘Everything that exists is God.’ The pupil understood
it literally, but not in the right spirit. While he was passing
through the street he met an elephant. The driver shouted aloud from
his high place, ‘Move away! Move away!’ The pupil argued in his mind,
‘Why should I move away? I am God, so is the elephant God; what fear
has God of himself?’ Thinking thus, he did not move. At last the
elephant took him up in his trunk and dashed him aside. He was hurt
severely, and going back to his master, he related the whole
adventure. The master said： ‘All right. You are God, the elephant is
God also, but God in the shape of the elephant-driver was warning you
from above. Why did you not pay heed to his warnings?’
