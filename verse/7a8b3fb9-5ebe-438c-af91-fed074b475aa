Title: At the Nile's End
Description: March 8
---
We are at the Nileâ€™s end, we are carrying particles from every
continent, creature, and age.

It has been raining on the plains of our vision for millions of years,

so our senses are a bit muddy compared to yours, dear God.

But I only hear these words from You where we are all now trying to
embrace the clear sky ocean,

Dear ones, come. Please, my dear ones come.
