Holy words do not abide in blind hearts, but go to the Light whence they came,

While the spell of the Devil goes into crooked hearts as a crooked shoe on to a
crooked foot.

Though you may learn Wisdom by rote, it becomes quit of you when you are
unworthy;

And though you write it and note it, and though you brag and expound it,

It withdraws its face from you, O disputatious one： it snaps its bonds and
takes flight from you.
