Title: Bu'l-Hasan and the Snow
Description: January 15
---
After Bestami died, it happened as he said
that Bu'l-Hasan became the sheikh for his community.

Every day Bu'l-Hasan would go to Bestami's tomb
to receive instruction. He had been told to do this
in a dream by Bestami himself.

Every dawn he goes and stands
facing the tomb until midmorning.

Either the spirit of Bestami comes and talks to him
or in silence the questions he has are answered.

One day a deep snow has fallen overnight.
The graves are indistinguishable.
Bu'l-Hasan feels lost.

Then he hears his sheikh's voice.
The world is made of snow.
It falls and melts and falls again.

Do not be concerned with the snow.
Come toward the sound of my voice.
Move always in this direction.

From that day Bu'l-Hasan began to experience
the enlightened state
he had only heard and read about before.
