Dhu ’l-Nûn the Egyptian says： ‘Ordinary men repent of their sins, but
the elect repent of their heedlessness,’ because ordinary men shall be
questioned concerning their outward behaviour, but the elect shall be
questioned concerning the real nature of their conduct.  Heedlessness,
which to ordinary men is a pleasure, is a veil to the elect.
