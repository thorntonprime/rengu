The Pagans ascribed to God the names of various perfections found in
creatures; e.g. we have the Temples of Peace, Eternity, Concord and
the Pantheon; and in the middle of the Pantheon in the open air an
altar was erected to the Infinite Term which is without term.  All
these names express what the one ineffable Name implies; and since the
proper Name is Infinite it includes all the numberless names that
denote particular perfections.  Numerous as such names may be they are
never so many or so great that they could not be added to, for each of
them is to the proper and ineffable Name what the finite is to the
Infinite. ...

The simple folk were led into error by this ... for instead of
regarding those sensible expressions as an image they took them for
the truth itself. The result of this was that the masses became
idolaters, whereas philosophers, for the most part, continued to have
a correct idea of the unity of God, as can be attested to by anyone
who has carefully read the ancient philosophers and Ciceroâ€™s De Deorum
Natura.
