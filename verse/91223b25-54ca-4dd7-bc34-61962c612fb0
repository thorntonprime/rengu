Ah, the nightingale!
There were many people there
But not one of them heard it.
  - Ryokan

The Yagyu were the masters of arms of the Tokugawa shoguns for several
generations.

One gorgeous afternoon in springtime, when he was practicing with the
sword, Yagyu Tajima no Kami said to one of his sons：

“One thing is sure： you’re not good for anything today. Are you
distracted or what?”

“No, Father. Just the opposite. I’m all concentration. My mind is
completely concentrated on my sword. I am not letting any extraneous
thoughts distract me.”

“While we were sparring, did you hear the song of the nightingale?”

“No.”

“That’s just what I thought. You still haven’t understood what real
concentration is.”

“What are you talking about!?”

“If the mind is aimed in just one direction, it becomes its own
obstacle and is unable to respond to all situations. That is what was
so well expressed in the poem of our great Zen master, Takuan Soho：

If you look at one leaf
You only see that.
If you don’t look at any of them
The whole tree appears.
