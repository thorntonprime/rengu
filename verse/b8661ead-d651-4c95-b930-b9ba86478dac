Description: Gujarati Hymn
Format: verse
---
The pathway of love is the ordeal of fire. The shrinkers turn away from it.
Those who take the plunge into the fire attain eternal bliss.
Those who stand afar off, looking on, are scorched by the flames.
Love is a priceless thing, only to be won at the cost of death.
Those who live to die, these attain; for they have shed all thoughts of self.
