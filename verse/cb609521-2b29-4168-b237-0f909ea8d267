On no account let anyone suppose that he is far from God because of his
infirmities or faults or for any other reason. If at any time thy great
shortcomings make an outcast of thee and thou canst not take thyself as
being nigh to God, take it then at any rate that he is nigh to thee, for
it is most mischievous to set God at a distance. Man goes far away or near
but God never goes far off; he is always standing close at hand, and even if
he cannot stay within he goes no further than the door.
