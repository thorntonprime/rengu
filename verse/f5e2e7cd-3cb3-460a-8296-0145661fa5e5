Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim’s thirst and tendance of the
Inviolable Place of Worship as (equal to the worth of) him who
believeth in Allâh and the Last Day, and striveth in the way of Allâh?
They are not equal in the sight of Allâh. Allâh guideth not wrongdoing
folk.

Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their
wealth and their lives in Allâh’s way are of much greater worth in
Allâh’s sight. These are they who are triumphant.
