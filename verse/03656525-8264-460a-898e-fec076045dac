Verily, this (brick-)built Fire-altar (Agni) is this (terrestrial)
world:—the waters (of the encircling ocean) are its (circle of)
enclosing-stones; the men its Yagushmatis (bricks with special
formulas); the cattle its Sûdadohas (nourishment); the plants and
trees its earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), its oblations
and fire-logs; Agni (the terrestrial fire) its Lokamprmâ (space
filling brick) -- thus this comes to make up the whole Agni. and the
whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows
this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.

But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the air ... is the sky ... is the
sun ... is the Metres . ..  is the Year ... is the body (etc.).
