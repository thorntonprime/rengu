Title: Last Night, As I Was Sleeping
---
Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- marvellous error! --
that a spring was breaking
out in my heart.
It saidï¼š Along which secret acqueduct,
Oh water, are you coming to me,
water of a new life
that I have never drunk?

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- marvellous error! --
that I had a beehive
here inside my heart.
And the golden beeds
were making white combs
and weet honey
from my old failures.

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- marvellous error! --
that a fiery sun was giving
light inside my heart.
It was fiery because I felt
warmth as from a hearth,
and sun because it gave light
and brought tears to my eyes.

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- marvellous error! --
that it was God I had
here inside my heart.
