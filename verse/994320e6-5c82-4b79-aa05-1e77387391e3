All the Creatures stood together in Man, as in the Head, in a Divine Harmony
of their Essences and Operations, of each with itself, of each with other,
of all with God. From Man as the Head, this Harmony was propagated and
maintain’d thro’ the Creatures, subsisting apart by themselves. One Divine
Life, mov’d, shin’d, sounded in and thro’ all, as an unexpressible Love,
Beauty, Musick, made up out of all, compleat in all, beginning and terminating
in Man, as the Head of all.
