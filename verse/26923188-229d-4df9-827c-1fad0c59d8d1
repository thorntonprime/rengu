Title: Ingredients from All Thought
Description: May 6
---
There is still a part of you that moves on all fours, wheels now instead of
  hooves.

One wheel from the East, one wheel from the West, a representative of the
  North, a delegate from the South -- do you know them? They are now a part of
  your every hour.

I know I am being cryptic. Now I will be more plain.

Ingredients from all thought and realms, and time -- past, present and future
  -- are in you. A few words from each of the great prophets brought to mind
  every day would help all you planted reach its potential, and will help
  distill your extraordinary worth.

Reveal yourself to us so that the cries of darkness no longer disturb any you
  love. Become that, which the unlit wick goes to for light.

Heaven guards our souls because they are so precious. A brightness we can give
  even God needs. If this was not true why would He ever bow to us? And that He
  has, I know. I have seen His profound humility.

Service to others will help you become deaf to a voice inside of you that does
  not believe in happiness.  And while you are at it, remembering things ...
  find four poets you like and imbibe their words into your repertoire.

Then, if you are ever in a jam, there are pawn shops I know about, where you
  could cash them in.
