By: Sri Ramakrishna
Commentary: One is reminded here of the practices employed in Zen Buddhism.
---
A disciple asked his teacher, ‘Sir, please tell me how I can see God.’ ‘Come
with me.’ said the guru, ‘and I shall show you.’ He took the disciple to a
lake, and both of them got into the water. Suddenly the teacher pressed the
disciple’s head under the water. After a few moments he released him and the
disciple raised his head and stood up. The guru asked him. ‘How did you feel?’
The disciple said, ‘Oh! I thought I should die; I was panting for breath.’ The
teacher said. ‘When you feel like that for God, then you will know you haven’t
long to wait for His vision.’
