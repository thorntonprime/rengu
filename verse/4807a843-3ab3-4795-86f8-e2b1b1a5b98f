All feelings that gather you up and lift you are pure. If they twist and tear
at your being, they are not. All tenderness you may feel for your childhood is
good. Every emotion that makes more of you than you have ever been, even in
your best hours, is good. Every intensification is good, if it seizes you
entire and is not an intoxication or delusion, but a joy you can see into,
clear to the bottom. Do you understand what I mean?
