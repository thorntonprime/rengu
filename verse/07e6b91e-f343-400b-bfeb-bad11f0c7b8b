The supreme mystery in the Veda’s End (Vedânta),
Which has been declared in former time,
Should not be given to one not tranquil,
Nor again to one who is not a son or a pupil.
To one who has the highest devotion (bhakti) for God,
And for his spiritual teacher (guru) even as for God.
To him these matters which have been declared
Become manifest (if he be) a great soul (mahâtman)—
Yea, become manifest (if he be) a great soul!
