Harmony, which has motions akin to the revolutions of our souls, is not
regarded by the intelligent votary of the Muses as given by them with a view to
irrational pleasure, which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day, but as
meant to correct any discord which may have arisen in the courses of the soul,
and to be our ally in bringing her into harmony and agreement with herself; and
rhythm too was given by them for the same reason, on account of the irregular
and graceless ways which prevail among mankind generally, and to help us
against them.
