The Scholars represent ritual-and-righteousness, the farmers and
fighting men food and drink. To ennoble the farmers and fighting men
and bring the Scholars to ruin is equivalent to (society) abandoning
ritual-and-righteousness and devoting itself to food and drink; and if
ritual-and-righteousness were gone, the foundations of society would
be destroyed and the upper and lower ranks be in confusion, whilst the
Yin and Yang would get out of gear, the wetness and dryness of the
seasons be out of order, the five cereals not be raising their heads,
the myriad populace dying of starvation, with the farmers having no
means of tilling the soil and the soldiers no means of fighting.

When Tzu Kung wished to abolish the sacrifice of a sheep at the
announcement of the new moon, Confucius said, ‘You love the sheep in
this matter： I love the rite.’ Tzu Kung hated the waste of a sheep,
whilst Confucius was concerned about the abandonment of ritual. The
fact is that if an old dyke is taken to be of no use and is let go,
there is sure to be a disastrous flood; and if old rites are taken to
be of no service and are let go, there is sure to be disastrous
anarchy. The existence of the Scholars down the generations amounts to
the old dykes of ritual-and-righteousness. To have them is of no
(apparent) utility： not to have them is definitely harmful.
