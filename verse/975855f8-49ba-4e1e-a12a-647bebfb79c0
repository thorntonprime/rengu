Title: Remember a Song You Know
Description: June 16
---
If you are sad, remember a beautiful song you know. It is really something
  living.

It can bring you to the place where it was created out of light, and you can
  feel that for a moment.

If you do not wish to sing, if you are feeling shy or just too low, picture me
  doing so, while

sitting at a table with you, with maybe a drink in our hands ... toasting

something you would like to clink a cup with me about, my dear.
