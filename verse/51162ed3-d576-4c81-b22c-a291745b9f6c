Long ago the Egyptians appear to have recognized the very principle of which we
are now speaking -- that their young citizens must be habituated to forms and
strains of virtue.  These they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them in
their temples; and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to
leave the traditional forms and invent new ones. To this day, no alteration is
allowed either in these arts, or in music at all. And you will find that their
works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms which they had ten
thousand years ago. ... A lawgiver may institute melodies which have a natural
truth and correctness without any fear of failure. To do this, however, must be
the work of God.  or of a divine person; in Egypt they have a tradition that
their ancient chants which have been preserved for so many ages are the
composition of the Goddess Isis. ... The love of novelty which arises out of
pleasure in the new and weariness of the old, has not strength enough to
corrupt the consecrated song and dance, under the plea that they have become
antiquated.
