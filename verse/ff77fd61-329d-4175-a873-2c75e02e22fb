The first Light which shined in my Infancy in its primitive and innocent
clarity was totally eclipsed： insomuch that I was fain to learn all again.
If you ask me how it was eclipsed? Truly by the customs and manners of men,
which like contrary winds blew it out： by an innumerable company of other
objects, rude, vulgar, and worthless things, that like so many loads of
earth and dung did overwhelm and bury it： by the impetuous torrent of wrong
desires in all others whom I saw or knew that carried me away and alienated me
from it： by a whole sea of other matters and concernments that covered and
drowned it： finally by the evil influence of a bad education that did not
foster and cherish it. All men’s thoughts and words were about other matters.
They all prized new things which I did not dream of. I was a stranger and
unacquainted with them; I was little and reverenced their authority; I was
weak, and easily guided by their example： ambitious also, and desirous to
approve myself unto them. And finding no one syllable in any man’s mouth of
those things, by degrees they vanished, my thoughts (as indeed what is more
fleeting than a thought?) were blotted out; and at last all the celestial,
great, and stable treasures to which I was born, as wholly forgotten, as if
they had never been.
