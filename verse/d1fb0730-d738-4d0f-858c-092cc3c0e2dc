Title: The Vigil
Description: May 8
---
Lovers cannot sleep
when they feel the privacy
of the beloved all around them.

Someone who is thirsty
may sleep for a little while,
but he or she will dream of water,
a full jar beside a creek,
or the spirit-water you get
from another person.

All night, listen to the conversation.
Stay up. This moment is all there is.
