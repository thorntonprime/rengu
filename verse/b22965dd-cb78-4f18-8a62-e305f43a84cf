  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=Music
By: Confucius

Tones rise from the human heart, and music is connected with the principles of
human conduct. Therefore the animals know sounds but do not know tones, and the
common people know tones but do not know music. Only the superior man is able
to understand music. Thus from a study of the sounds, one comes to understand
the tones; from a study of the tones, one comes to understand music; and from
the study of music, one comes to understand the principles of government and is
thus fully prepared for being a ruler.
