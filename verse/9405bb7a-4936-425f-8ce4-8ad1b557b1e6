Just the deep quiet,
just wanting that now,
the unmoving breeze to penetrate me.

 ...

And then You are here,
the One who sired every world,

flooding my every crevice, every pore
dissolving any wound of loneliness,

satisfying every desire ...
eternal and ephemeral,
eternal and ephemeral.

The divine both soothing,
making me present,
and tearing me apart,
the way true rapture does.

This is what I was really made for.
