Title: Charging God Rent
Description: December 4
---
I might have to start charging God rent unless He starts doing more
around the house,

other than remaining locked, for the most part, in a room in me, and
playing hard to get.

Seems He could at least wash a few dishes and pick up a broom once in
a while in view of ...

Look at who is paying all the bills around here. You’re damn right,
it’s me!
