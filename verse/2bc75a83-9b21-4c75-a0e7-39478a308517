The clearest sign of the love of God is excessive pallor, associated with
continuous meditation, and prolonged vigil accompanied by complete
self-surrender, obediently and with great haste ere dread death come upon him
(the lover); and the lover speaks of love according to the measure of the Light
bestowed upon him. Hence it is said, that the sign of the love of God is the
indwelling of God’s Favours in the hearts of those whom God has singled out for
His Love.
