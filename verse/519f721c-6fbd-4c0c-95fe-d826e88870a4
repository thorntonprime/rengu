Thus all particular and imperfect Beings carry us up to the perfect and
universal Being, abstracted from them all, set on his Throne high and lifted up
above them all, from which, as their proper Head, they flow, by and in which,
as in their proper Root, they subsist, being the beams of this glorious Sun,
and Rivers from this full Sea.
