Title: The Mercy We Long For
Format: Verse
---
Don't boast, you judges, that you no longer torture
or clamp an iron collar round the neck.
Though the mercy we long for
may rearrange your features

and the scaffold fall into disuse
like an outgrown toy,
no one is better off.
The god of true mercy would step differently

into the undefended heart.
He would enter with radiance
the way gods do, strong as the sea wind

for treasure-bearing ships, and claim us as lightly
as the child of an infinite union
absorbed in play.
