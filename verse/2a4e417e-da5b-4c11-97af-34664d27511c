Good heavens, how deeply I am often saddened at seeing the human race,
which God created perfect, in His own image, and appointed to be the
lords of the earth, depart so far away from me (Nature)! I allude more
particularly to you, O stolid philosophaster, who presume to style
yourself a practical chemist, a good philosopher, and yet are entirely
destitute of all knowledge of me, of the true Matter, and of the whole
Art which you profess! For, behold, you break vials, and consume
coals, only to soften your brain still more with the vapours. You also
digest alum, salt, orpiment, and atrament; you melt metals, build
small and large furnaces, and use many vesselsï¼š nevertheless, I am
sick of your folly, and you suffocate me with your sulphurous smoke.
