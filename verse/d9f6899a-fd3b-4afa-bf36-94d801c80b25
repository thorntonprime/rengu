Luminous plants grow in dark valleys,
fit to be a catalyst for entering the path.
Mountain dwellers pick the leaves,
and the exquisite flavor flows into cups.

In the quietude it settles false thoughts,
and the enlightened mind illuminates the platform of understanding.
Without expenditure of human energy and strength,
immediately the Dharma gate swings open.
