Title: Timely Rain
Format: verse
---
In the jungles of flaming ego,
May there be cool iceberg of
        bodhicitta.

On the racetrack of bureaucracy,
May there be the walk of the elephant.

May the sumptuous castle of arrogance
Be destroyed by vajra confidence.

In the garden of gentle sanity,
May you be bombarded by coconuts of
       wakefulness.
