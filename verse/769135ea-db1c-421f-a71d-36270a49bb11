Be helpless and dumbfounded,
unable to say yes or no.

Then a stretcher will come from grace
to gather us up.

We are too dull-eyed to see the beauty.
If we say Yes we can, we will be lying.

If we way No we don't see it,
that no will behead us
and shut tight our window into spirit.

So let us be not sure of anything,
beside ourselves and only that,
so miraculous beings come running to help.

Crazed, lying in a zero circle, mute,
we will be saying finally,
with tremendous eloquence, Lead us.

When we have totally surrendered to that beauty,
we will become a mighty kindness.
