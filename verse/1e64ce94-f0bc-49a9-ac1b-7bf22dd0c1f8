One of them (a monk who had died in a state of mortal sin) appeared to
the surviving (monk) and said that he was damned.

\‘Do you suffer much?’ asked the living man.

For reply, the dead man extended his hand and let fall a drop of sweat
on a copper candelabrum. The candelabrum melted in less than an
instant, like wax in a fiery furnace.  And such a dreadful stench
filled the air that the monks were obliged to abandon the monastery
for three days. The monk who received this apparition left the
monastery and entered the Franciscan Order. I have this fact from
another Franciscan, who was in the same monastery.
