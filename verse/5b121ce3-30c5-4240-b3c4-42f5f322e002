Two Zen teachers, Daigu and Gudo, were invited to visit a lord.
Upon arriving, Gudo said to the lordï¼š "You are wise by nature
and have an inborn ability to learn Zen."

"Nonsense," said Daigu. "Why do you flatter thi blockhead? He
may be a lord, but he doesn't know anything of Zen."

So, instead of building a temple for Gudo, the lord built it for
Daigu and studied Zen with him.
