  - Life-Love=Love=God's Love for Us
  - 42
By: William Law
---
The Son of God, by a love greater than that which created the world, became man
and gave His own blood and life into the fallen soul, that it might, through
His life in it, be raised, quickened, and born again into its first state of
inward peace and delight, glory and perfection, never to be lost any more. O
inestimable truths! precious mysteries of the love of God, enough to split the
hardest rock of the most obdurate heart that is but able to receive one glimpse
of them! Can the world resist such love as this? Or can any man doubt whether
he should open all that is within him to receive such a salvation?

O unhappy unbelievers, this mystery of love compels me in love to call upon
you, to beseech and entreat you to look upon the Christian redemption in this
amiable light! All the ideas that your own minds can form of love and goodness
must sink into nothing as soon as compared with Godâ€™s love and goodness in the
redemption of mankind.
