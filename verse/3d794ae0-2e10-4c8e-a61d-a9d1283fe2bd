One day a voice said： ‘O Bâyazîd! Our Treasury is surfeited with acts
of worship and devotion. If thou desirest to possess Us, bring Us
something which is not found in our Treasury.’ ‘But my God! What can I
bring you?’ And the voice replied： ‘Bring us distress, humility,
supplication, and heartbreak.’
