  - Life-Love=Charity=Love of the Neighbour
By: Ananda Moyi
Commentary: >
  It can be seen that charity by this analogy must include chastisement of
  malefactors whether individual or collective, they being the corruption and
  disease of the body social.

The different organs of the human body fulfill different functions, some more
noble certainly than others, but for the good of the body they must all be
cared for. In the same way, try to treat with equal love all the people with
whom you have relations. Make a habit of this, and soon you will perceive that
all humankind is as your family. Thus the abyss between ‘myself’ and ‘yourself’
will be filled in, which is the goal of all religious worship.
