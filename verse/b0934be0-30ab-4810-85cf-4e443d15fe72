Think often of death with attention, bringing to mind everything which
must then happen. If you do this, that hour will not catch you
unawares. ... Men of this world flee from the thought and memory of
death, so as not to interrupt the pleasures and enjoyments of their
senses, which are incompatible with memory of death. This makes their
attachment to the blessings of the world continually grow and
strengthen more and more, since they meet nothing opposed to it. But
when the time comes to part with life and all the pleasures and things
they love, they are cast into excessive turmoil, terror and torment.
