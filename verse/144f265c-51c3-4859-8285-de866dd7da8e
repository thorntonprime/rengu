Title: Morning Water and a Poet
Description: March 17
---
We learn this from a drunken king,
who wakes up hungover and sick,
asking for two things, a morning drink of water,
and Let it be brought by a poet.

There is a tradition that the wine
of nonexistence makes us God-drunk.
Intoxicated that way, we are purified.

There is a kind of poet
whose poetry pours that wine,

and there is another poet who makes us want
the red wine and the white.
The two poets may even have the same name.

Look inside form. Read with your soul
this Masnavi. Let it bring you
morning water and a poet.
