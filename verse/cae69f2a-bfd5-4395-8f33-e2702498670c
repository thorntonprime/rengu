Moses entered into the darkness where God was, that is into the unseen,
invisible, incorporeal and archetypal essence of existing things. Thus he
beheld what is hidden from the sight of the mortal nature, and, in himself and
his life displayed for all to see, he has set before us, like some
well-wrought picture, a piece of work beautiful and godlike, a model for those
who are willing to copy it. Happy are they who imprint that image in their
souls.
