It has indeed lately come to Our ears, not without afflicting Us with
bitter sorrow, that in some parts of Northern Germany, as well as in
the provinces, townships, territories, districts, and dioceses of
Mainz, Cologne, Treves, Salzburg, and Bremen, many persons of both
sexes, unmindful of their own salvation and straying from the Catholic
Faith, have abandoned themselves to devils, incubi and succubi, and by
their incantations, spells, conjurations, and other accursed charms
and crafts, enprmities and horrid offences, have slain infants yet in
the motherâ€™s womb, as also the offspring of cattle, have blasted the
produce of the earth, the grapes of the vine, the fruits of trees,
nay, men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as animals
of other kinds, vineyards, orchards, meadows, pasture-land, corn,
wheat, and all other cereals; these wretches furthermore afflict and
torment men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as
animals of other kinds, with terrible and piteous pains and sore
diseases, both internal and external; they hinder men from performing
the sexual act and women from conceiving, whence husbands cannot know
their wives nor wives receive their husbands; over and above this,
they blasphemously renounce that Faith which is theirs by the
Sacrament of Baptism, and at the instigation of the Enemy of Mankind
they do not shrink from committing and perpetrating the foulest
abominations and filthiest excesses to the deadly peril of their own
souls, whereby they outrage the Divine Majesty and are a cause of
scandal and danger to very many.
