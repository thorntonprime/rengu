The regenerate will, which goes out of its selfishness or self hood
again into the resignation; the same becomes also an enemy and an
abominate to self hood; as sickness is an enemy to health, and on the
contrary, health an enemy to sicknessï¼š Thus the resigned will, and
also the self-will are a continual enmity, and an incessant lasting
war and combat.
