God (al-haqq) wished to see the essences of His most perfect Names, which
number could never exhaust, --  or if thou preferest, thou canst equally sayï¼š
God wished to see His own essence -- in a global object, which being endowed
with existence, recapitulates the whole divine order, -- and in this way
to manifest His mystery to Himself.
