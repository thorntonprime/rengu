Many are attracted to philosophy whose natures are imperfect and whose souls
are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses. ... And when persons who are
unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is
a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated?
Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them
genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?
