There is only one thing to do. Go into yourself. Examine your reason for
writing. Discover whether it is rooted in the depths of your heart, and find
out whether you would rather die than be forbidden to write. Above all, ask
yourself in the stillest hour of the night, have I no choice but to write? Dig
deep within for the truest answer, and if this answer is a strong and simple
yes, then build your life upon this necessity. Your life henceforth, down to
its most ordinary and insignificant moment, must prove and reveal this truth.
