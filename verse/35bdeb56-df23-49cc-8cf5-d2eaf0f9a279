He is Allâh, than Whom there is no other God, the Knower of the Invisible and
the Visible. He is the Beneficent, the Merciful.

He is Allâh, than Whom there is no other God, the King, the Holy, Peace, the
Faithful, the Guardian, the All-Powerful, the Restorer, the Superb. Glorified
be Allâh from all that they associate with Him.

He is Allâh, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. His are the most Beautiful
Names.  All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Him, and He is the
Mighty, the Wise.
