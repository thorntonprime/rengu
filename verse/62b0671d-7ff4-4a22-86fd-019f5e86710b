Behold, thou art fair, my love;
behold, thou art fair;
thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks：
thy hair is as a flock of goats,
that appear from mount Gil'e-ad.

Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn,
which came up from the washing;
whereof every one bear twins,
and none is barren among them.

Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
and thy speech is comely：
thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory,
whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
all shields of mighty men.

Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins,
which feed among the lilies.

Until the day break,
and the shadows flee away,
I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
and to the hill of frankincense.

Thou art all fair, my love;
there is no spot in thee.
