  - Life-Love=Love=God's Love for Us
By: Eckhart
---
Now you must know. God loves the soul so mightily, he who should rob God of
loving the soul would rob him of his very life and being; would kill God, if
one may so say; for the very love wherewith God loves the soul is what his Holy
Breath is blowing in.
