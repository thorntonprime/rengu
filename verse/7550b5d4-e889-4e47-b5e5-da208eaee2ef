At Kâmârpukur I have seen the mongoose living in its hole up in the wall. It
feels snug there. Sometimes people tie a brick to its tail： then the pull of
the brick makes it come out of its hole. Every time the mongoose tries to be
comfortable inside the hole, it has to come out because of the pull of the
brick. Such is the effect of brooding on worldly objects that it makes the
yogi stray from the path of yoga.
