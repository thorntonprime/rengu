If by certain ones still living in this corruptible flesh, yet growing
in incalculable power by a certain piercingness of contemplation, the
Eternal Brightness of God is able to be seen, this is not at variance
with the words of Job： ‘Wisdom is hidden from the eyes of all the
living' (xxviii. 21); because he that sees Wisdom, which is God.
wholly dies to this life, that henceforth he should not be held by the
love thereof. He who sees God dies by the mere circumstance alone,
that either by the bent of the interior, or by the carrying out of
practice, he is separated with all his mind from the gratifications of
this life. Hence yet further it is said of Moses： ‘No man shall see me
and live' (Ex.  xxxiii.  20)： as though it were plainly expressed, ‘No
man ever at any time sees God spiritually and lives to the world
carnally’.
