Title: Parallel the Care the Dancer Takes
---
Parallel the care the dancer takes on her
finest step.

You need to feel the craving for that
unison, you need to know all the
longing the great ones had to suffer

before God said to them, "Here I am,
yours to do with whatever you like."

And when will the Beloved say such
a sublime thing to you, give you all that
power?

A prerequisite isï¼š when all you touch,
you touch as if it were sacred.

That will bring your mind to a standstill.
The space between you and any object

will then open up into a sea of radiance,
where you can drown for a second, drown,
and taste me.
