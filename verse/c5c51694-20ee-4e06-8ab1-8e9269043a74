Drop all relationships, set aside all activities. Do not think about
what is good or evil, and do not try to judge right from wrong. Do not
try to control perceptions or conscious awareness, nor attempt to
figure out your feelings, ideas, or viewpoints. Let go of the idea of
trying to become a buddha as well.
