We have heard truly that the way is strait that leads to life. This is
the way of penance that few find, the which therefore is called
strait; for by it, and it be right, the flesh is stripped from
unlawful solace of the world, and the soul is restrained from shrewd
pleasure and unclean thoughts, and is only dressed to the love of God.
But this is seldom found in men, for nearly none savour that which
belongs to Godï¼š but they seek earthly joy and in that they are
delighted, wherefore following their bodily appetite, and despising
their ghostly, they forsake all the ways that are healthful to their
soul, and they abhor them as strait, sharp, and unable to be borne by
their lust.
