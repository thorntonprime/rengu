  Cf. the vision Jeanne Le Royer, Sister of the Nativity (18th C.), has of
  the future cycle, when this present world has been totally consumed by
  fire： ‘Renewed in its nature and ornamented with all the luminaries, the
  firmament will show forth a sun and stars of a substance almost spiritual
  and of a cool brightness which will never be eclipsed. The Earth turned
  into a transparent globe will have all the brilliance of the most beautiful
  crystal, but without the hardness’ (Suzanne Jacquemin： Les Prophéties des
  Derniers Temps, Paris, 1958, p. 152)

At Meru the sun and the moon go round from left to right (Pradakshinam) every
day, and so do all the stars.

The mountain, by its lustre, so overcomes the darkness of night, that the night
can hardly be distinguished from the day.

The day and the night are together equal to a year to the residents of the
place.
