They (the disciples of Pythagoras who deviated) received the double of
the wealth which they brought, and a tomb was raised to them as if
they were dead by the homacov. for thus all the disciples of the man
were called. And if they happened to meet with them afterwards, they
behaved to them as if they were other persons, but said that they were
dead, whom they had modelled by education, in the expectation that
they would become truly good men by the disciplines they would learn.
