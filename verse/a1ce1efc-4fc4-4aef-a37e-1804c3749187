The time is near in which nothing will remain of Islam but its name,
and of the Qur'Ã n but its mere appearance, and the mosques of Muslims
will be destitute of knowledge and worship; and the learned men will
be the worst people under the heavens; and contention and strife will
issue from them, and it will return upon themselves.
