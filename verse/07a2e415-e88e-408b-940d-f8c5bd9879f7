Would you divinely know the mysteries of nature, the ground and reason of good
and evil in this world, the relation and connection between the visible and
invisible world, how the things of time proceed from, are influenced by, and
depend upon the things and powers of eternity, there is but one only key of
entrance; nothing can open the vision but seeing with the eyes of that same
love which begun and carries on all that is and works in visible and invisible
nature. Would you divinely know the mysteries of grace and salvation, would you
go forth as a faithful witness of Gospel truths, stay till this fire of divine
love has had its perfect work within you. For till your heart is an altar on
which this heavenly fire never goes out, you are dead in yourself and can only
be a speaker of dead words about things that never had any life within you. For
without a real birth of this divine love in the essence Of your soul, be as
learned and polite as you will, your heart is but the dark heart of fallen
Adam, and your knowledge of the kingdom of God will be only like that which
murdering Cain had.
