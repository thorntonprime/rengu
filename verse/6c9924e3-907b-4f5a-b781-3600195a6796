The LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD,
for the LORD is about to pass by.”

Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart
and shattered the rocks before the LORD,
but the LORD was not in the wind.
After the wind there was an earthquake,
but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
After the earthquake came a fire,
but the LORD was not in the fire.
And after the fire came a thin silence.

When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face
and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave.
