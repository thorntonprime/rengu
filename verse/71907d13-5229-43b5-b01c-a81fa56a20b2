Only the ignorant person disdains ritual practice (wird). Illumination
(wârid) is found in the Final Abode, while ritual practice is
discarded with the discarding of this abode; and the first thing to be
attended to is that whose existence cannot be replaced. Ritual
practice He asks of thee, while illumination thou askest of Him; and
what does He ask of thee compared with what thou askest of Him?
