The yogi masters the mental waves (vrittis) and reposes definitively
in the "samâdhi without qualifications' (asamprajnâta samâdhi). He
encounters grave difficulties on his way. for the waves of the ocean
are nothing compared with those of the mind. The true and dauntless
yogi is the pilot or the captain of the human ship which dances on the
terrible ocean of deaths and rebirths (samsâra). He puts an end to the
mental waves by a continual concentration (dhâranâ) and meditation,
thus attaining the other shore, where peace and immortality reign.
