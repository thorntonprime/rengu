Title: One of the Dumbest Things You Can Do
Description: June 18
---
One of the dumbest things you can do is backbite an animal, or a human being.

Reason isï¼š Besides the fact that an animal who is feeling grouchy that day
 might bite you back ...

whenever you speak ill of any living creature something of their shadow might
 fall on you.

Some unwanted impressions of theirs could spill on your floor,

and I imagine you are busy enough trying to keep things tidy
