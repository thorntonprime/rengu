But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers' soap：

And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver： and he shall purify
the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto
the Lord an offering in righteousness.
