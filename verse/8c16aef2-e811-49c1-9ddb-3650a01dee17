You also will have to cross the void. What appears to you as a chaos
when all the impulses of the mind have ceased is not really the
unmanifest (avyakta). This void must be traversed： it will try to
swallow you up. You are then alone, with nothing more to see or hear：
nothing to encourage you. You are thrown back on yourself. It is here,
at this critical juncture, that presence of spirit is required. Draw
strength and courage from it. The sage Uddâlaka himself experienced
enormous difficulties in crossing this void.
