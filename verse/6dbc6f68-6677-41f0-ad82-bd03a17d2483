Cut off and destroy in yourselves the roots of avarice, anger, ignorance,
pride. When you have cut off and destroyed the ‘life-death of the Six Worlds’
(as it is called) that will be the cessation of both life and death. When you
reach that stage your mind will come to an end and there will be real peace,
the calm of non-attachment to forms and shapes of the world. Then the moon
will be your pillow, so peacefully will you sleep. The sky will be your couch,
and you will command a view of the Lotus store-world of Amida and Vairocana.
Your body and soul will be pure. Everything will be pure. This is the first
entry into Nirvana.
