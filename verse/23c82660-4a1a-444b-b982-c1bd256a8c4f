There are people who give up this or that for love's sake,
but to him who sees the truth, it does not matter in the least.
And yet, living so, the whole world belongs to him.

Now is time, and here is place.
On this spot where I now stand,
if I got away from myself
and at the same time were completely pure,
God in heaven would beget in my spirit like a child
with such intensity that my spirit might in turn beget God.

There is a Being of the soul --
   yet not a Being, but something more than Being liberates
something so pure, sublime, and precious
that to creature can get to it save God,
for It is Itself the naked divinity of God.
