Now light comes to you, O Soul, from Mind ( voOs), and darkness from
the body; and if you understand this, you ought not to grieve that you
must quit the body. For it is through the body that you suffer the
greatest loss, and are prevented from apprehending those things which
it behoves you most to know. Nay, you ought rather to grieve that you
are separated from the thought-world; for it is by the action of that
world on you that you enjoy the greatest gains and are enabled to
attain to those things which it behoves you to seek after and to
grasp. Turn away then from the physical world, scorn and hate and fear
it, and seek refuge in the thought-world, which is the root and source
of your existence, and the abode appropriate to a being that stands so
high in rank and authority as you; that so you may partake of
everlasting life, and attain to perfect bliss.
