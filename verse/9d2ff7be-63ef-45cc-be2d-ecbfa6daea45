Initiation into the Divine Name or the solemn Mantra-Diksha is one of
the holiest and most significant of the sacred rituals in the
spiritual life. To receive the Guru-Mantra from a realised saint and
Sad-Guru is the rarest of good fortune and the most precious of the
divine blessings that may be bestowed upon the aspirant. ...

A most tremendous transformation begins to take place in the innermost
core of the conscience of the initiated or the receiver of the Mantra.
The initiated is himself unaware of this fact because of the veil of
ignorance or Mula-Ajnana that still covers him. ... But, nevertheless,
this transformation starts with initiation, and like unto a seed that
is sown in the earth, ultimately culminates in the grand fruit of
realisation or Atma-Jnana. ... The Sadhaka, after receiving
initiation, must make earnest and continuous effort in the form of
spiritual Sadhana if the Diksha is to become blissfully fruitful as
Self-realisation. This part is the Sadhakaâ€™s sole responsibility in
which task he will doubtless receive the help, guidance and grace of
the Guru in the measure of his firm faith and loyalty to him. ...

The process of initiation links you up directly with the Divine Being.
Initiation or Mantra-Diksha is at one end of this golden chain and the
Lord or the Highest Transcendental Atmic Experience is at the other
end of it.
