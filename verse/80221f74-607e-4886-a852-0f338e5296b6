Happy the man who is busy attending to what God is saying in him. He is
directly subject to the divine light-ray. The soul that stands with all her
powers under the light of God is fired and inflamed with divine love. The
divine light shines straight in from above, and a perpendicular sun on one's
head is a thing that few can survive. Yet the highest power of the soul, her
head, is held erect beneath this shaft of godly light so that there can shine
in this light divine which I have oft described as being so bright, so
overwhelming, so transcendent, that all lights are but darkness in comparison
with this light.
