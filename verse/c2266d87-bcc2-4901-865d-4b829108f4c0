    Title: Eigth Duino Elegy
Title: In Our Own Way
Description: March 5
Format: Verse
---
Ever turned toward what we create, we see in it
only reflections of the Open, darkened by us.
Except when an animal silently looks us through and through.
This is our fateï¼š to stand
in our own way. Forever
in the way.
