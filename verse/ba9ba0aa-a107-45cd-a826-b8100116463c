Property alone will confer rank, wealth will be the only source of
devotion, passion will be the sole bond of union between the sexes,
falsehood will be the only means of success in litigation, and women
will be the objects merely of sensual gratification. Earth will be
venerated only for its mineral treasures： ... dishonesty will be the
universal means of subsistence. ... menace and presumption will be the
subterfuge for learning, liberality will be devotion, simple ablution
will be purification, mutual assent will be marriage, fine clothes
will be dignity.
