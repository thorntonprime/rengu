What is the lesson of the Gitâ? It is what you get by repeating the word ten
times. As you repeat ‘Gitâ'. ‘Gîtâ’, the word becomes reversed into ‘tâgi’,
‘tâgi' -- which implies renunciation.  He alone has understood the secret of
the Gitâ who has renounced his attachment to ‘woman and gold’ and has
directed his entire love to God. It isn’t necessary to read the whole of the
Gitâ. The purpose of reading the book is served if one practises
renunciation.
