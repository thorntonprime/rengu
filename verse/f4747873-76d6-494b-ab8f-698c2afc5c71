To accomplish the inward act of God,
a person must withdraw all his soul's agents
into a corner of the soul,
and conceal himself from all ideas and forms.

It must be done by means of forgetting
and losing self-consciousness.
It is in the stillness, in the silence,
that the word of God is to be heart.
There is no better path
than through stillness, through silence.
It is to be heard there as it is --
in that unself-consciousness,
for when one is aware of nothing,
that word is imparted and revealed.

On must achieve unself-consciousness
by means of transformed knowledge.
This ignorance does not come from lack of knowledge,
but it  is from knowledge that one achieves this ignorance.
