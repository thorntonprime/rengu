  - Life-Love=Love=God's Love for Us
By: William Law
---
This is the amiable nature of God. He is the Good, the unchangeable,
overflowing fountain of good that sends forth nothing but good to all eternity.
He is the Love itself, the unmixed, unmeasurable Love, doing nothing but from
love, giving nothing but gifts of love to everything that He has made;
requiring nothing of all his creatures but the spirit and fruits of that Love
which brought them into being.
