Title: Lamp after Lamp
Description: June 12
---
You that prefer, as crows do,
winter's chill and the empty limbs,
notice now this that fills
with new leaves and roses opening
and the nightbird's song,

Let your love dissolve also
into this season's moment,
or when it's over you will buy
lamp after lamp to find it.
