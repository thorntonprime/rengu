Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then
take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?
God forbid.

What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?
for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but
he that committeth fornication sinneth against his Own body.

What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

For ye are bought with a price： therefore glorify God in your body,
and in your spirit, which are God’s.
