O eye, thou makest lament for others; sit down awhile and weep for
thyself!

The bough is made green and fresh by the weeping cloud, for the reason
that the candle is made brighter by weeping.

Wheresoever people are lamenting, sit you there, because you have a
better right to moan.

Inasmuch as they are concerned with parting from that which passes
away, and are forgetful of the ruby of everlastingness that belongs to
the mine of Reality.
