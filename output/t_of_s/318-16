Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder in the realm of Matter. We
are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as the creator and
governor of the realm of Matter. Not, of course, our individual minds, but
the Mind in which the atoms, out of which our individual minds have grown,
exist as Thought.
