In the democracy of the dead, all men are equal. The poor man is as rich as
the richest, and the rich man as poor as the pauper. The creditor loses his
usury, and the debtor is acquitted of his obligation. There, the proud man
surrenders his dignity; the politician his honors, the worldling his
pleasures; the invalid needs no physician; the laborer rests from toil. The
wrongs of time are redressed; injustice is expiated, and the irony of fate
is refuted.
