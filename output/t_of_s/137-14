It is not sufficient to deny or ignore evil; it must be understood. It is
not enough to pray to God to remove the evil; you must find out why it is
there, and what lesson it has for you. It is of no avail to fret and fume
and chafe at the chains that bind you; you must know how and why you are
bound.
