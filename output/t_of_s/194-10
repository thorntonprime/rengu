God’s Will You choose yourself to be a receiver of spiritual truth when you
surrender your will to God’s will. We all have the same potential. God is
revealed to all who seek—God speaks to all who will listen. When you
surrender your will to God’s will you enter a very busy life— and a very
beautiful one.
