When we leave this plane of experience, I think we graduate to the next
phase of our ongoingness of life itself. And we continue by stages. For
example, in the first grade we didn’t have to know everything perfectly,
but we had to know enough to get into the second grade, and so on from
there, building on what we learned. That’s my picture of what immortality
is all about.
