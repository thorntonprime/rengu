<4h 410 * Search/Look Within In the search for truth there are
certainquestions that are not important. Ofwhat material is the universe
con-structed? Is the universe eternal? Arethere limits or not to the
universe?What is the ideal form of organizationfor human society? If a man
were topostpone his search and practice forEnlightenment until such
questionswere solved, he would die before hefound the path.
