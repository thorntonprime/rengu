Everything belongs to the man who wants nothing. Having nothing, he
possesses all things in life, including life itself. Nothing will be denied
the man who denies himself. Having chosen to be utterly solitary he now
comes into possession of the most utterly social fact in the universe, the
kingdom of God.
