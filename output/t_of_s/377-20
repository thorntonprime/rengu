It is an immature concept to think of prayer for personal gain. It takes
from one the responsibility of the conditions of oneâ€™s life. Everything in
creation is based on universal laws. Cause and effect work perfectly in
accordance with this law. Yet mankind attempts to escape the hurt brought
on by his disobedience to higher law by praying to God to violate His own
laws.
