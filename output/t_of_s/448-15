The secret of the truly successful. ...is that they learned very well early
in life how not to be busy. They saw through the adage. ...that anything
worth doing is worth doing well. The truth is, many things are worth doing
only in the most slovenly, halfhearted fashion possible, and many things
are not worth doing at all.
