Life begins for anyone when thatindividual refuses to be a victim of
anydelimiting experience： disease, acci-dent, poverty, family pressure,
mar-riage dilemma, neglect. Whatever thecurse, if you will not take it, or
acceptthe role fate seems to offer, you cannever become a mental cripple
andnothing can hold you back.
