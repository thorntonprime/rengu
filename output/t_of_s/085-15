Death strikes without noticeï¼š the young and the old, the well and the
sickly, the high and the low, the rich and the poor. It is no respecter of
persons. There is no lasting peace as long as the person is still in the
body. Therefore, one should not place any trust in a life which is
sustained by so uncertain a thing as breathing in and out.
