An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but
its own existence. It is incapable of learning from the past, incapable of
understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right
conclusions about the future. It is hypnotized by itself and therefore
cannot be argued with. It inevitably dooms itself to calamities that must
strike it dead.
