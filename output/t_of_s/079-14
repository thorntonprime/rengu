Death does not end all. Death does notmean total annihilation. Death does
notend the chain or sequence. The work-ing agent, the Soul in the body,
doesnot and cannot die with the death ofthe body. Manâ€™s Soul is immortal.
Justas a person lays aside his overcoat, soalso he lays aside the physical
body atdeath.
