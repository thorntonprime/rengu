There is nothing more insidious than that solacing self-pity which would
rather bear a woe than induce the anguish which its removal requires. Worse
still, if an individual identifies himself as an underling, continually
stating, “I can’t win,” he diminishes his power to achieve, crippling
himself against all future endeavor.
