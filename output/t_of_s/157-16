When one was born one had no choice, nor does one have a choice when faced
with imminent “death.” In between birth and death, however, man considers
himself the master of his destiny. If only one gave some quiet thought to
the matter, one would surely find that almost every significant event in
one’s life has had an enormous element of “chance” or “coincidence” in it.
