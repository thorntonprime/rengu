Many religions claim that theirs is the only path to the Truth. ...But God
never made an agreement with any of these religions. All religions are of
fairly recent origin, but God has existed since the beginning of time. He
could not have signed a contract with any religious founder saying, “You
are my exclusive salesman.”
