Death, when we consider it closely, is the true goal of our existence. I
have formed during the last few years such close relations with this best
and truest friend of mankind, that this image is not only no longer
terrifying to me, but is indeed very soothing and consoling! And I thank my
God for graciously granting me the opportunity. ...of learning that death
is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.
