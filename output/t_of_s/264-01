♦? 264 ♦? Elusions •sp- This waking life is just a long dream which keeps
our attention away from what we really are. If you take the attitude that
all the happenings in the world are dream events, your mind becomes
tranquil. It is only when you take the dream world to be real that you get
agitated.
