Tremendous energy comes with anger. ...Do not suppress it： that would only
hurt you inside. Do not express it： this would not only hurt you inside, it
would cause ripples in your surroundings. What you do is transform it. You
somehow use that tremendous energy constructively on a task that needs to
be done, or in a beneficial form of exercise.
