The description that God is egoless may seem to be a poor one. It conveys
no sense to the ego-ridden mind. People want to be told that God dwells
somewhere in the sky, in a world of great splendor, surrounded by wonderful
beings. ...Even to understand that God dwells in their own hearts, men take
time.
