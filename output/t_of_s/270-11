Our own death is indeed unimaginable, and whenever we make the attempt to
imagine it we can perceive that we really survive as spectators. Hence.
...at the bottom no one believes in his own death, or to put the same thing
in another way, in the consciousness every one of us is convinced of his
own immortality.
