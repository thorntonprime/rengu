We seldom get rid of an evil merely by understanding its causes. ...and for
all our insight, obstinate habits do not disappear until replaced by other
habits. ...No amount of confession and no amount of explaining can make the
crooked plant grow straight; it must be trained upon the trellis by the
gardenerâ€™s art.
