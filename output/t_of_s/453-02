By: "Every man from king to peasant has a certain amount of sorrow. Even\
  \ in cases where it seems absent, it is only a time factor that makes\
  \ you think so\u2014 sooner or later it comes....One man may not question\
  \ sorrow or God at the first blow but he is likely to do so at the fifth\
  \ blow. We have taken this vehicle in order to know our real state...."
