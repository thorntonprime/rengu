Before we can change others, we must first change ourselves. This is a case
of where charity really does begin at home, and by beginning to cleanse
ourselves of those fears and dreads, uncertainties, wishful thinking, might
be’s and maybe’s, we come to a complete acceptance of spiritual
realization.
