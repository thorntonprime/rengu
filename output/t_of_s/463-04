One must realize that no physical or mental effort can take one to God. One
must give up, mentally and physically, all idea of reaching God and one
must finally throw oneself at God’s feet and let him do whatever He wishes
with you. When there is complete physical and mental self-surrender, then
God’s grace takes you to the goal.
