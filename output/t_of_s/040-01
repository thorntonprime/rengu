Effect isp? A harmonious action produces its harmonious counterpart. A
discordant action necessitates a reaction and will look ill-regulated but
will be, in reality, a balancing one. If you fight violence with violence,
you will perpetuate violence; but if you oppose it with strength of
meekness, you will enable meekness to triumph and violence will be broken.
