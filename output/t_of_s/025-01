Anxiety No grand inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has
anxiety and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the man he suspects,
choosing the instant when he is weakest; nor knows how to lay traps where
he will be caught and ensnared as anxiety knows how, and no sharp-witted
judge knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused, as anxiety does,
which never lets him escape.
