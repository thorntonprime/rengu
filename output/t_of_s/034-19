Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe
in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do
not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not
believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious
books. Do not believe merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.
