Life is movement; life is action; life is progression; life is growth. We
must ever move forward; we must ever expand. ...Everything moves forward.
No matter what it is in which we may be engaged, we must go forward. The
stream that dashes gaily on its way to the sea is bright and clear and
pure. Not so the stagnant pool, that is filled with impurity and is
unpleasant both to sight and sense of smell.
