The only thing which a man must renounce if he wishes to attain the Supreme
Truth is the notion of individuality—nothing else. ...A man who is entirely
free from the ego-sense is the happiest man in the world. Because, he has
found God—absolute existence, consciousness and bliss—in place of the ego.
