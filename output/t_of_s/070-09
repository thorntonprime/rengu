  - Contentment

Contentment consists not in adding more fuel, but in taking away some fire;
not in multiplying of wealth, but in subtracting menâ€™s desires.
...Generally those who boast most of contentment have least of it. Their
very boasting shows they want something and basely beg it, namely
commendation.
