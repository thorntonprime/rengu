We can do more work in the silence than we can by moving the lips and
letting the mouth make a continuous noise. That interferes with our own
thinking as well as with other people’s. There is a stillness in a
thinker’s mind; there is a quietness in a thinker’s presence, where even
words are entirely unnecessary.
