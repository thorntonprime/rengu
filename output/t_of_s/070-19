  - Contentment
---
Divine discontentment is born of the spirit. It is the will toward freedom
and life, not the discontent of the desirous ego that seeks its own
aggrandizement, or the discontent of the child who clamors for small
satisfactions. It is the discontent that will not let a man rest until he
has found the creative meaning of his own individualized life.
