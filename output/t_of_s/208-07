Words of praise, gratitude, or thanksgiving expand, set free, and in every
way radiate energy. ...You can praise a weak body into strength; a fearful
heart into peace and trust; shattered nerves into poise and power; a
failing business into prosperity and success; want and insufficiency into
supply and support.
