^ People make the mistake of identifyingthemselves with their body, then
ifsomething happens to a person’s body,they think something has happened
tothe person. When you think about it,that’s as ridiculous as saying that
ifsomething happens to the clothing I’mwearing, something has happened
tome. Our body is just what wewear. ...We need to take care of it, butit’s
not who we are.
