The average mind is like a pool of water violently agitated by windstorms：
storms of passion, of desires, of duties to be done, of a hundred demands
upon one’s time, of restless hurrying to- and-fro, of irritations,
anxieties, worries, and a thousand other ills of the mind. Concentration is
the cure.
