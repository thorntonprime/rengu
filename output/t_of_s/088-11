Death is common in the world. Everyone in it must one day or other doff the
physical part of living. Hence, it is not at all proper to be afraid of it.
...While the body perishes, the Spirit is immortal. We are here to realize
we are the spirit. Body is only a vesture, a mask, or a vehicle,
impermanent and transitory.
