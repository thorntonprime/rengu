We can be truly successful only in the work to which we have been called.
The work is not ours, it is Godâ€™s, and we are privileged to be worked
through by God. ...How foolish, then, for anyone to think and proclaim that
he has a certain work to do for God. God may have a certain work to do
through him, that is if he is sufficiently humble, but that is quite a
different thing.
