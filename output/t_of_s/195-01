Remember that you are an actor in a play, and of such sort as the Author
chooses, whether long or short. If it be His good pleasure to assign you
the part of a beggar, a ruler, or a simple citizen, it is yours to play the
role fitly. For your business is to act well the part assigned you; to
choose it, is Anotherâ€™s.
