Emotions are more intense forms of feelings. The feeling of sadness may
build into grief, the feeling of irritation can become a fierce rage. The
distinguishing characteristic of emotion is that it dominates our attention
and cannot be ignored, while a feeling can remain in the backround of
awareness.
