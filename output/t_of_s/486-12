6 * Wealth The imperishable, inexhaustible wealth is the spiritual wealth.
No thief can plunder this. He who has this wealth is the richest man.
...even if he is clad in rags, even if he has nothing to eat. He is the
King of Kings. All other wealthy persons in the world are verily poor. They
are beggers despite their material possessions.
