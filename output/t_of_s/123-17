No man is your enemy; no man is your friend. All alike are your teachers.
Your enemy becomes a mystery that must be solved, even though it takes
ages, for man must be understood. Your friend becomes a part of yourself,
an extension of yourself, a riddle hard to read. Only one thing is more
difficult to knowâ€”your own heart.
