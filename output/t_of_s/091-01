The body is nothing but a covering over our soul, and when it is gone we
are not dead; just as we do not think that we are dead when our coat is
worn out, or if someone tears our shirt. The moment when a person dies is
the only moment when he feels he is dead. The impression of this dying
condition, the hopelessness of the doctor, the sorrow and grief of the
family cause this impression. After death, as he recovers from this, he
gradually finds himself alive. ...for the great burden has been removed.
