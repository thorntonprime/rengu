We live happily indeed, not hating those who hate us. Among men who hate us
we dwell free from hatred!...We live happily indeed, though we call nothing
our own! We shall live like the bright gods, feeding on happiness! Victory
breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has given up victory
and defeat, he, the contented, is happy.
