If you were to practice keeping your mind motionless at all times with the
object of not creating any thought, the result would be no dualism, no
dependence upon others, and no attachment; if you would allow all matters
to take their own course throughout the day as if you were too ill to
bother, without the specific to be known or unknown to others, with a mind
like a block of stone that mends no holes, then the universal law would
deeply impregnate your understanding.
