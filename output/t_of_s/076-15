Death is nothing to fear; the body will go, for it is part of the
manifestation, but our spirit is the undying essence of the absolute. There
is no non-existence, death is just the miraculous, wonderous release of our
spirit into a further journey of unfoldment, an evolution within the realm
that is our home.
