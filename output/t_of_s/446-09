To fully understand the meaning of spirit, we must accept one direct
principle, and that isâ€”life is indestructible. It cannot be destroyed. It
can change form and its rate of living consciousness; it can be transmuted,
and its frequency changed to higher and lower levels, but it cannot be
destroyed.
