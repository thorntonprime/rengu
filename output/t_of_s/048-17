Three things make people want to change. One is that they hurt
sufficiently. They have beat their heads against the same wall so long that
they decide they have had enough. ...Another thing that makes people want
to change is a slow type of despair called ennui, or boredom. ...A third
thing that makes people want to change is the sudden discovery that they
can.
