A human being is part of the whole, called by us the universe; a part
limited by time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical illusion
of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us
to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our
task is to free ourselves from this prison.
