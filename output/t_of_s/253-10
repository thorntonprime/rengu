253 ♦? Humility ■?spr I asked God for strength that I mightachieve. I was
made weak that I mightlearn humbly to obey. I asked forhealth that I might
do greater things. Iwas given infirmity that I might dobetter things. I
asked for riches that Imight be happy. I was given povertythat I might be
wise. I asked for powerthat I might have the praise of men. Iwas given
weakness that I might feelthe need of God. I asked for all thingsthat I
might enjoy life. I was given lifethat I might enjoy all things. I
gotnothing that I asked for, but everythingI hoped for. Almost despite
myself, myunspoken prayers were answered. I am,among all men, most richly
blessed.
