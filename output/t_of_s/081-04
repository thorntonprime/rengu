0 man, do not be afraid of death at all.Thou art immortal. Death is not
theopposite of life. It is only a phase of life.Life flows on ceaselessly.
The fruit per-ishes but the seed is full of life. Theseed dies but a huge
tree grows out ofthe seed. The tree perishes but itbecomes coal which has
rich life. Waterdisappears but it becomes the invisiblesteam which contains
the seed of newlife. The stone disappears but itbecomes lime which is full
of new life.The physical sheath only is thrown butlife persists.
