A vacuum cannot exist in nature. An empty space is immediately filled by
something else. And this law is effective on all levels. If what you give
is luminous, radiant, beneficial, in return you will receive elements of
the same quality, with the same luminous, radiant quintessence. But if you
emanate something filthy, you will at once be filled with filth.
