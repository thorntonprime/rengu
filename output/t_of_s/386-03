The average man takes life as a trouble. He is in a chronic state of
irritation at the whole performance. He does not learn to differentiate
between troubles and difficulties, usually, until some real trouble bowls
him over. He fusses about pinpricks until a mule kicks him. Then he learns
the difference.
