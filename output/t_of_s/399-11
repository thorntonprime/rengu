Religion Religion, wherever it exists, spreads over the whole of life. One
cannot take it up as one takes up golf—by giving it a couple of afternoons
a week. That kind of amateur religion is not religion. Religion is either
the whole of one’s life, or else it is not religion, no matter how much
fuss is made over it.
