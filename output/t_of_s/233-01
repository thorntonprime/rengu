I was never in a hurry in my life. He lives long who enjoys life and bears
no jealousy of others, whose heart harbors no malice or anger, who sings a
lot and cries a little, who rises and retires with the sun, who likes to
work, and who knows how to rest. ...(16&year-old-man) â€”Shirali Mislimov If
you want to enjoy health, start this very moment to cleanse your
consciousness of all wrong thinking and rid it of every thought except the
thought of LOVE.
