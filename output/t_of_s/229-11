229 â™¦? Happiness One of the surest ways to find happiness for yourself is
to devote your energies toward making someone else happy. Happiness is an
elusive, transitory thing. And if you set out in search for it, you will
find it evasive. But if you try to bring happiness to someone else, then it
comes to you.
