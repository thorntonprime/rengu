The self-centered person tests all things by the question, “Am I getting in
marriage the happiness which I deserve?” And yet it is unfair without an
accompanying one： “Am I giving in marriage the best that is possible for me
to give?” Two persons thinking of each other’s happiness will find
themselves sharing a rich store of durable satisfactions.
