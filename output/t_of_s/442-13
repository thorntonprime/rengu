An enormous amount of energy is wasted by excessive talking. The energy
that is spent talking should be carefully and vigilantly conserved and
utilized for spiritual practices and in divine contemplation. The organ of
speech distracts the mind considerably. A talkative man cannot dream of
having peace even for a short time.
