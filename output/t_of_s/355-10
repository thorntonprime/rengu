355 * Peace/Harmony All the frictions, all the uncertainties, all the ills,
the sufferings, the fears, the forebodings, the perplexities of life come
to us because we are out of harmony with the divine purpose of things. They
will continue to come as long as we so live. Rowing against the tide is
hard and uncertain.
