Sometimes we may find that ourpartner continues to seek satisfactionin ways
that we cannot live with.Nevertheless, when we decide to go ourown way we
still have a choice as tohow we separate. We can separate withbad feelings,
blaming the otherâ€™s faultsand unacceptable behavior. Or we canseparate with
forgiveness, love andunderstanding.
