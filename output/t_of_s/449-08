Success is not to be gained by a blind and slavish following of anyone’s
rules or advice, our own any more than any other person’s. There is no
royal road to success-no patent process by which the unsuccessful are to be
magically transformed. ...Rules and advice may greatly assist-and they
undoubtedly do this-but the real work must be accomplished by the
individual. He must carve out his own destiny.
