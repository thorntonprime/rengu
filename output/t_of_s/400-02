Never hurt the feelings of others. Speak the truth. Do not kill any
sentient beings. Cultivate such divine virtues as humility, courage,
forgiveness, tolerance and compassion. Love all, be kind to all. Be good,
do good. Be charitable. Purify the heart. Serve humanity. Share what you
have with others. ...Love thy neighbor as thyself. ...These, indeed,
constitute the essentials of all religions.
