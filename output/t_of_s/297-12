The chess board is the world, the pieces the phenomena of the universe, the
rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the
other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is always fair, just
and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a
mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance.
