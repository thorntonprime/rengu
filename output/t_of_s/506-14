There is nothing to worry about. It is all God and His play. Clouds sweep
over the sky： they appear and disappear; but the sky remains unaffected. So
also the things of the world—its sorrows and its joys—they come and go： but
we are eternal Changeless Existence, full of peace and bliss. We are the
witness of a gigantic cinema show.
