Service rendered as a gift or love- offering to Life： work that is engaged
in, not for self or for profit, but as an act of love and service, these
bring the doer a harvest of blessings. ...When we serve and when we give,
we open ourselves to receive life’s richest blessings, its greatest prizes,
and its most enduring success.
