48 • rp- ■? Change in all things is sweet.. -Aristotle We ought not to
progress in life by aseries of violent jerks, but should learnto navigate
our lives upon the flowingstream of change. By being amenableand adaptable
we should cease toresent either life or conditions, andseek to “change”
them by changing our-selves.
