Dissolution of the body is no more than sleep. Just as a man sleeps and
wakes up, so is death and birth. Death is like sleep. Birth is like waking
up. Death brings promotion to a new and better life. A man of
discrimination and wisdom is not afraid of death. He knows that death is
the gate of life. Death to him is no longer a skeleton bearing a sword to
cut the thread of life, but rather an angel who has a golden key to unlock
for him the door to a wider, fuller and happier existence.
