Our highest hopes are often destroyed to prepare us for better things. The
failure of the caterpillar is the birth of the butterfly; the passing of
the bud is the becoming of the rose; the death or destruction of the seed
is the prelude to its resurrection as wheat. It is at night, in the darkest
hours, those preceding dawn, that plants grow best, that they most increase
in size.
