There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done, there are thousands to
prophesy failure. There are thousands to point out to you, one by one, the
dangers that await to assail you. But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,
just take off your coat and go to it; Just start to sing as you tackle the
thing that “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.
