If anyone could tell you the shortest, surest way to all happiness and
perfection, he must tell you to make a rule to yourself to thank and praise
God for everything that happens to you. For it is certain that whatever
calamity happens to you, if you thank and praise God for it, you turn it
into a blessing.
