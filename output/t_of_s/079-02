Death is simply a shedding of the physical body, like the butterfly coming
out of a cocoon. It is a transition into a higher state of consciousness,
where you continue to perceive, to understand, to laugh, to be able to
grow, and the only thing you lose is something you don’t need anymore.
...your physical body. It’s like putting away your winter coat when spring
comes.
