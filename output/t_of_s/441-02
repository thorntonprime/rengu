Should you band together the legs of two birds with a short rope an
interesting phenomenon will take place. Each bird will hamper the other
during their attempts to fly. Both birds will remain grounded. The same
analogy can be applied to spiritual matters. Self-realization is a solitary
affair in which each pilgrim must travel unhindered, alone.
