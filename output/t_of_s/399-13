A sage once said： “It is good to be born into a church, but it is bad to
die in a church,” which meant that while we are born into a religion, we
have no choice about it. As we grow up and expand in wisdom we should be
tolerant and our love and sympathy and understanding should go beyond the
borders of our own religion.
