Judging others will avail you nothing and injure you spiritually. Only if
you can inspire others to judge themselves will anything worthwhile have
been accomplished. When you approach others in judgement they will be on
the defensive. When you are able to approach them in a kindly, loving
manner without judgement they will tend to judge themselves and be
transformed.
