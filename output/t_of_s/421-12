1 * Self-Reliance The man who is self-reliant, always says： “No one can
realize my possibilities for me, but me; no one can make me good or evil
but myself.” He works out his own salvation, financially, socially,
mentally, physically, and morally. Life is an individual problem that man
must solve for himself.
