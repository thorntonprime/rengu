There are two laws known by spiritual teachers everywhere, and in all ages,
which must be at all times obeyed, for most dire consequences follow their
disregard or violation. ...That on no account a charge be demanded for
revealing spiritual truths and that all money received by the teacher be
regarded as Godâ€™s and used accordingly.
