2 * Thoughts ? If your thoughts center round the body, you will have
worries about pains and illnesses, real or imaginary; if they are centered
on riches, you will be worried about profit and loss, tax and exemptions,
investment and insolvency; if they roam round fame, then you are bound to
suffer from the ups and downs of scandal, calumny and jealousy.
