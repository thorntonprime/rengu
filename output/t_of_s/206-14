There is an inherent law of mind that we increase whatever we praise. The
whole of creation responds to praise and is glad. Animal trainers pet and
reward their charges with delicacies for acts of obedience; children grow
with joy and gladness when they are praised. Even vegetation grows better
for those who love it.
