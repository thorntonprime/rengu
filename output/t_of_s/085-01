The loss of friends by the transition we call death will not cause sorrow
to the soul that has come into this higher realization. ...that there is no
such thing as death, for each one is not only a partaker, but an eternal
partaker, of this Infinite Life. He knows that the mere falling away of the
physical body by no means affects real soul life.
