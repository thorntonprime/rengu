The Kingdom of Heaven is perfect trust, perfect knowledge, perfect peace.
All is music, sweetness, and tranquility. No irritations, no bad tempers,
no harsh words, no suspicions, no lust, and no disturbing elements can
enter there. ...It is literally true that when men die they “go to heaven
and hell,” in accordance with their deeds. But the heaven and hell are in
this world.
