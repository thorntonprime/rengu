---
It is eternity now. I am in the midst of it. It is about me in the
sunshine; I am in it, as the butterfly in the light-laden air. Nothing has
to come, it is now. Now is eternity; now is the immortal life -â€”Richard
Jefferies There is only one way to get ready for immortality, and that is
to love this life and live it as bravely and faithfully and cheerfully as
we can.
