The greatest joy in life is service. The greatest power in life is love.
The greatest battle in life is the battle against oneself. The greatest
enemy that man of earth shall ever know is in his own thinking. The
greatest poverty that man of earth shall ever know is impoverished
thinking; and the greatest blessing man shall ever know is the blessings of
spiritual riches.
