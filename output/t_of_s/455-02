When someone beats a rug with a stick, he is not beating the rug—his aim is
to get rid of the dust from the veil of I-ness and that dust will not leave
all at once. With every cruelty and every blow, it departs little by
little, from the heart’s face, sometimes in sleep and sometimes in
wakefulness.
