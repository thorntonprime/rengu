9 * Faith Blind faith should be turned into rational faith. Faith without
understanding is only blind faith. Devotion is the development of faith.
Knowledge is the development of devotion. Faith leads to the final
spiritual experience. Whatever a person strongly believes in, that he
experiences and becomes.
