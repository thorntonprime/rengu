Death is an event whereby the body disappears in one way or another—buried
or cremated—and the breath in the body ceases and mingles with the air
outside, and consciousness which had trapped itself within a body (and had
identified itself with it) is released and becomes the universal
consciousness, like a drop of rain water falling in the river.
