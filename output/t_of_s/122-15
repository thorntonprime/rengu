Joy or bitterness is largely an outcome of the cultivation and guidance of
emotions. While this applies to all personal relationships, it is
especially weighty in marriage. Emotional attitudes may be either the
positive and constructive emotions of love and trust, or the negative and
potentially destructive emotions of fear and hatred.
