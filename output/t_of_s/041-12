The whole of human life is cause and effect; there is no such thing in it
as chance, nor is there even in all the wide universe. ...Let him never
forget that whatever he may get for himself at the expense of someone else.
...will by a law equally subtle, equally powerful, be turned into ashes in
his very hands.
