Vanity is an inordinate desire for the notice, approval, or praise of
others. ...Vanity is always a mark of inferiority. All exaggerated
attitudes of superior knowledge, wisdom, authority and morality are
unmistaken indicators of the opposite qualities. They are the most obvious
attempts to pose as superiority, weakness masquerading as strength.
