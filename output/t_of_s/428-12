Silence True silence really means going deep within yourself to that place
where nothing is happening, where you transcend time and space. You go into
a brand new dimension of nothingness. That’s where all the power is. That’s
your real home. That’s where you really belong, in deep Silence where there
is no good or bad, no one trying to achieve anything. Just being, pure
being. ...Silence is the ultimate reality.
