The moment comes when the great nurse, death, takes man, the child, by the
hand and quietly says, “It is time to go home. Night is coming. It is your
bedtime, child of earth. Come; you’re tired. Lie down at last in the quiet
nursery of nature and sleep. Sleep well. The day is gone. Stars shine in
the canopy of eternity.”
