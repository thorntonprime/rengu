You must not think of the light of the sun as the true Light of God. It is
a reflection of the true Light. That other Light, that we can neither know
nor comprehend, is so subtle, so highly potent that, for us, and even for
many creatures of the spirit world who are far more advanced than we, it is
darkness.
