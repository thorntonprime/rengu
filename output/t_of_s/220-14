I have fixed the habit in my mind that I never raise a glass of water to my
lips without asking God’s blessings, never seal a letter without putting a
word of prayer under the seal, never take a letter from the post without a
brief sending of my thoughts heavenward, never change classes in the
lecture room without a minute’s petition for the cadets who go out and for
the cadets who come in.
