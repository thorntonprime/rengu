Accept every event in your life as natural, whether it is life, death,
birth, marriage, goings or comings. Accept everyone. Do not argue. Do not
question. Do not doubt. Do not judge. You will find that each step will
lead on to another one, and when you start living this way there will be a
great rejoicing in the heavens because a prodigal son or daughter is
beginning to return home.
