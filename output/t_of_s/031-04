The millions are awake enough forphysical labor; but only one in a mil-lion
is awake enough for effective intel-lectual exertion, only one in a
hundredmillion to a poetic or divine life. To beawake is to be alive. ...We
must learn toreawaken and keep ourselves awake,not by mechanical means, but
by aninfinite expectation of the dawn.
