9 â™¦? Hear & Now ? Today is, for all that we know, the opportunity and
occasion of our lives. On what we do or say today may depend the success
and completeness of our entire life-struggle. It is for us, therefore, to
use every moment of today as if our very eternity were dependent on its
words and deeds.
