High on the wall, in the castle of your dreams of success, hangs the
picture of what you want to be. Always keep that picture hanging there. See
yourself where you intend to be. Night and day dream of what you intend to
do and what you intend to be, for your dreams interpret your intentions
always. All successes are, at first, dreams.
