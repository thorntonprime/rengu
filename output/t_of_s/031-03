The spiritual journey does not consistin arriving at a new destination
wherea person gains what he did not have, orbecomes what he is not. It
consists inthe dissipation of one’s own ignoranceconcerning oneself and
life, and thegradual growth of that understandingwhich begins the spiritual
awakening.The finding of God is a coming to one’sself.
