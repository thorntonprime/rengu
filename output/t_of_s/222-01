222 Happiness If you want happiness for an hour— take a nap. If you want
happiness for a day—go fishing. If you want happiness for a month—get
married. If you want happiness for a year—inherit a fortune. If you want
happiness for a lifetime— help someone else. If you want eternal
happiness—know yourself.
