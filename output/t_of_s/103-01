â€˜SP? Sensual pleasure is tantalizing. There is enchantment only as long as
a person does not possess the object. He exerts hard. His mind is full of
anxiety. He is under despondency as to whether he will secure the object or
not. The moment he is in possession of the object, the charm vanishes. He
finds that he is entangled.
