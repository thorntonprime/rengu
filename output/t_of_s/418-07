It is from selfishness that everythingevil proceeds. Study all the vices,
andyou will see that selfishness is at thebottom of them all. Combat them
asyou will, you will never succeed inextirpating them until, attacking
theevil in it root, you have destroyed theselfishness which is their cause.
Let allyour efforts tend to this end; forselfishness is the veritable
social gangrene.
