Why were saints, saints? Because they were cheerful when it was difficult
to be cheerful, patient when it was difficult to be patient, and because
they pushed on when they wanted to stand still, and kept silent when they
wanted to talk; and were agreeable when they wanted to be disagreeable.
That was all. It was quite simple and always will be.
