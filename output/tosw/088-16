Death is a beautiful liberation into freer life. The limiting clay garment,
the body, is put aside. The self-centered nature goes with you to learn and
grow on the disembodied side of life, and then returns here into a suitable
clay garment and suitable circumstances to learn the lessons we need to
learn.
