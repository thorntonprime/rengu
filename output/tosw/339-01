You don’t get old from living a particular number of years： you get old
because you have deserted your ideals. Years wrinkle your skin, renouncing
your ideals wrinkles your soul. Worry, doubt, fear and despair are the
enemies which slowly bring us down to the ground and turn us to dust before
we die.
