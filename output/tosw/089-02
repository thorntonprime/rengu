No man who is fit to live need fear to die. To us here, death is the most
terrible thing we know. But when we have tasted its reality it will mean to
us birth, deliverance, a new creation of ourselves. It will be what health
is to the sick man; what home is to the exile; what the loved one given
back is to the bereaved.
