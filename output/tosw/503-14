Do your work in the world, but inward-ly keep quiet. Then all will come to
you.Do not rely on your own work for real-ization. It may profit others but
notyou. Your hope lies in keeping silent inyour mind and quiet in your
heart. â€”Nisargadatta & Worry orry is a useless mulling overof things we
cannot change. Worry is not concern, which wouldmotivate you to do
everything possiblein a situation.
