Do not stand at my grave and weep; I am not there. I do not sleep. I am a
thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the
sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn’s rain. When you awaken
in the morning’s hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in
circled light. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my
grave and cry; I am not there. I did not die.
