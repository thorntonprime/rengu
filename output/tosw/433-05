The art of simplicity is simply to simplify. ...Simplicity avoids the
superficial, penetrates the complex, goes to the heart of the problem, and
pinpoints the key factors. Simplicity does not beat around the bush. It
does not take winding detours. It follows a straight line to the objective.
Simplicity is the shortest distance between two points.
