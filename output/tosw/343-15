The drop of water is only weak when it is removed from the ocean; replace
it and it is as powerful as the ocean. ...If a portion of one unit excludes
itself from the whole, it makes no difference to Principal Being, but it
makes a vast difference to the unit. The ocean is not conscious of the
removal of a drop of water, but the drop is very conscious of the ocean
when it is returned.
