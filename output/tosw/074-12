Death as finality or extinction is only aconcept of thought, and has no
reality.Our spiritual essence will continue toflow with the whole and ever
changeand evolve. Thus, through the death ofform we evolve and find
renewal. Inform our energy radiates outward, andwe relate to this energy
vibratingaround us; but in death of form, ourenergy radiates inward as we
go backinto the center of our essence.
