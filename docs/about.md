# Introduction

 `In a holy book I have there are pages from the Bible and the Koran.
And pages from the sutras and from the Upanishads, the Torah, and the
 Gita.
And pages of things that unknown saints wrote in collaboration with
 the heavens that people have never seen.
And pages of the wisdom of animals and their young singing while they
 played, the way we once did with the stars.
And pages of plants and pages of sounds. And pages of earths.
Yes, it is all there in my soul, anything ink has ever preserved,
 anything that stone ever
begged to have carved on it, anything any instrument gifted from its
 mind, or a brush left for us to see. Any space sanctified by dance, I
 know.
And anything that will ever be, written in your heart. You, the eyes
 or ears and cells that now hear this.
In a holy book I have, in a sacred text I carry, is the face of
 everyone who will ever be.`
