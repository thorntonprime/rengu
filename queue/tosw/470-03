All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded upon
our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with
an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox
that draws the carriage. ... If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought,
happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.
