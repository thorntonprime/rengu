Meditation is not some strange technique that we have to learn with great
effort and difficulty. ... Whatever we accomplish in this world we
accomplish through the power of concentration, which is nothing but medita-
tion. ... Above all, meditation stills the wandering mind and establishes us
forever in a state of peace.
