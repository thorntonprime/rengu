People with material wealth and enjoyments do not generally feel the
necessity to think of God. ... Man depends upon wealth and gloryâ€”the so-
called good things for his joy. They are illusive. The joy you receive from
them is a flicker. Next second the light is gone and you are enveloped in
the darkness.
