  - Senility is not confined to old
---
Some people never seem to grow old. Always active in thought, always ready
to adopt new ideas, they are never chargeable to fogeyism. Satisfied, yet
ever dissatisfied, settled, yet ever unsettled, they always enjoy the best
of what is, and are the first to find the best of what will be.
