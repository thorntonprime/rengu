Virtue and wisdom are sublime things;but if they create pride and a con-
sciousness of separateness from the restof humanity in the mind of man,
thenthey are only the snakes of self(ishness)reappearing in a finer form.
...A manwho becomes selfish isolates himself,grows less interesting and
less agree-able to others.
