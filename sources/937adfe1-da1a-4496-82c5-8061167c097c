Description: |
  Some things never change, including the human need to
  connect with our creator. Prayer and meditation on the divine are techniques
  that have been used for millennia to grow in the knowledge of God. Cloud
  of Unknowing documents techniques used by the medieval monastic community
  to build and maintain that contemplative knowledge of God. Scholars date
  the anonymous authorship of Cloud of Unknowing to 1375, during the height
  of European monasticism. Written as a primer for the young monastic, the
  work is instructional, but does not have an austere didactic tone. Rather,
  the work embraces the reader with a maternal call to grow closer to God
  through meditation and prayer.
