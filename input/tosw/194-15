A tragic mistake that is often made by orthodox religious people is to
assume that the Will of God for them is bound to be something very dull and
uninviting, if not positively unpleasant. The truth is that the Will of God
for us always means greater freedom, greater self-expression, wider and
newer and brighter experience.
