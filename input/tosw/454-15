If you know the purpose of suffering—to burn up your ego—you’ll even
rejoicein it. Suffering is a way of purification.You heat your mind and
body to trans-form it, burning out the undesirableimpurities. Just as gold
ore is repeated-ly heated and cooled to raise its purity,all individuals
are purified by the heatof suffering. So accept suffering as itcomes.
