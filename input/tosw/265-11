The world is an illusion. Why is itunreal? Because none of the knowledgeis
going to remain permanent, as realknowledge. I had a number ofidentities; I
was a child, I was a boy, Iwas a teenager, I was a middle-agedman, I was an
old man. Like otheridentities I thought would remainconstant, they never
remained so.Finally, I became very old. ... So whichidentity remained honest
with me?
