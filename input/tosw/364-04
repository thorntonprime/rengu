The optimist is right. The pessimist is right. The one differs from the
other as the light from the dark. Yet both are right. Each is right from
his own particular point of view, and this point of view is the determining
factor in the life of each. It determines as to whether it is a life of
power or of impotence, of peace or of pain, of success or of failure.
