What comfort, what strength, what economy there is in order. ... To know
where one is going and what one wishes—this is order; to keep one’s word
and one’s engagements—again order ... to discipline one’s habits, one’s
efforts, one’s wishes; to organize one’s life, to distribute one’s time.
...all this belongs to and is included in the word order.
