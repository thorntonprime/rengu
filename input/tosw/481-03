When once we KNOW the Truth, no one can take it away from us. We have
entered into the Eternal. ...When we KNOW the Truth. ...we enter into
Realityï¼š we see things as they are in God, and not as they falsely appear
to the senses. All problems are solved, and all our questions answered; or,
rather, they are transcended, and we find there are no problems to be
solved and no questions to be answered, simply because we KNOW.
