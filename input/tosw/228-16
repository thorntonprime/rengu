The ingredients of happiness are so simple that they can be counted on one
hand. First of all, happiness must be shared. Selfishness is its enemy; to
make another happy is to be happy oneâ€™s self. It is quiet, seldom found for
long in crowds, most easily won in moments of solitude and reflection. It
comes from within, and rests most securely on simple goodness and clear
conscience.
