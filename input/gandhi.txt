MARCH 1 Truth is like a vast tree, which yields
more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in
the mine of Truth the richer the discovery of the gems buffed there,
in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service. Auto,
p. 218 MARCH 2 The seeker after Truth should be humbier than the dust. The
world crushes the dust under its feet, but the seeker after Truth should
so humble himself that even the 24

dust could crush him. Only then, and not until then, will he have a glimpse
of truth. Ibid., p. XVI MARCH 3 Devotion to Truth is the sole reason, for
our existence. All our activities should be centred in Truth. Truth should
be the very breath of our life. When once this stage in the pilgrim's
progress is reached, all other rules of correct living will come without
effort, and obedience to them will be instinctive. But without Truth it
would be impossible to observe any principles or rules in life. TI, 30
July 1931 MARCH 4 There should be Truth in thought, Truth in speech, and
Truth in action. To the man who has realized this Truth in, perfection,
nothing else remains to be known, because all knowledge is necessarily
included in it. What is not included in it is not Truth and so not true
knowledge~ and there can be no inward peace without the true knowledge. If
we once learn how to apply this never-failing test of Truth. 25

we ~wil,1 at once be able to find out what is worth~ being, what is worth
seeing and what is worth reading. Ibid. MARCH 5 ~The quest Qf Truth involves
tapas-~e!f-suffering, sometin~s even unto death. There can be no place in
it for even a trace of self-inteÂ¢est. In such selfless search for Truth
nobody ,can lose his bearings for long. Directly dne takes to the wrong
path one ~stumbles and is thus redirected to the right path. Therefore
the pursuit of Truth is ,true bhakti (devotion). It is the path that leads
to God and therefore there is no place in it for cowardice, no place for
defeat. It is the talisman by which death itself becomes the portal to
life eternal. Yy, 30 yuty 1931 MARCH 6 It is not given to man to know the
whole Truth. His duty lies in !lying up to the Truth as he sees it and
in doing so to resort xo the purest means, i.e., to non-violence. J-I,
24 Xov. 1933 26

MARCH 7 If observance of Truth was a bed of roses, if Truth cost one
nothing and was all happiness and ease, there would be~ no beauty about
it, We must adhere to Truth even if the heav, ens should fall. YI, 27
Sept. 1928 MARCH 8 Only Truth quenches untruth, Love quenches anger,
self-suffering quenches violence. This eternal rule is a rule not for
saints only but for all. Those who observe it may be few but they are the
salt of the earth, it is they who keep the society together, not those who
sin against light and truth., H, 1 Feb. 1942 MARCH 9 Abstract Truth has no
value, unless it incarnates in human beings who represent it by proving
their readiness to die for it. Our wrongs live because we only pretend
to be their living representatives. The only way we can prove our claim
is by readiness to suffer in the discharge of our trust. YI, 22 Dec. 1921
