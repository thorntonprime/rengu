1936 JANUARY 15 God is the hardest taskmaster I have known on this earth,
and He tries you through and through. And when you find that your faith
is failing or your body is failing you, and you are sinking, He comes to
your assistance somehow or other and proves to you that you must not lose
your faith and that He is always at your beck  8

and call, but on His terms, not on your terms. So I have found. I cannot
really recall a single instance when, at the eleventh hour, He has forsaken
me. SW, p. 1069

JANUARY 16 The divine guidance often comes when the horizon is the
blackest. YI, 27 Aug. 1925

JANUARY 17 God helps when one feels onself humbler than the very dust under
one's feet. Only to the weak and helpless is divine succour vouchsafed.

JANUARY 18 Mankind is notoriously too dense to read the signs that God
sends from time to time. We require drums to be beaten into our ears,
before we would wake from our trance and hear the warning and see that
to lose oneself in all is the only way to find oneself.

YI, 25 Aug. 1927

JANUARY 19 If you would ask Him to help you, you would go to Him in all your
nakedness, approach Him without reservations, also without fear or doubts
as to how He can help a fallen being like you. He who has hell~ed millions
who have approached Him, is He going to desert you? YI, 1 March 1929

JANUARY 20 Man's ultimate aim is the realization .of God, and all his
activities, social, political, religious, have to be guided by the
ultimate aim of the vision of God. The immediate service of all human
beings becomes a necessary part of the endeavour, simply because the only
way to find God is to see Him in His creation and be one with it. This
can only be done by service of all. I am a part and parcel of the whole,
and I cannot find Him apart from the rest of humanity. H, 29 Aug. 1936

JANUARY 21 God is a very hard taskmaster. He is never satisfied with
fireworks display. His

mills although they grind surely and incessantly grind excruciatingly
stow and He is never satisfied with hasty forfeitures of life. It
is a sacrifice of the purest that He demands, and so you and I have
prayerfully to plod on, "live out the life so long as it is vouchsafed
to us to live it. 22 Sept. 1927 JANUARY 22 God keeps an accurate record
of all things good and bad. There is no better .accountant on earth. H,
21 Sept. 1934 JANUARY 23 If God was a capricious person instead ,of being
the changeless, unchangeable living law, He would in sheer indignation
wipe out those who in the name of religion deny Him and His Law. YI,
11 July 1929 JANUARY 24 God tries His votaries through and through, but
never beyond endurance. He gives them strength enough to go through the
ordeal He prescribes for them. , YI, 19 Feb. 1925

JANUARY 25 God to be God must rule the heart and transforfla it. He must
express Himself in every smallest act of His votary. This can only be
done through a definite realization more real than the five senses can
ever produce, rI, 11 Oct. 1928

JANUARY 26 Where there i~ realization outside the senses it is
infallible. It is proved not by extraneous evidence but in the transformed
conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God
within. Such testimony is to be found in the experiences of an unbroken
line of prophets and sages in all countries and climes. 'To reject this
evidence is to deny oneself. Ibid.

JANUARY 27 But it is impossible for us to realize perfect Truth so long
as we are imprisoned in this mortal frame. We can only visualize it in
our imagination. We cannot, through the instrumentality of this ephemeral
body, see face to face Truth which is eternal. That

is why in the last resort we must depend on faith. YM, Chap. II JANUARY
28 No one can attain perfection while he is in the body for the simple
reason that the ideal state is impossible so long as one has not completely
overcome his ego, and ego cannot be wholly got rid of so long as one is
tied down by the shackles of the flesh. YI, 20 Sept. 1928 JANUARY 29 Our
existence as embodied beings is purely momentary; what are a hundred years
in eternity? But if we shatter the chains of egotism, and welt into the
ocean of humanity, we share its dignity. To feel that we are something is
to set up a barrier between God and ourselves; to cease feeling that we
are something is to become one with God. YM, Chap. XII JANUARY 30 A drop
in the ocean partakes of the greatness of its parent, although it is un13

conscious of it. But it is dried up as soon as it enters upon an existence
independent of the ocean. We do not exaggerate when we say that life is
a bubble.

I'M, Chap. II

JANUARY 31 As soon as we become one with the ocean in the shape of God,
there is no more rest for us, nor indeed do we need rest any longer. Our
very sleep is action. For we sleep with the thought of God in our
hearts. This restlessness constitutes true rest. This never-ceasing
agitation holds the key to peace ineffable. This supreme state of total
surrender is difficult to describe, but not beyond the bounds of human
experience. It has been attained by many dedicated souls, and may be
attained by ourselves as well.

FEBRUARY ! Where Love is, there God is ~tso. SSA, p. 360 14

FEBRUARY 2 Love never claims, it ever gives. Love ever suffers, never
resents, never revenges itself.

YI, 9 July 1925

FEBRUARY 3 I believe that the sum total of the energy of mankind is not to
bring us down but to lift us up, and that is the result of the definite,
if unconscious, working of the law of love. The fact that mankind persists
shows that the cohesive force is greater than the disruptive force,
centripetal force greater than centrifugal. YI, 12 Nov. 1931

FEBRUARY 4

Scientists tell us that without the presence of the cohesive force amongst
the atoms that comprise this globe of ours, it would crumble to pieces
and we would cease to exist; and even as there is cohesive force in blind
matter, so must there be in all things animate and tlie name for that
cohesive force among animate beings is Love. YI, 5 May 1920

FEBRUARY 5 We notice it between father and son, between brother and sister,
friend and friend. But we have to learn to use that force among all that
lives, and in the use of it consists our knowledge of God. Where there
is love there is life; hatred leads to destruction. Ibid. FEBRUARY 6 I
have found that life persists in the midst of destruction and therefore
there must be a higher law than that of destruction. Only under that law
would a well-ordered society be intelligible and life worth living. ~'I,
1 Oct. 1931 FEBRUARY 7 If love was not the law of life, life would not
have persisted in the midst of death. Life is a perpetual triumph over the
grave. H, 26 Sept. 1936 FEBRUARY 8 If there is a fundamental distinction
between man and beast, it is the former's 16

progressive recognition of the law and its application in practice to
his own personal life. All the saints of the world, ancient and modern,
were each according to his light and capacity a living illustration of
that supreme Law of our Being. Ibid.

FEBRUARY 9 The forms are many, but the informing spirit is one. How
can there be room for distinctions of high and low where there is this
all-embracing fundamental unity underlying the outward diversity? For
that is a fact meeting you at every step in daily life. The final goal
of all religions is to realize this essential oneness. H, 15 Dee. 1933

FEBRUARY 10 We must widen the circle of our love till it embraces the whole
village; the village in its turn must take into its fold the district,
the district the province, and so on till the scope of our love becomes
coterminous with the world. YI, 27 June 1929 17

FEBRUARY 11" Not killing competition, but life-giving co-operation,
is the law of the human being. Ignoring the emotion is to forget that
man has feelings. Not the good of the few, not even good of the many,
but it is the good of all that we are made to promote, if we are 'made in
His own image'. SW, p. 350 FEBRUARY 12 The golden rule of conduct.., is
mutual toleration, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall
always see Truth in fragment and from different angles of vision. YI,
23 Sept. 1926 FEBRUARY 13 A seeker after Truth, a follower of the Law
of Love, cannot hold anything against tomorrow. God never provides for
the morrow. He never creates more than what is strictly needed from day
to day. If, therefore, we repose faith in His Providence, we should rest
assured that He will give us every day our daily bread, supplying enough
that we require. YI, 4 Sept. 1930 18

FEBRUARY 14 We are either ignoxant or ~g.ligent of the Divil~e Law in
vixtue of which roan h~ been given only his daily bread and no' more,
with the result that tlz~er~arise inequalities with all the misery
attendant upon them. Ibid.  FEBRUARY 15z The rich have a superfluous
store of things which they do not need and which are, therefore, neglected
and wasted; while millions starve and are frozen to death for want of
them. If each retained possession only of what he needed, none would be
in want and all-would live in contentment. Ibi/t. FEBRUARY 16 As it is,
the rich are discontented no less than the poor. The poor man would become
a millionaire and the millionaire a multimillionaire. The poor are often
not satisfied when they get just enough to fill their stomachs; but they
are clearly entitled to it and society should makeit a point to see that
they get it. Ibid.

FEBRUARY 17 Our civilization, our culture, our Swaraj depend not
upon multiplying our wants-self-indulgence, but upon restricting our
~vants--self-denial.

YI, 6 Oct. 1921

FEBRUARY 18 We should be ashamed of resting, or having a square meal so
long as there is one able-bodied man or woman without work or food, YI,
5 Feb. 1925

FEBRUARY 19 I suggest we are thieves in a way, if I take anything that
I do not need for my own immediate use and keep it, I thieve it from
somebody else, sW, p. 3e4

FEBRUARY 20 I venture to suggest that it is the fundamental law of Nature,
without exception, that Nature produces enough for our wants from day
to day, and if only everybody took enough for himself and nothing more,
there 20

would be no pauperism in this world, there would be no man dying of
starvation in this world.

Ibid.

FEBRUARY 21 i am no socialist and I do not want to dispossess those who
have got possessions： but I do say that personally those of us who
want to see light out of darkness have to follow this rule. I do not
want to dispossess anybody. I should then be departing from the rule of
Ahimsa. If somebody else possesses more than I do, let him. But so far as
my own life has to be regulated, I dare not possess anything which I do
not Want. Ibid. FEBRUARY 22 In India we have got three millions of people
who have to be satisfied with one meal a day, and that meal consisting
of a chapati containing no fat in it and a pinch of salt. You and I have
no right to anything that we really have until these three millions are,
clothed and fed better. You and I, who ought to know better, must adjust
our wants, and even undergo voluntary starvation in 21

vrder that they may be nursed, fed, and clothed, . ~ ' .~ sw, p. 385
FEBRUARY 23 The golden rule , is resolutely to ~6fuse to have what
millions cannot. This ability to refuse will not descend upon us M1 of a
sudden. The first thing is to cultivate the mental,attitude that will not
have possession or facilities denied to millions, and the next immediate
thing is to rearrange our lives as fast as possible in accordance with
that mentality. Y I, ：~4 June 1926 FEBRUARY 24 One should eatnot .in
order to please the palate, but just to keep body going. When each organ
of sense subserves the body and through the body the soul, its special
relish disappears andthen alone does it begin to function in the way nature
intended it tO do. .Any number of experiments is too small and no sacrifice
too great for attaining this symphony with natffre. Auto, p. 392 22

FEBRUARY 25 We want healers of souls rather than of bodies. The multiplicity
of hospitals and medical men is no sign of true civilization. The less
we and others pamper our bodies the better for us and the world. 17,
29 Sept. 1927 FEBRUARY 26 Instead of using the body as a temple of God
we use it as a vehicle for indulgences and are not ashamed to run to
medical men for help in our effort to increase them and abuse the earthly
tabernacle. YI, 8 Aug. 1929 FEBRUARY 27 Man's nature is not .essentially
evil. Brute nature has been known to yield to the influence of love. You
must never despair of human nature. H, 5 Nov. 1938 FEBRUARY 28 Man's
estate is one of probation. During that period he is played upon by evil
forces as well as good. He is ever prey to 23

temptations. He has to pro~ce his manliness by resisting and fighting
temptations. H, 4 April 1936 FEBRUARY 29 It may be long before the law
of love will be recognized in international affairs. The machineries of
governments stand between and hide the hearts of one people from those of
another, rI, 23 June 1919 MARCH 1 Truth is like a vast tree, which yields
more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in
the mine of Truth the richer the discovery of the gems buffed there,
in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service. Auto,
p. 218 MARCH 2 The seeker after Truth should be humbier than the dust. The
world crushes the dust under its feet, but the seeker after Truth should
so humble himself that even the 24

dust could crush him. Only then, and not until then, will he have a glimpse
of truth. Ibid., p. XVI MARCH 3 Devotion to Truth is the sole reason, for
our existence. All our activities should be centred in Truth. Truth should
be the very breath of our life. When once this stage in the pilgrim's
progress is reached, all other rules of correct living will come without
effort, and obedience to them will be instinctive. But without Truth it
would be impossible to observe any principles or rules in life. TI, 30
July 1931 MARCH 4 There should be Truth in thought, Truth in speech, and
Truth in action. To the man who has realized this Truth in, perfection,
nothing else remains to be known, because all knowledge is necessarily
included in it. What is not included in it is not Truth and so not true
knowledge~ and there can be no inward peace without the true knowledge. If
we once learn how to apply this never-failing test of Truth. 25

we ~wil,1 at once be able to find out what is worth~ being, what is worth
seeing and what is worth reading. Ibid. MARCH 5 ~The quest Qf Truth involves
tapas-~e!f-suffering, sometin~s even unto death. There can be no place in
it for even a trace of self-inte¢est. In such selfless search for Truth
nobody ,can lose his bearings for long. Directly dne takes to the wrong
path one ~stumbles and is thus redirected to the right path. Therefore
the pursuit of Truth is ,true bhakti (devotion). It is the path that leads
to God and therefore there is no place in it for cowardice, no place for
defeat. It is the talisman by which death itself becomes the portal to
life eternal. Yy, 30 yuty 1931 MARCH 6 It is not given to man to know the
whole Truth. His duty lies in !lying up to the Truth as he sees it and
in doing so to resort xo the purest means, i.e., to non-violence. J-I,
24 Xov. 1933 26

MARCH 7 If observance of Truth was a bed of roses, if Truth cost one
nothing and was all happiness and ease, there would be~ no beauty about
it, We must adhere to Truth even if the heav, ens should fall. YI, 27
Sept. 1928 MARCH 8 Only Truth quenches untruth, Love quenches anger,
self-suffering quenches violence. This eternal rule is a rule not for
saints only but for all. Those who observe it may be few but they are the
salt of the earth, it is they who keep the society together, not those who
sin against light and truth., H, 1 Feb. 1942 MARCH 9 Abstract Truth has no
value, unless it incarnates in human beings who represent it by proving
their readiness to die for it. Our wrongs live because we only pretend
to be their living representatives. The only way we can prove our claim
is by readiness to suffer in the discharge of our trust. YI, 22 Dec. 1921
