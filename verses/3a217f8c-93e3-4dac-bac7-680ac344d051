Title: It Cuts the Plow Reins
---
What does purity do? It cuts the plow reins. It keeps you from working and
dining in the mud.

It frees you from living behind a big ox that bites.

What can purity do, my dear? It can lift your heart on a rising, bucking Sun
that makes the soul hunger to reach the roof of creation.

It offers what the whole world wants： real knowledge and power.

It offers what the wise crave： the priceless treasure of freedom.

Pure divine love is no meek priest or tight banker;

it will smash all your windows and only then throw in the holy gifts.
