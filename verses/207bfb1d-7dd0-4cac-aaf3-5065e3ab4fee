When government meanders
The people are straightforward.
When government interferes
The people are cunning.
The fortunate leans on the unfortunate,
The unfortunate crouches beneath the fortunate.
Who knows when to stop?
Where is the simple?
The simple becomes cunning,
The good becomes perverse.
The people have certainly
Been wrong for a long time!
So the wise are foursquare
But not sharp.
Have corners
But don’t cut.
Extend themselves
But spare others.
Shine out
But don’t glare.
