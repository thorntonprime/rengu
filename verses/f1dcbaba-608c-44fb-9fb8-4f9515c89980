Chuang-tzu was one day fishing, when the Prince of Ch'u sent two high
officials to interview him, saying that His Highness would be glad of
Chuang-tzu’s assistance in the administration of his government. The
latter quietly fished on, and without looking around, replied： “I have
heard that in the state of Ch’u there is a sacred tortoise, which has been
dead three thousand years, and which the Prince keeps packed up in a box on
the altar, in his ancestral shrine. Now do you think that tortoise would
rather be dead and have its remains thus honored, or be alive and wagging
its tail in the mud?” The two officials answered that no doubt it would
rather be alive and wagging its tail in the mud; whereupon Chuang-tzu cried
out： “Begone! I, too, elect to remain, wagging my tail in the mud.”
