It is truly beyond human nature to possess wings and fly on high at one’s own
will. But to receive this gift of wings, almost contrary to nature, this is
surely like the possession strengthened by exercise, of a marvellous ability
for contemplation, so that you may when you will, penetrate on the wing of
clear sight into the difficult regions of secret knowledge, impenetrable
to mere human effort. Truly we begin to be winged creatures, when having
received the gift of grace divinely, we transcend the bounds of our human
state, by the flight of our contemplation. For every kind of prophecy,
unless it is received in ecstasy, belongs to this ... uplifting. Is it not
a thing beyond human nature to see past things which are not existing now,
or to see future things which are not yet? so also to see present things
which are not present to the sense, to see the secrets of another’s heart,
a thing not subject to any sense; to have knowledge of divine things which
are above the sense sphere?
