Commentary: As the same auithority elsewhere points out, it is not the lack of
  the sacraments, but the contemning of them, which prevents salvation.

Dost thou tell me that he who has not the sacraments of God cannot be saved? I
tell thee that he who has the virtue of the sacraments of God cannot perish.
Which is greater, the sacrament or the virtue of the sacrament—water or faith?
If thou wouldst speak truly, answer, ‘faith’.
