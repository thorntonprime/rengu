The lights of all prophethood shone forth from his (Muhammad’s)
light. ... His existence was before the nothingness (which preceded creation);
his name was before the Pen. ... All sciences are as a drop from his sea, and
all wisdoms as a sip from his river, and all time is but as an hour of his
enduring. In him is Reality (al-haqq) and in him is Truth (al-haqiqah). He
is the first in Union and the last in Prophethood; the inward in Truth and
the outward in Knowledge.
