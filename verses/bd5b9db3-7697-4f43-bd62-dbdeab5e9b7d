\"It stands to reason!" said Lao Tan. "If the Way could be presented,
there is no man who would not present it to his ruler. If the Way could
be offered, there is no man who would not offer it to his parents. If
the Way could be reported, there is no man who would not report it to
his brothers. If the Way could be bequeathed, there is no man who would
not bequeath it to his heirs. But it cannot - and for none other than
the following reason. If there is no host on the inside to receive it,
it will not stay; if there is no mark on the outside to guide it, it
will not go. If what is brought forth from the inside is not received
on the outside, then the sage will not bring it forth. If what is taken
in from the outside is not received by a host on the inside, the sage
will not entrust it."
