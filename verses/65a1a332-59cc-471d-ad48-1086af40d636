I came to the conclusion long ago, after prayerful search and study and
discussion with as many people as I could meet, that all religions were
true and also that all had some error in them, and that whilst I hold by
my own, I should hold others as dear as Hinduism, from which it logically
follows that we should hold all as dear as our nearest kith and kin and
that we should make no distinction between them.
