This Atmâ, which dwells in the heart, is smaller than a grain of rice, smaller
than a grain of barley, smaller than a grain of mustard, smaller than a grain
of millet, smaller than the germ which is in the grain of millet; this Àtmâ,
which dwells in the heart, is also greater than the earth, greater than the
atmosphere, greater than the sky, greater than all the worlds together.

Containing all works, containing all desires, containing all odors, containing
all tastes, encompassing this whole world, the unspeaking, the unconcerned --
this is Âtmâ within the heart, this is Brahma. Into It I shall enter on
departing hence.
