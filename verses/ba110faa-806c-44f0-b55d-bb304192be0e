There is a beginning. There is a not yet beginning to be a beginning.
There is a not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning to be a
beginning. There is being. There is nonbeing. There is a not yet
beginning to be nonbeing. There is a not yet beginning to be a not yet
beginning to be nonbeing. Suddenly there is nonbeing. But I do not
know, when it comes to nonbeing, which is really being and which is
nonbeing. Now I have just said something. But I don't know whether what
I have said has really said something or whether it hasn't said
something.
