Title: By Degrees
---
Awareness of God does not come by degreesï¼š
from timidity to intellectual temerity;
  from guesswork, reluctance, to certainty;
it is not a decision reached at the crossroads of doubt.
It comes when, drifting in the wilderness,
  having gone astray,
we suddenly behold the immutable polar star.
Out of endless anxiety,
out ofdenial and despair,
the soul bursts out in speechless crying.
