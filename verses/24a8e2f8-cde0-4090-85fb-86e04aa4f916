Man's ultimate aim is the realization of God, and all his activities,
social, political, religious, have to be guided by the ultimate aim of
the vision of God. The immediate service of all human beings becomes a
necessary part of the endeavour, simply because the only way to find God
is to see Him in His creation and be one with it. This can only be done
by service of all. I am a part and parcel of the whole, and I cannot find
Him apart from the rest of humanity.
