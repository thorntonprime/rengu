Title: The All of Ever Only Love
---
We name the world
    of things and feelings, of this and
    of that, of yes and of no, of dark
    and of light,
and in all this
    turn from the source of our being
    which has no name we can know
    and is beyond
every feeling
    and cannot be other.than yes,
    and when I give myself to
    the inflow of
me into You
    I find that this origin is the way
    and this way is the end and
    this end is the all of
ever only love.
