Perfection is the attribute of the Almighty, and yet what a great democrat
He is! What an amount of wrong and humbug He suffers on our part! He even
suffers insignificant creatures of His to question His very existence,
though He is in every atom about us, around us and within us. But, He
has reserved to Himself the right of becoming manifest to whomsoever He
chooses. He is a Being without hands and feet and other organs, yet He
can see him to whom He chooses to reveal Himself.
