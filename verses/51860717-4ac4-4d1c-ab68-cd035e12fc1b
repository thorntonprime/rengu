Title: The Sandalwood Tree
---
The sandalwood tree shares its lovely scent with any who come near. God is
 like that.
Does the tree ever think to itself, I am not going to offer my fragrance to
 that man over there because of what he did last night,
or to that woman who neglected her child, or because of what we, we might
 have ever done?
It is not the way of God to hoard. He is simply just there, emanating freely
 what He is, if we wish to grab a handful, or fill the basket in the eye.
Don't hold back, have no reservations, take full advantage of His attributes,
 exploit His nature and that tender part of His soul.
