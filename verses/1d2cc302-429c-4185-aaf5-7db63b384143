He is the greatest democrat the world knows, for He leaves us unfettered
to make our own choice between evil and good. He is the greatest tyrant
ever known, for He often dashes the cup from our lips and under the cover
of free will leaves us a margin so wholly inadequate as to provide only
mirth for Himself at our expense. Therefore it is that Hinduism calls it
all His sport -- lila, or calls it all an illusion -- maya.
