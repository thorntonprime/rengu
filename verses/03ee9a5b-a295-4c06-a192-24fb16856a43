He who would succeed in the study of this Art, should be persevering,
industrious, learned, gentle, good-tempered, a close student, and neither
easily discouraged nor slothful.  ... Above all, let him be honest,
God-fearing, prayerful, and holy. Being thus equipped, he should study Nature,
read the books of genuine Sages, who are neither imposters nor jealous churls,
and study them day and night; let him not be too eager to carry out every idea
practically before he has thoroughly tested it, and found it to be in harmony
not only with the teaching of all the Sages, but also of Nature herself. ...
Nor let him despair though he take many false steps; for the greatest
philosophers have learned most by their mistakes.
