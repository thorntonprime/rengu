1: |
  We are resting.
  Physically quiet,
  Breath and body
  In gentle harmony
  Holding the stillness within.
2: |
  Holding the stillness within,
  Thoughts fit into place.
  No longer spinning,
  They come together;
  No longer disputing,
  Our thoughts
  Are friendly with each other.
  The quality of wholeness
  Replaces
  The discord of the mind.
3: |
  Mind and body
  Together,
  Thoughts and emotions
  Revolving around
  A single center point.
  Varied movements
  Actively churning
  Form a quiet center.
  A quiet center forms
  In their midst.
4: |
  We feel the center of our Self,
  The inner center of our Self,
  It is neither body
  Nor mind
  But a center point
  Not this, not that.
  A single center point,
  The inner center ofthe Sclfi
5: |
  In the midst of activity
  Soft, slow breathing
  Sets a balance.
  An inward stillness
  Becomes present.
  The center point within me
  Establishes itself.
6: |
  For each of us it is so.
  A center point within
  Forms itself.
  A center point is present
  Not in space
  But in our being.
7: |
  A center point within me.
  My whole attention
  At that center point,
  Present there in the stillness,
  In the stillness of the Self.
8: |
  Through this center point
  We move inward,
  Inward and downward
  Through a single straight shaft.
  It is as though we go
  Deep into the earth,
  But within our Self.
  Through the center point within
  We go inward,
  Deeper,
  Deeper inward.
9: |
  My life
  Is like the shaft of a well.
  I go deep into it.
  The life of each of us
  Is a well.
  Its sources are deep,
  But it gives water on the surface.
  Now we go inward,
  Moving through our center point,
  Through our center point,
  Deeply inward to explore
  The infinities of our well.
10: |
  Long enough
  We have been on the surface
  Of our life.
  Now we go inward,
  Moving through our center point
  Inward,
  Into the well of our Self,
  Deeply,
  Further inward
  Into the well of our Self.
11: |
  We move away
  From the surface of things;
  We leave
  The circles of our thoughts,
  Our habits, customs.
  All the shoulds
  And the oughts
  Of our life
  We leave behind.
12: |
  We leave them on the surface
  While we go inward,
  Into the depth of our life
  Moving through the center point
  Into the well of our Self
  As deeply
  As fully
  As freely as we can.
  Through the center point
  Exploring the deep places.
  Exploring the deep places
  In the Silence ... In the Silence.
