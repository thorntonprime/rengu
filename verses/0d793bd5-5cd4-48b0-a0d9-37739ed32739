Tonight in Deaths & Entrances while standing I suddenly knew what witchcraft
is -- in microcosm -- It is the being within each of us -- sometimes the
witch, sometimes the real being of good -- of creative energy -- no matter
in what area or direction of activity. The witches’ sabbath is the anger
we know at times. The sacrament is taken but the wine of life is the blood
of death -- It is the abomination which is partaken of rather than the
essence of life -- when I lose my temper it is like a witches’ sabbath --
the Black Mass -- the world is given over to the powers of darkness && the
rule of the blood -- It is Kali in her terrible aspect -- It is Shiva the
destroyer -- It is Lucifer -- “as proud as Lucifer" -- the obverse of God --

This, too, is what D & E is about -- only I did not know enough to quite
see it through --

All the repentance is of no avail. It is “giving for“ one mood the
other state of consciousness -- doing it quite consciously -- in face of
all temptation to do otherwise & to “ride the broom-stick." Strength
comes from a use of the muscles -- The athletes of God wrestled & grew
strong. They chose, & they acted.

What I do must be done in full sunlight of awareness -- I must learn
a means of changing the mood -- the state of consciousness -- without
doublemindedness or tho‘t of gain.
