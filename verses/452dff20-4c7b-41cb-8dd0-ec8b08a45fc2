The ancients who followed Taoï¼š Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating. Deep
 beyond knowing.
Because they cannot be known, They can only be described. Cautious, like
 crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like respecting one's neighbours.
 Polite, like a guest.
Yielding, Like ice about to melt; Blank, like uncarved wood. Open, like a
 valley. Mixing freely, like muddy water.
Calm the muddy water, It becomes clear. Move the inert, It comes to life.?
Those who sustain Tao Do not wish to be full. Because they do not wish to
 be full They can fade away Without further effort.
