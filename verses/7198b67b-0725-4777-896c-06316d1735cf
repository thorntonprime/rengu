Title: The Earth's Silhouettes
---
What plant can grow if you keep lifting it from the soil?
Let your roots expand unchecked into a vista, a forest, a river, a song,
 or some verse you can hold tenderly.
You need to become quiet for this, as roots work in silence beneath the
 earth’s silhouettes.
Let all your senses extract from me what they can. So mineral-rich I am,
having drawn all a soul ever could from what is above, below and to the side,
 and within us, within us my love.
