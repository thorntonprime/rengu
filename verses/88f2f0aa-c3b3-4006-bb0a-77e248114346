Again, in the essence of the mind there is transcendence, the effort
to step beyond all horizons. From this, of course, it also follows that
the mind violates its own horizon as well; we reflect on our ability to
reflect; we know that we know; we know that we know that we know; we know
that we have been separated, we know of our thrownnesses, we know of the
unattainability of what we strive toward, and we know that we cannot help
but strive toward it; we know what we don't know and what we cannot know --
so that the more radically we step beyond our limitations, the better we know
them, and the better we know them, the more obviously we step beyond them.
