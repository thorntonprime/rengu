When our term of service is ended, when we are divested of our
guardianship of the material world, and freed from the bonds of
mortality, (God) will restore us, cleansed and sanctified, to the
primal condition of that higher part of us which is divine. ... But
those who have lived evil and impious lives are not permitted to
return to heaven. For such men is ordained a shameful transmigration
into bodies of another kind, bodies unworthy to be the abode of holy
mind.
