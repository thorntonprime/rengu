  - Sacrifice-Death=Death=‘Die Before Ye Die'
  - Sacrifice-Death=Death=Only the Dead Know God
By: Eckhart
---
The dead who have died in the Godhead are beyond our ken, like the
dead are who die here to the body. That death is the soul’s eternal
quest. Slain in the three Persons she loses her naught and is hurled
into the Godhead.
