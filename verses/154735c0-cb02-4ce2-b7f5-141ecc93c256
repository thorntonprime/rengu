Title: Haphazard Brilliant Thoughts
Description: July 31
---
There are not many teachers in this world who can give you as much
 enlightenment in one year
as sitting all alone for three days in your closet would do. That means
 no leaving,
so better get a friend to help with a few sandwiches and the chamber pot if
 you ever give it a try.
And no alcohol in there or illegal drugs, books, or pens and paper to write
 down any brilliant thoughts that might haphazardly wander through your head.
Think non-attachment. Aim high for a 360 degree detox. Stop musing for a
 while ... you are who you aren’t.
This 72 hour retreat though, is not recommended if your emotional state has
 ever been under any kind of professional surveillance!
Dear ones, don’t let Hafiz fool you. There is usually, like right now,
 a ruby buried in what I say. Grab it, and don’t let go ... till your
 horizons expand.
