Those who spoke of the Great Way in ancient times could count to five
in the sequence [described above] and pick out "forms and names," or
count to nine and discuss "rewards and punishments." But to jump right
in and talk about "forms and names" is to lack an understanding of the
source; to jump right in and talk about "rewards and punishments" is to
lack an understanding of the beginning. Those who stand the Way on its
head before describing it, who turn it backwards before expounding it,
may be brought to order by others, but how could they be capable of
bringing others to order? Those who jump right in and talk about "forms
and names," "rewards and punishments," have an understanding of the
tools for bringing order, but no understanding of the way to bring
order. They may work for the world, but they are not worthy to make the
world work for them. They are rhetoricians, scholars cramped in one
corner of learning. Rites and laws, weights and measures, the careful
comparison of forms and names - the men of old had all these. They are
the means by which those below serve those above, not the means by
which those above shepherd those below.
