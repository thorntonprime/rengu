Christ did make the babes and ignorant, of a very weak and mean
capacity, knowing and understanding, viz. of poor fishermen,
carpenters, and the like mechanics, he made apostles, and the most
understanding men of all; and also of poor, disrespected, vilified
people, as of women, and simple ones, he made faithful, devout, dear,
godly children, who apprehended in themselves the universal without
any art.

Thus likewise it goes in the philosophic work; the essentiality which
lies disappeared in death, where the Mercury is wholly earthly, cold,
and impotent, does now arise in power, as if the whole being and
essence were become a new life, at which the artist wonders, and
marvels what it is, or how it happens, and yet does also exceedingly
rejoice that he sees the divine power to spring forth before his eyes
in a half dead essence, and that in the curse of God.
