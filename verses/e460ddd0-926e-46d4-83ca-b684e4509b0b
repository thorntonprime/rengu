But it is impossible for us to realize perfect Truth so long as we
are imprisoned in this mortal frame. We can only visualize it in our
imagination. We cannot, through the instrumentality of this ephemeral body,
see face to face Truth which is eternal. That is why in the last resort
we must depend on faith.
