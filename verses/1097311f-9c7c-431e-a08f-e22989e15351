Title: Beyond Any Silence You Have Heard
---
Different trees grow various heights and then perish and evolve into another
  species.

They reach their limbs -- their souls -- a little deeper into incandescence's
  well

and then tell the world by their marvelous appearance what that life is like.

Yes, try to do that before you depart this wondrous place we are visiting;

bring us some good tidings of silence beyond any silence you have already
  heard.
