Once upon a time a lover of secret lore came to an anchorite and asked to be
admitted as a pupil. Then he said to him： My son. your purpose is admirable,
but do you possess equanimity or not? He replied： Indeed, I feel satisfaction
at praise and pain at insult, but I am not revengeful and I bear no grudge.
Then the master said to him： My son.  go back to your home, for as long as
you have no equanimity and can still feel the sting of insult, you have not
attained to the state where you can connect your thoughts with God.
