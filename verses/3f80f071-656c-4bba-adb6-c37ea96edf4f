Even though through the days and years of life, you have piled up much
merit by the practice of the Nembutsu, if at the time of death you
come under the spell of some evil, and at the end give way to an evil
heart, and lose the power of faith in and practice of the Nembutsu, it
means that you lose that birth into the Pure Land immediately after
death. ... This is indeed a most terrible thing to contemplate, and
one which no words can describe.
