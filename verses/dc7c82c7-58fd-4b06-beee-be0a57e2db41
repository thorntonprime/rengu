Title: Love Can Be Kept
---
The truth I love in loving others
cannot be something merely philosophical and abstract.
It must be at the same time supernatural and concrete,
practical and alive.
And I mean these words in no metaphorical sense.

The truth I must love in others is God, alive in others.
I must seek the life of the spirit of God breathing in others.
And I can only discern and follow that mysterious life
by the action of the same Holy Spirit
living and acting in the depths of my own heart.
