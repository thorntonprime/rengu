There is something that can be found in one place. It is a great treasure,
which may be called the fulfillment of existence. The place where this
treasure can be found is the place on which one stands.

Most of us achieve only at rare moments a clear realization of the fact that
they have never tasted the fulfillment of existence, that their life does not
participate in true, fulfilled existence, that, as it were, it passes true
existence by. We nevertheless feel the deficiency at every moment, and in
some measure strive to find -- somewhere -- what we are seeking. Somewhere,
in some province of the world or of the mind, except where we stand, where
we have been set-but it is there and nowhere else that the treasure can be
found. The environment which I feel to be the natural one, the situation
which has been assigned to me as my fate, the things that happen to me
day after day, the things that claim me day after day -- these contain my
essential task and such fulfillment ofexistence as is open to me. It is said
of a certain Talmudic master that the paths of Heaven were as bright to him
as the streets of his native town. Hasidism inverts the order： It is a
greater thing ifthe streets of a man’s native town are as bright to him
as the paths of Heaven. For it is here, where we stand, that we should try
to make shine the light of the hidden divine life.
