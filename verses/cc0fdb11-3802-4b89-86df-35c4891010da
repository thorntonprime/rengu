I'm free in this cave on T'ien-t'aiï¼š
no seeker here will ever find me.
Han Shan's my only friend.
Chewing magic mushrooms,
underneath tall pines,
we chatter back and forth
of ancient times, and new,
sighing to think of all the others,
each on his own way to hell.
Get your heads out, there's still time!
