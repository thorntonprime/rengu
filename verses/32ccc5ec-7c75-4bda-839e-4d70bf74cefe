\"I was pondering what it is that has brought me to this extremity, but
I couldn't find the answer. My father and mother surely wouldn't wish
this poverty on me. Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears
up all without partiality - heaven and earth surely wouldn't single me
out to make me poor. I try to discover who is doing it, but I can't get
the answer. Still, here I am - at the very extreme. It must be fate."
