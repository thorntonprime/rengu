Everything in the universe is subject to change. There’s only one
exception： death always follows life. Isn’t strange that people haven’t
noticed this, that they conduct their lives as though they’re going to live
forever, that death is nothing to worry about? Of course if they really
want to live as long as they obviously expect, they’d better pursue the
Dharma. Life, death, and change itself are transcended in the Dharmakaya.
