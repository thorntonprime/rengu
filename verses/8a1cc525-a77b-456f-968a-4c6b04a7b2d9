Whatever is seen by us in time, thou. Lord God, didst not pre conceive,
as it is. For in the eternity in which thou dost conceive, all temporal
succession coincides in one and the same Eternal Now. So there is nothing past
or future where past and future coincide in the present. ... Thou indeed,
my God, who art thyself Eternity absolutely, art, and speakest (thy Word)
above the now and then.
