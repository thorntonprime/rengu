YOUR LIFE HAS A LIMIT but knowledge has none. If you use what is
limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger. If you
understand this and still strive for knowledge, you will be in danger
for certain! If you do good, stay away from fame. If you do evil, stay
away from punishments. Follow the middle; go by what is constant, and
you can stay in one piece, keep yourself alive, look after your
parents, and live out your years.
