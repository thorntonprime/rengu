It is related that Shibli cast four hundred dinârs into the Tigris. When
asked what he was doing, he replied： ‘Stones are better in the water.’ ‘But
why,’ they said, ‘don’t you give the money to the poor?’ He answered： ‘Glory
to God! what plea can I urge before Him if I remove the veil from my own
heart only to place it on the hearts of my brother Moslems?  It is not
religious to wish them worse than myself.’
