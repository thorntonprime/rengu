She knelt down, thanked Him for His Grace, took her crown from her head and
laid it against the rosy scars of His feet, and begged that she might come near
Him. He took her in His Divine arms and laid His Fatherly hand on her breast
and gazed into her face. Ah!  how she was then kissed! And in that kiss was
raised up to the highest heights above all the choirs of angels.

  Bore no likeness
  Even to the highest wisdom
  Ever known on earth.

There I saw inwardly unheard of things, so my confessor tells me. I am not
expert in writing, but now I fear before God if I keep silent about these
things, and before ignorant people if I speak.
