Ramdas can tell you in all truth and sincerity that there is no Sadhana
easier than the repetition of the Name. It can take you to the highest
spiritual eminence by giving you the all-comprehensive knowledge of God. Sri
Ramakrishna had gone through various Sadhanas for twelve years. Ultimately,
whenever anybody went to him for spiritual advice, he would ask them to take
only the name of God. This is the essence of all Sadhanas.
