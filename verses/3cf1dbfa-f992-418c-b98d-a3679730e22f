Title: That a man shall not take ensample of Saint Martin and of Saint
  Stephen, for to strain his imagination bodily upwards in the time of
  his prayer
---
For that that they say of Saint Martin and of Saint Stephen, although they
saw such things with their bodily eyes, it was shewed but in miracle and in
certifying of thing that was ghostly. For wit they right well that Saint
Martin’s mantle came never on Christ’s own body substantially, for no
need that He had thereto to keep Him from cold： but by miracle and in
likeness for all us that be able to be saved, that be oned to the body of
Christ ghostly. And whoso clotheth a poor man and doth any other good deed
for God’s love bodily or ghostly to any that hath need, sure be they they
do it unto Christ ghostly： and they shall be rewarded as substantially
therefore as they had done it to Christ’s own body. Thus saith Himself in
the gospel. And yet thought He it not enough, but if He affirmed it after by
miracle; and for this cause He shewed Him unto Saint Martin by revelation. All
the revelations that ever saw any man here in bodily likeness in this life,
they have ghostly bemeanings. And I trow that if they unto whom they were
shewed had been so ghostly, or could have conceived their bemeanings ghostly,
that then they had never been shewed bodily. And therefore let us pick off
the rough bark, and feed us off the sweet kernel.

But how? Not as these heretics do, the which be well likened to madmen
having this custom, that ever when they have drunken of a fair cup, cast
it to the wall and break it. Thus should not we do if we will well do. For
we should not so feed us of the fruit, that we should despise the tree;
nor so drink, that we should break the cup when we have drunken. The tree
and the cup I call this visible miracle, and all seemly bodily observances,
that is according and not letting the work of the spirit. The fruit and the
drink I call the ghostly bemeaning of these visible miracles, and of these
seemly bodily observances： as is lifting up of our eyes and our hands unto
heaven. If they be done by stirring of the spirit, then be they well done;
and else be they hypocrisy, and then be they false. If they be true and
contain in them ghostly fruit, why should they then be despised? For men
will kiss the cup for wine is therein.

And what thereof, though our Lord when He ascended to heaven bodily took His
way upwards into the clouds, seen of His mother and His disciples with their
bodily eyes? Should we therefore in our ghostly work ever stare upwards with
our bodily eyes, to look after Him if we may see Him sit bodily in heaven,
or else stand, as Saint Stephen did? Nay, surely He shewed Him not unto
Saint Stephen bodily in heaven, because that He would give us ensample that
we should in our ghostly work look bodily up into heaven if we might see Him
as Saint Stephen did, either standing, or sitting, or else lying. For howso
His body is in heaven -- standing, sitting, or lying -- wots no man. And
it needeth not more to be witted, but that His body is oned with the soul,
without departing. The body and the soul, the which is the manhood, is oned
with the Godhead without departing also. Of His sitting, His standing, His
lying, needeth it not to wit; but that He is there as Him list, and hath
Him in body as most seemly is unto Him for to be. For if He shew Him lying,
or standing, or sitting, by revelation bodily to any creature in this life,
it is done for some ghostly bemeaning： and not for no manner of bodily
bearing that He hath in heaven. See by ensample. By standing is understood
a readiness of helping. And therefore it is said commonly of one friend to
another, when he is in bodily battle： “Bear thee well, fellow, and fight
fast, and give not up the battle over lightly; for I shall stand by thee.”
He meaneth not only bodily standing; for peradventure this battle is on horse
and not on foot, and peradventure it is in going and not standing. But he
meaneth when he saith that he shall stand by him, that he shall be ready to
help him. For this reason it was that our Lord shewed Him bodily in heaven to
Saint Stephen, when he was in his martyrdom： and not to give us ensample
to look up to heaven. As He had said thus to Saint Stephen in person of all
those that suffer persecution for His love： “Lo, Stephen! as verily as I
open this bodily firmament, the which is called heaven, and let thee see My
bodily standing, trust fast that as verily stand I beside thee ghostly by
the might of My Godhead. And I am ready to help thee, and therefore stand
thou stiffly in the faith and suffer boldly the fell buffets of those hard
stones： for I shall crown thee in bliss for thy meed, and not only thee,
but all those that suffer persecution for Me on any manner.” And thus
mayest thou see that these bodily shewings were done by ghostly bemeanings.
