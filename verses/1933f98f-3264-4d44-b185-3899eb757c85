Would wicked men dwell a little more at home, and descend into the
bottom of their own hearts, they should soon find hell opening her
mouth wide upon them, and those secret fires of inward fury and
displeasure breaking out upon them, which might fully inform them of
the estate of true misery, as being a short anticipation of it. But in
this life wicked men for the most part elude their own misery for a
time, and seek to avoid the dreadful sentence of their own
consciences, by a tergiversation and flying from themselves into a
converse with other things, ut nemo in sese tent√¢t descendere; else
they would soon find their own home too hot for them.
