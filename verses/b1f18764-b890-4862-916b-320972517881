Title: I Know the Way You Can Get (2)
---
You might pull out a ruler to measure from every angle in your
darkness

the beautiful dimensions of a heart you once trusted.

I know the way you can get if you have not had a drink from Love's
hands.

That is why all the Great Ones speak of the vital need to keep
remembering God,

so you will come to know and see Him as being so giving and wanting,
just wanting to help.

That is why Hafiz says, "Bring your cup near me, for I am a Sweet Old
Vagabond with an

infinite leaking barrel of Light and Laughter and Truth that the
Beloved has tied to my back.

Dear one, indeed, please bring your heart near me. For all I care
about is quenching your thirst for freedom!

All a sane man can ever care about is giving Love!"
