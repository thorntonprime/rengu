Title: Out to Sea Without Restraints
---
What more do I seek than this silence, this simplicity, this "living together
with wisdom"? For me there is nothing else. Last night, before going to bed,
realized momentarily what solitude really means： when the ropes are cast off
and the skiff is no longer tied to land, but heads out to sea without ties,
without restraints! Not the sea of passion, on the contrary, the sea of purity
and love that is without care, that loves God alone immediately and directly
in Himself as the All (and the seeming Nothing that is all). The unuterable
confusion of those who think that God is a mental object and that to love "God
alone" is to exclude all other objects to concentrate on this one! Fatal. Yet
that is why so many misunderstand the meaning of contemplation and solitude,
and condemn it. But I see too that I no longer have the slightest need
to argue with them. I have nothing to justify and nothing to defend： I
need only defend this vast simple emptiness from my own self, and the rest
is clear. (Through the cold and darkness I hear the Angelus ringing at the
monastery.) The beautiful jeweled shining of honey in the lamplight. Festival!
