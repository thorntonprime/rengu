There are material gains and spiritual gains. To gain the material objects
of its desire, the mind searches the external world. When it seeks
spiritual gains, it turns its attention to the heart.

A person ignores his heart becomes attached to the material world. The
Dharma seeker looks inward and attends to his heart. Thatâ€™s where he wants
to form attachments.
