Title: Let Life Happen to You
---
What should I say about your tendency to doubt your struggle or to
harmonize your inner and outer life? My wish is ever strong that you
find enough patience within you and enough simplicity to have faith.
May you gain more and more trust in what is challenging, and
confidence in the solitude you bear. Let life happen to you. Believe
meï¼š life is in the right in any case.
