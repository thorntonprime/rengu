The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.
It is that by which the good man protects,
And that by which the bad is protected.

Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;
Beautiful deeds can raise a man above others.

Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?

Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are
 appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his
 seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a
 team of four horses.
Why was this way valued of old?
Was it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the
 consequences when one transgressed?

Therefore it is valued by the empire.
