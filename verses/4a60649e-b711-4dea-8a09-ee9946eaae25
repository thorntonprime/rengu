Title: The Bridge Flows, The Water Does Not Flow
By: Zobo Bunga
Commentary: |
  The five characters literally read “bridge How water not flow.“ and Zobo
  has utilized bold and flowing cursive script in his brushwork. However,
  there are three ways in which the meaning ofthe text is supported. First,
  the suppos’ edly umnovable “bridge” is rendered in black ink, while
  the other words are grayer in tonality. Next, the first three characters
  join one another with com tinuous brushstrokes, while the final “not”
  and “How” each stand separate and alone. Finally, although the final
  character is the same as the second and re sembles it closely in shape,
  there is more negative space within it and outside it, and it no longer
  emphasizes the dramatic use of" flying white" where the paper shines through
  strokes of the brush. In these ways Zobo has been able to emphasize the
  meaning of the Zen phrase through strictly artistic means.
