\"I received life because the time had come; I will lose it because the
order of things passes on. Be content with this time and dwell in this
order and then neither sorrow nor joy can touch you. In ancient times
this was called the 'freeing of the bound.' There are those who cannot
free themselves, because they are bound by things. But nothing can ever
win against Heaven - that's the way it's always been. What would I have
to resent?"
