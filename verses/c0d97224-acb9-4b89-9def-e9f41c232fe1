\'Where did you learn this from?’ asked Nanpo Tsek'uei.

'I learned it from the Son of Ink.’ replied Nii Yü. ‘and the Son
of Ink learned it from the Grandson of Learning, the Grandson of Learning
from Understanding, and Understanding from Insight. Insight learned it from
Practice. Practice from Song, and Song from Silence, Silence from the Void,
and the Void learned it from the Seeming Beginning.’
