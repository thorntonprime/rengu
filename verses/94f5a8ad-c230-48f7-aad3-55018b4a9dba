Humility, unostentatiousness, non-injuring, forgiveness, simplicity, service
to the Guru, purity, steadfastness, self-control;

Renunciation of sense-objects as well as absence of egoism, realization of
the evils of birth, death, old age, disease, pain;

Non-attachment, non-identification of self with son, wife, home and the rest;
equalmindedness in beneficial and non-beneficial happenings;

One-pointed and unwavering devotion to Me, resort to secluded places,
distaste for assemblies;

Constant devotion to spiritual knowledge, realization of the essence of Truth,
this is declared to be wisdom; what is opposed to this is ignorance.

I shall declare now that which is to be known, by knowing which one attains
immortality. The Supreme Brahman is beginningless; It is said to be neither
Sat (existence) nor Asat (non-existence).

With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere and
with ears everywhere in the universe, That alone exists enveloping all.

It shines through the functions of all the senses, and yet It is without
senses; unattached, yet It sustains all; devoid of Gunas, yet It is the
experiencer of Gunas.

It exists within and without all beings; It is unmoving as well as moving,
incom- prehensible because of Its subtlety; It is far and also near.

Indivisible, yet It exists as if divided in beings; It is to be known as
the Sustainer of beings; It destroys and also generates.

It is the Light of lights and is said to be beyond darkness. It is knowledge,
the One to be known, and the Goal of knowledge, dwelling in the hearts of all.
