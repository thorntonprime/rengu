It's been a long time since I passed through this
 place.
Today, I'm here again, after seventy years.
Of those who wandered by back then,
most lie among the grave mounds.
Me, my head is long since white,
but I still hold on
to my little slice of cloudy mountain.
I have a message for those who'll come afterï¼š
You have to read
the words of the ancients.
