It is the unlearned who are saved rather than those whose ego has not subsided
despite their learning. The unlearned are saved from the unrelenting grip of
self-infatuation, from the malady of a myriad whirling thoughts, from the
endless pursuit of (mental) wealth; it is not from one ill alone that they are
saved.
