Title: How Many Times Have You Felt Like a Corpse?
---
How many times have you felt like a corpse and then came back and told a
 good joke, that made us all laugh?
And did you ever swear off dancing and then there you were one day, scooting
 about again?
And how many times has your soul felt empty and then maybe ... a temple for
 all near you became?
And what of your rare moments when some kind of eff ulgent wedlock was there,
 with all in your ken?
Bring those, anything you have cherished, to the forefront of your mindâ€™s
 view, where they belong as a testament to your destiny.
Some pendulum, which you bought a ticket on, rocks this way and that. You
 can get off. Become more centered.
