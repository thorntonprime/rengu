Life and death are fated - constant as the succession of dark and dawn,
a matter of Heaven. There are some things which man can do nothing
about - all are a matter of the nature of creatures. If a man is
willing to regard Heaven as a father and to love it, then how much more
should he be willing to do for that which is even greater!  If he is
willing to regard the ruler as superior to himself and to die for him,
then how much more should he be willing to do for the Truth!
