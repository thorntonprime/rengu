For in the past, we were made of mind, we fed on rapture, self-luminous, we
traversed the air in abiding loveliness; long long the period we so remained.
For us sooner or later, after a long long while the savoury earth had arisen
over the waters. Colour it had, and odour and taste. We set to work to make
the earth into lumps, and feast on it. As we did so our self-luminance
vanished away. When it was gone, moon and sun became manifest, star-shapes
and constellations, night and day, the months and half-months, the seasons
and the years.
