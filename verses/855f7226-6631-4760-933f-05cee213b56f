Title: Longya Passes The Board
---
Raised：

Longya asked Cuiwei, "So, what is the meaning of the ancestral fo
under's coming from the West?"
Wei said, "Come, pass over the meditation board and give it to me
."
Ya passed over the meditation board to give it to Cuiwei. Wei rec
eived it and then was able to hit him.
Ya said, "If you hit, then I'll allow the hit; essentially, howev
er it is not the meaning of the ancestral founder's coming from the west."
Ya also asked Linji, "So, what is the meaning of the ancestral fo
under's coming from the West?"
Ji said, "Come, pass over the rush-ball (sitting cushion) and giv
e it to me."
Ya fetched the rush-ball and passed it over to give to Linji. Ji
received it and was able to then hit him.
Ya said, "If you hit, then I'll allow the hit; essentially, howev
er it is not the meaning of the ancestral founder's coming from the west."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

Underneath Dragon Tooth Mountain the dragon is eyeless.
When has stagnant water roused the ancient wind?
If you are not able to use the meditation board and the rush-ball cushion,
You should just part from them and give them over to Mister Black.

[Xuedou's Second] Ode says：

This old fellow even is not able to completely exhaust it and returns to
complet
e the first ode.
Mr. Black handed over likewise. What did he rely on?
Stop with the sitting and leaning and you will carry on the ancestor's
lamp.
Adequate for replying： The returning evening clouds have not combined;
The distant mountains are limitless layers and layers of blue.
