Wheelwright P'ien said, "I look at it from the point of view of my own
work. When I chisel a wheel, if the blows of the mallet are too gentle,
the chisel slides and won't take hold. But if they're too hard, it
bites in and won't budge. Not too gentle, not too hard - you can get it
in your hand and feel it in your mind. You can't put it into words, and
yet there's a knack to it somehow. I can't teach it to my son, and he
can't learn it from me. So I've gone along for seventy years and at my
age I'm still chiseling wheels. When the men of old died, they took
with them the things that couldn't be handed down. So what you are
reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of
old."
