Title: Harsh Evidence
Description: August 29
---
What sort of person says that he or she
wants to be polished and pure,
then complains about being handled roughly?

Love is a lawsuit
where harsh evidence must be brought in.
To settle the case,
the judge must hear details.

You have heard that every buried treasure
has a snake guarding it.

Kiss the snake to discover the treasure.
