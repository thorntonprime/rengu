Ryokan devoted his life to the study of Zen. One day he heard
that his nephew, despite the admonitions of relatives, was
spending his money on a courtesan. Inasmuch as the nephew had
taken Ryokan's place in managing the family estate and the
property was in danger of being dissipated, the relatives asked
Ryokan to do something about it.

Ryokan had to travel a long way to visit his nephew, whom he had
not seen for many years. The nephew seemed pleased to meet his
uncle again and invited him to remain overnight.

All night Ryokan sat in meditation. As he was departing in the
morning he said to the young man： "I must be getting old, my
hand shakes so. Will you help me tie the string of my straw
sandal?"

The nephew helped him willingly. "Thank you," finished Ryokan,
"you see, a man becomes older and feebler day by day. Take good
care of yourself." Then Ryokan left, never mentioning a word
about the courtesan or the complaints of the relatives. But,
from that morning on, the dissipations of the nephew ended.
