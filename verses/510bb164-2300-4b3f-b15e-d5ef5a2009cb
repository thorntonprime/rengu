The source rests with the superior, the trivia with the inferior; the
essential resides in the ruler, the details in his ministers. The
blandishments of the three armies and the five weapons - these are the
trivia of Virtue. The doling out of rewards and punishments, benefit
and loss, the five penalties - these are the trivia of public
instruction. Rites and laws, weights, measures, the careful comparison
of forms and names - these are the trivia of good government. The
tones of bell and drum, the posturings of feather and tassel - these
are the trivia of music. Lamentation and coarse garments, the mourning
periods of varying lengths - these are the trivia of grief. These five
trivia must wait for the movement of pure spirit, for the vitality of
the mind's art before they can command respect. The study of such
trivia was known to antiquity but the men of old gave them no
precedence.
