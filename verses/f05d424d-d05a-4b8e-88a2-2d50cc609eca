In the Dharma’s perfect stillness, the heart perceives and understands
everything. There are no words for the tongue to speak, no sound for the
ear to hear, no sights for the eye to see. Those who live in the Dharma
live in their hearts. It’s strange that though their bodies may be
decaying, their breath is always like a fragrant cool breeze. How wonderful
it is to be near them!
