If you desire true pleasures and unceasing joys, you must put off your
unclean garment, cast off the burden of your body, and guard against things
repugnant to your (incorporeal) substance; and having done so, turn to the
world of true pleasures and unceasing joys, clothe yourself in garments
congruous with your true being, and surround yourself with forms appropriate
to your own substance, forms everlasting and unchanging, -- those forms, of
which copies and semblances were seen by you while you were yet in the world
of things that come to be and cease to be.
