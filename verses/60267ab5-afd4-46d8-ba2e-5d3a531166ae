\‘How mournest thou not for thine own sons, when Death, the Bleeder,
has pierced them with his lancet?

Since the evidence of pity is tears in the eyes, why are thine eyes
without moisture and tearless?’

The Shaykh turned towards his wife and said to her, ‘Old woman, verily
the season of December is not like Tamûz (July).

Whether they all are dead or living, when are they absent and hid from
the eye of the heart?

Inasmuch as I see them distinct before me, for what reason should I
rend my face as thou doest?

Although they are outside of Time’s revolution, they are with me and
playing around me.

Weeping is caused by severance or by parting; I am united with my dear
ones and embracing them.

Other people see them in sleep; I see them plainly in my waking state.

I hide myself for a moment from this world, I shake the leaves of
sense-perception from the tree.’
