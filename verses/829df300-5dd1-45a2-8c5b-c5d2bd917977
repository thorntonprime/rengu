Title: Enduring Pain
---
From youth until old age Rabbi Yitzhak Eisik suffered from an ailment which
was known to involve very great pain. His physician once asked him how he
managed to endure such pain without complaining or groaning. He replied：
“You would understand that readily enough if you thought of the pain as
scrubbing and soaking the soul in a strong solution. Since this is so, one
cannot do otherwise than accept such pain with love and not grumble. After
a time, one gains the strength to endure the present pain. It is always
only the question of a moment, for the pain which has passed is no longer
present, and who would be so foolish as to concern himselfwith future pain!"
