There are
So many positions of
Loveï¼š

Each curve on a branch,

The thousand different ways
Your eyes can embrace us,

The infinite shapes your
Mind can draw,

The spring
Orchestra of scents,

The currents of light combusting
Like passionate lips,

The revolution of Existence's skirt
Whose folds contain other worlds,

Your every sigh that falls against
His inconceivable
Omnipresent
Body.
