Be still and cool in thy own mind and spirit from thine own thoughts,
and then thou wilt feel the principle of God
to turn thy mind to the Lord God,
whereby thou wilt receive his stength and power
from whence life comes,
to allay all tempests, against blusterings and storms.
That is it which moulds up into patience,
into innocency, into soberness, into stillness,
into stayedness, into quietness,
up to God, with his power.

THerefore be still a while from thy own thoughts,
searching, seeking, desires, and imaginations,
and be stayed in the principle of God in thee,
to stay thy mind upon God, up to God;
and thou wilt find strength from him
and find him to be a present help in time of trouble,
in need, and to be a God at hand.
And it will keep the humble being come to the principle of God,
which hath been transgressed;
which humble, God will teach in his way, which is peace;
and such he doith exalt.
And now as the principle of God in the hath been transgressed,
come to it, to keep thy mind down low, up to the Lord God;
and deny thyself.
And from thy own will, that is, the earthly,
thou must be kept.
Then thou wilt feel the power of God,
that will bring nature into his course,
and to see the glory of the first body.
And there the wisdom of God will be received,
which is Christ, by which all things were made and created,
in wisdom to be preserved and ordered to God's glory.
There thou wilt come to receive and feel the physician of value,
which clothes people in their right mind,
whereby they may serve God and do his will.
