Holding onto joy and sorrow,
love and hate,
passivity and anger,
lead one away from virtue and the Tao.
A heart that takes no notice
of opposites will remain unchanging,
and in perfect peace.
Do not relate to the duality
of the external world.
Avoid negative states of mind
if you wish to remain pure and unblemished.
