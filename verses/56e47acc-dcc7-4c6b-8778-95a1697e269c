For many who have experienced it, this vision of a changeless reality
has been so powerful and so self-evidently true that they have concluded
that the changing world ofeveryday experience is somehow less real. The
impermanence of things in this world is an appearance or reflection or
illusion. Underlying everything is the true reality which neither comes
into being nor passes away.
