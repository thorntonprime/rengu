This holy god, the lord of all the gods, Amen-Râ, the lord of the throne
of the two lands, the governor of Àpt; the holy soul who came into being
in the beginning; the great god who liveth by Maât; the first divine matter
which gave birth unto subsequent divine matter! the being through whom every
god hath existence; the One One who hath made everything which hath come
into existence since primeval times when the world was created; the being
whose births are hidden, whose evolutions are manifold, and whose growths are
unknown; the holy Form, beloved, terrible, and mighty in his risings; the lord
of wealth, the power, Khepera who createth every evolution of his existence,
except whom at the beginning none other existed; ... who having made himself
(to be seen, caused) all men to live; who saileth over the celestial regions
and faileth not; ... who though an old man shineth in the form of one that
is young; ... who made the heavens and the earth by his will; the greatest
of the great, the mightiest of the mighty. ...
