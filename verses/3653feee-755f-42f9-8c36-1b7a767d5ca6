Since the devil never sleeps, it happened that one night a big fight got
under way in one of the many gambling houses which, contrary to the local
ordinances and decrees, abounded in Quintu Mayu Street. A gambler inexperienced
at sleight of hand, who wasn’t slick enough to get away with the trick,
had let three dice fall on a bet with high stakes, when some grouch drew a
knife and nailed his hand to the table.
