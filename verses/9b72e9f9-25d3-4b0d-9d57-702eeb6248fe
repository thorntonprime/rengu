  - Union-Identity=Realization And Identity=The Spiritual Tincture
By: Fran√ßois Louis de Blois

In truth, that which puts off the human and puts on the divine is transformed
into God, the same as iron in the fire takes on the appearance of the fire
and is changed into it. But the essence of the soul thus deified subsists,
just as the red iron does not cease to be iron. Thus the soul which before
was cold is now ardent, which before was dark is now shining, which before
was hard is now mollified; all is coloured with God, because the divine
essence is infused in its being, all is consumed in the fire of divine love,
and all is melted and passed into God, and united to him without mode,
and become one single spirit with him; just as gold and bronze are melted
together into an ingot of metal.
