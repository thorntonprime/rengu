Mantra is a combination of words that stands for the Supreme Reality. It
is so set that by the utterance of it, a rhythmic sound is produced which
has a marvellous effect on both the mental and the physical system. The
sound of the Mantra produces mental equilibrium and physical harmony. It
tunes the entire human being w'ith the eternal music of the Divine. ...
bringing the soul in direct contact with the in-dwelling and all-pervading
Reality. ... One great advantage of Mantra Yoga over other methods is that
it is a discipline which is at once self-sufficient and independent. Truly,
one who keeps the Mantra always on his lips can attain to the infinite power,
wisdom, love and vision of God.
