A man of principle is reverent in everything and as much as in anything else
reverences his own self. That self of his is a branch of the tree of his
parents. How could he not reverence it? To be unable to reverence oneself is an
injury to one’s parents, and that is an injury to one’s very root. Let the root
be injured and the branches along with it will die.

These three (facts) are a symbol of life in the community. ‘Self includes other
selves, ‘son’ includes other men’s sons, ‘wife’ includes other men’s wives. Let
a man of principle put these three things into practice, and he will reach out
to the whole of the Great Society. They constitute the Way of a great king,
and it is along this line that states and families will become docile.
