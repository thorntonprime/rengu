Title: The Turning Of Heaven

\"The white fish hawk has only to stare unblinking at its mate for
fertilization to occur. With insects, the male cries on the wind above,
the female cries on the wind below, and there is fertilization. The
creature called the lei is both male and female and so it can fertilize
itself. Inborn nature cannot be changed, fate cannot be altered, time
cannot be stopped, the Way cannot be obstructed. Get hold of the Way
and there's nothing that can't be done; lose it and there's nothing
that can be done."
