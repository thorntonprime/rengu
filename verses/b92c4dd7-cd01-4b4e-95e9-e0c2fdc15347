For all sin is fulfilled in three ways, viz., by suggestion, by delight, and
by consent. Suggestion is occasioned by the Devil, delight is from the
flesh, and consent from the mind. For the serpent suggested the first
offence, and Eve, as flesh, was delighted with it, but Adam consented, as the
spirit, or mind.
