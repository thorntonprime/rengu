At morning-tide a moon appeared in the sky.
And descended from the sky and gazed on me.
Like a falcon which snatches a bird at the time of hunting,
That moon snatched me up and coursed over the sky.
When I looked at myself, I saw myself no more.
Because in that moon my body became by grace even as soul.
When I travelled in soul, I saw nought save the moon.
Till the secret of the eternal Theophany was all revealed.
The nine spheres of heaven were all merged in that moon.
The vessel of my being was completely hidden in the sea. ...
Without the power imperial of Shamsu ’l-Haqq of Tabriz
One could neither behold the moon nor become the sea.
