\"I used to think there was only one real man in the world," said
Tzu-kung. "I didn't know there was this other one. I have heard
Confucius say that in affairs you aim for what is right, and in
undertakings you aim for success. To spend little effort and achieve
big results - that is the Way of the sage. Now it seems that this isn't
so. He who holds fast to the Way is complete in Virtue; being complete
in Virtue, he is complete in body; being complete in body, he is
complete in spirit; and to be complete in spirit is the Way of the
sage. He is content to live among the people, to walk by their side,
and never know where he is going. Witless, his purity is complete.
Achievement, profit, machines, skill - they have no place in this man's
mind! A man like this will not go where he has no will to go, will not
do what he has no mind to do. Though the world might praise him and say
he had really found something, he would look unconcerned and never turn
his head; though the world might condemn him and say he had lost
something, he would look serene and pay no heed. The praise and blame
of the world are no loss or gain to him. He may be called a man of
Complete Virtue. I - I am a man of the wind-blown waves."
