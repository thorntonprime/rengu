These days you might meet a man,
heart missing, dumb as a plank ...
When he talks, nothing you can understand
 comes out
of his mouth, except when he says, "I don't care."
Ask him the Way, "There ain't no way";
ask about the Buddha, he just says don't ask.
Question him carefully, get into detail;
Deep, vast, and empty is this slough of despond ...
