Sometimes we may find that our partner continues to seek satisfaction in ways
that we cannot live with. Nevertheless, when we decide to go our own way we
still have a choice as to how we separate. We can separate with bad feelings,
blaming the otherâ€™s faults and unacceptable behavior. Or we can separate with
forgiveness, love and understanding.
