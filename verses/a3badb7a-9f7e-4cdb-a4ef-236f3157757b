There is a big difference between a scholar and a holy man. The mind of a mere
scholar is fixed on ‘woman and gold’, but the sâdhu’s mind is on the Lotus Feet
of Hari. A scholar says one thing and does another. But it is quite a different
matter with a sâdhu. The words and actions of a man who has given his mind to
the Lotus Feet of God are altogether different.
