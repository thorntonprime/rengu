The world is an illusion. Why is it unreal? Because none of the knowledge is
going to remain permanent, as real knowledge. I had a number of identities; I
was a child, I was a boy, I was a teenager, I was a middle-aged man, I was an
old man. Like other identities I thought would remain constant, they never
remained so. Finally, I became very old. ... So which identity remained honest
with me?
