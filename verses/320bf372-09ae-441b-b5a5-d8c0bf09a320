He, who with a clear eye distinguisheth the curious and close workings of the
will, may find all its motions or affections to be the same love in various
postures, as it rests with sweetest complacency, in the embraces of the beloved
Beauty, or faints under a dispair of fruition, or an irresistable opposition in
its prosecutions; as it sails on smooth Seas, with soft and prosperous gales to
its haven in its eye; or wrestles with tempests of Waves and Winds, with
chearful courage raising it self to surmount them. As the colours of the
Rainbow are the same light variously reflected from the Sun, and variously
falling upon the watry Cloud; so are all the motions of the Will the same Love,
raised from the same good, beautifully shining forth, and reflecting it self
variously upon the Soul in different postures of presence or absence, of doubt,
difficulty, impossibility in the attainment, or facility and assurance of
fruition.
