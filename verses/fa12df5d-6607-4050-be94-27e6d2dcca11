The perfect man is a spiritual being. Were the ocean itself scorched up,
he would not feel hot. Were the Milky Way frozen hard, he would not feel
cold. Were the mountains to be riven with thunder, and the great deep to
be thrown up by storm, he would not tremble. In such case, he would mount
upon the clouds of heaven, and driving the sun and the moon before him,
would pass beyond the limits of this external world, where death and life
have no more victory over man; -- how much less what is bad for him?
