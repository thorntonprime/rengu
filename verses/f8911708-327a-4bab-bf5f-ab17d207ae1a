Title: Your Breath Upon Me
---
Those precious words of hope that entered this world from our souls,

heaven saw them. They were not allowed to die. They were too giving
and beautiful.

Love is not a singular event in the luminous dome or upon this radiant
earth

that can rise or fall like a comet and is then never seen again ... or
rarely talked about.

For when a heart is most in need, we will come back. We will caress
any face that turns in our direction. We will want them to join us.
Join us!

All the promises of God shall come true, as they did for me.

Soft whispers and laughs often contain more truth than anything the
world might call -- serious, important or real.

Having said so much, I should be quiet and see how close you always
are.

But O, look what just happened! Your breath upon me now makes me sing
one more timeï¼š

These exquisite words of hope and giving heaven spoke though our
sublime union -- will never be allowed to die.
