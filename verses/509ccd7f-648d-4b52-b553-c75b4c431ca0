You will rise into the air, if you break and become dust.
If you break not, He who moulded you will break you. ...
O friend, if you reach perfection in our assembly,
Your seat will be the throne, you will gain your desire in all things.
But if you stay many years more in this earth,
You will pass from place to place, you will be as the dice in
  backgammon.
