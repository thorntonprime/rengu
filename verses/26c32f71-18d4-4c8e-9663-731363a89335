Faith is not a delicate flower which would wither under the slightest
stormy weather, Faith is like the Himalaya mountains which cannot possibly
change. No storm can possibly remove the Himalaya mountains from their
foundation. ... And I want every one of you to cultivat that faith in God
and religion.
