I live in a village in the countryside,
without a father or a mother.
With no name, no rank in my clan.
Some people will call me any old name.
Some people call me another.
No one is my teacherï¼š
I'm just a poor low creature like many another.
But I know myself. I'm real,
and my heart is the Diamond.
