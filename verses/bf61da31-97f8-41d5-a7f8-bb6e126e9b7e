Come down, I’m terrified.
Why do you dance so high on that bough?
Hold tight to that limb and carefully, gently come down;
the leaves are going to brush your lotus-bud lips.

The half moon hung on the willow branches smiles faintly in reply：
“It’s not that I don’t want to come down, but, as you know,
I am nim to everyone. I don’t want to refuse your fragrant call."

Without even a blade of grass, I clutched my naked shame,
stole quickly into bed and closed my eyes.
The half moon walked softly over,
hid outside my window, and looked into my eyes.
My shamed heart suddenly shuddered with fright.
