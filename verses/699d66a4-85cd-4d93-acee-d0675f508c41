Title: How these young presumptuous disciples misunderstand this word
  “in,” and of the deceits that follow thereon
---
And on this manner is this madness wrought that I speak of. They read and
hear well said that they should leave outward working with their wits,
and work inwards： and because that they know not which is inward working,
therefore they work wrong. For they turn their bodily wits inwards to their
body against the course of nature; and strain them, as they would see inwards
with their bodily eyes and hear inwards with their ears, and so forth of all
their wits, smelling, tasting, and feeling inwards. And thus they reverse
them against the course of nature, and with this curiosity they travail their
imagination so indiscreetly, that at the last they turn their brain in their
heads, and then as fast the devil hath power for to feign some false light or
sounds, sweet smells in their noses, wonderful tastes in their mouths; and
many quaint heats and burnings in their bodily breasts or in their bowels,
in their backs and in their reins and in their members.

And yet in this fantasy them think that they have a restful remembrance
of their God without any letting of vain thoughts; and surely so have they
in manner, for they be so filled in falsehood that vanity may not provoke
them. And why? Because he, that same fiend that should minister vain thoughts
to them an they were in good way -- he, that same, is the chief worker of
this work. And wit thou right well, that him list not to let himself. The
remembrance of God will he not put from them, for fear that he should be
had in suspect.
