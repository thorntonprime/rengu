The very being of God, if ‘being’ can be ascribed to God, is the Beautiful and
the Good.  ... All things which the eye can see are mere phantoms, and
unsubstantial outlines; but the things which the eye cannot see are the
realities, and above all, the ideal form of the Beautiful and the Good. ... If
you are able to apprehend God, then you will apprehend the Beautiful and the
Good. ... If you seek knowledge of God, you are also seeking knowledge of the
Beautiful. For there is one road alone that leads to the Beautiful, and that is
piety joined with knowledge of God.
