Why is the ocean great?
It lies below all waters.
It calls a million streams its own.

To receive high honor,
posture yourself below others.
To lead others,
posture yourself behind them.

The person of integrity
comes before others without offending,
stands above others without oppressing.
All under heaven ever yield to him.
Because he contends with no one,
no one can contend with him.
