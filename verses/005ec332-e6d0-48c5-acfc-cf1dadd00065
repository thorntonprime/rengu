  St Augustine tells us (C/v. Dei. XVIII. xlii) that Eleazar the high priest
  at Ptolemy's bidding sent six scribes from every tribe to translate the Old
  Testament from Hebrew into Greek. 'Their translation do we now usually call
  the Septuagint. The report of their divine concord therein is admirableï¼š
  for Ptolemy having (to try their faith) made each one translate by himself,
  there was not one word of difference between them, either in sense or order,
  but all was one, as if only one had done it all, because indeed there was
  but one spirit in them all.'
