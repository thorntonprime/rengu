The intricate maze of different schools of philosophy claim to clarify matters
and reveal the Truth. But they, in fact, create confusions where there need be
no confusion. To understand anything, there must first be the person who
understands, that is the Self. Why worry about other things? Why not remain
yourself and be in peace? ... Fortunate is he who does not entangle himself in
the labyrinths of philosophy but goes straight to the source, the Atman from
which all have sprung.
