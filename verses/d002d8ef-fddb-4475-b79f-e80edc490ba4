Title: God in the Stew
---
Is there a human mouth
that does not give out soul-sound?

Is there love, a drawing-together
of any kind, that is not sacred?

Every natural dog
sniffs God in the stew.

Look inside your mind.
Do you hear the crowd gathering?
Help coming, every second.
Still you cover your eyes with mud.

Wash your face.
Anyone who steps into an orchard,
walks inside the orchard keeper.

Millions of love-tents bloom on the plain.
A star in your chest says,
None of this is outside you.

Close your lips and let the maker of mouths
talk, the one who says, things.
