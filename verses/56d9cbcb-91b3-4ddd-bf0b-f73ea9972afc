There is something formed of chaos,
Born before heaven and earth.
Silent and void, it is not renewed,
It goes on forever without failing
It can be seen as the World-Mother.
I don’t know its name.
So I have to call it the Way.
I have to label it as ‘the great’.
Being great implies a distancing
Distancing implies being far-off,
Being far-off implies returning.
So the Way is great： heaven is great：
Earth is great： the ruler is great.
Within the realm four things are great,
And the ruler is one.
The ruler reflects the earth
Earth reflects the heavens
The heavens reflect the Way
The Way reflects what is.
