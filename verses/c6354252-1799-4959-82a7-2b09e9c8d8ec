Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
\"But waiting for one shifting voice [to pass judgment on] another is
the same as waiting for none of them. Harmonize them all with the
Heavenly Equality, leave them to their endless changes, and so live out
your years. What do I mean by harmonizing them with the Heavenly
Equality? Right is not right; so is not so. If right were really right,
it would differ so clearly from not right that there would be no need
for argument. If so were really so, it would differ so clearly from not
so that there would be no need for argument. Forget the years; forget
distinctions. Leap into the boundless and make it your home!"
