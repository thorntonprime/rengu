He regarded penalties as the body, rites as the wings, wisdom as what
is timely, virtue as what is reasonable. Because he regarded penalties
as the body, he was benign in his killing. Because he regarded rites as
the wings, he got along in the world. Because he regarded wisdom as
what is timely, there were things that he could not keep from doing.
Because he regarded virtue as what is reasonable, he was like a man
with two feet who gets to the top of the hill. And yet people really
believed that he worked hard to get there.
