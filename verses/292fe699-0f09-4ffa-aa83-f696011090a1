At last we have now been brought face to face with Amida and his Original Vow,
and are like men longing to cross a stream who have found a ferry. As, however,
we reflect upon the passing of the days and nights, and how quickly we are
drawing near to the land of shadows, we must make haste and seek deliverance
with all our hearts, and, forsaking everything else, earnestly lift up our
voices and invoke the sacred name, otherwise our golden opportunity will
have passed and nothing be left us but remorse.
