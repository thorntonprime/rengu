Title: Things Intimate and Indifferent
---
For our ancestors, a house, a fountain, even clothing, a coat, was much more
intimate. Each thing, almost, was a vessel in which what was human found and
defined itself.

Now, from America, empty, indifferent things sweep in -- pretend things,
life-traps. ... A house, in the American sense, an American apple, a grapevine,
bears no relation to the hope and contemplation with which our ancestors
informed and beheld them.
