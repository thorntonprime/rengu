We have not realized religion in its perfection, even as we have not realized
God. Religion of our conception, being thus imperfect, is always subject to a
process of evolution and re-interpretation. Progress towards Truth, towards
God, is possible only because of such evolution. And if all faiths outlined
by men are imperfect, the question of comparative merit does not arise.
