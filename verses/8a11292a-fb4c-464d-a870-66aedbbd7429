All the hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets were sent to preach one
word. They bade the people say ‘Allâh’ and devote themselves to Him. Those
who heard this word with the ear alone, let it go out by the other ear; but
those who heard it with their souls imprinted it on their souls and repeated
it until it penetrated their hearts and souls, and their whole being became
this word. They were made independent of the pronunciation of the word,
they were released from the sound and the letters. Having understood the
spiritual meaning of this word, they became so absorbed in it that they were
no more conscious of their own non-existence.
