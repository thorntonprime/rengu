A monk asked Zhaozhou, "'The Far-reaching Way is without
difficulty, only rejecting picking and choosing.' For people of these
times, is this a hackneyed phrase run into the ground or not?

Zhao said, "I previously had a person ask me, and frankly I gained five
years and a slice of carelessness did not befall."
