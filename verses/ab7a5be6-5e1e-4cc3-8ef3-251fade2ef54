Danxia asked a monk, "From what place have you come?"

The monk said, "I come from down the mountain."

Xia said, "Have you finished eating the cooked rice or
not?"

The monk said, "I've finished eating the cooked rice."

Xia said, "Did the person at the bottom who came with
the cooked rice to give to you to eat also possess eyes?"

The monk was speechless.

Changqing asked Baofu, "As the person, who gives the
cooked rice to eat, announces the benevolence of having a share, how
does [that one] not possess eyes?"

Fu said, "The one who gives and the one who receives are
both two blind fellows."

Changqing said "Having come to use up all their
opportunities, they still become blind don't they?"

Fu said, "Are you saying we're getting blind?"


Using up the opportunities is not becoming blind.

By laying a hand on the ox's head to eat the grass,

All of the 28 and the six founding masters,

Came to uphold the precious vessel and complete fording across errors.

Fording across the depths of errors,

There is no place to seek.

Heaven (Devas) above and people are in the same in between space
sinking on the shore.

A workshop.

A wink.
