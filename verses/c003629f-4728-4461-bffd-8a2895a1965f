Asceticism is for the common run of people, since it consists in making the
concupiscent appetite abstain from pleasures, in renouncing the temptation to
return again to that from which one is separated, in dropping the search for
what one has lost, in depriving oneself of superfluous desires, in thwarting
the goad of the passions, in neglecting all which does not concern the soul.
But this is an imperfection as regards the path of the elect, for it
presupposes an importance attached to the things of this world, an abstention
from their use, an outward mortification in depriving oneself of things here,
while inwardly an attachment is felt for them.

To make an issue of the world amounts to turning thyself toward thyselfï¼š it
is to pass thy time struggling with thyself; it is to take account of thy
feelings and to remain with thyself against thy concupiscence. ...

In all truth, asceticism is the ardent aspiration of the heart towards Him
alone; it is to place in Him the aspirations and desires of the soul; to be
preoccupied uniquely with Him, without any other preoccupation, in order that
He (to whom be praise!) may remove from thee the mass of these causes.
