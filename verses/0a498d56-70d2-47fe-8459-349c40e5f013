    Title: Sixth Duino Elegy
Title: Fig Tree
---
Fig tree, for how long now have I found meaning
in the way you almost forget to bloom
and drive without drama your pure mystery
into the young determined fruit.
Like a fountain's channel your curving branches
force the sap downward and up again; look, it springs
straight from sleep into its sweetest achievement --
like the god entering a swan. ...
