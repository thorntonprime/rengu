Title: Talking about Power
Commentary: |
  A vast, dense argument in a minumum of words, this poem lays out the Taoist
  values in steeply descending order： the Way and its power; goodness (humane
  feeling); righteousness (morality); and-a very distant last-obedience (law
  and order). The word I render as “opinion” can be read as “knowing
  too soon”： the mind obeying orders, judging before the evidence is in,
  closed to fruitful perception and learning.

Great power, not clinging to power,
has true power.
Lesser power, clinging to power,
lacks true power.
Great power, doing nothing,
has nothing to do.
Lesser power, doing nothing,
has an end in view.

The good the truly good do
has no end in view.
The right the very righteous do
has an end in view.
And those who act in true obedience to law
roll up their sleeves
and make the disobedient obey.

So： when we lose the Way we find power;
losing power we find goodness;
losing goodness we find righteousness;
losing righteousness we’re left with obedience.

Obedience to law is the dry husk
of loyalty and good faith.
Opinion is the barren flower of the Way,
the beginning of ignorance.

So great-minded people
abide in the kernel not the husk,
in the fruit not the flower,
letting the one go, keeping the other.
