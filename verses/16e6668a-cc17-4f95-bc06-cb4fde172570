Even if thou art the most sinful of the sinful, thou shalt cross over (the
ocean of) sin by the bark of wisdom.

As kindled fire reduces fuel to ashes. O Arjuna, so does the wisdom fire reduce
all actions (Karma) to ashes.

Nothing indeed in this world purifies like wisdom. He who is perfected by Yoga,
finds it in time within himself by himself.
