On rising, the physical sun lights up the physical world and everything in
it -- people, animals and the rest -- pouring its light equally over all;
it reigns at midday and then hides again, leaving in darkness the places
over which it shone. But the sun of the intellect, once it begins to shine,
shines always, totally and immaterially contained in everything and at the
same time remaining apart from its creatures, inseparably separated from
them, since it is wholly in everything and at the same time is in none of
the creatures exclusively (for at the same time it is elsewhere also). The
whole of it is in the visible and the whole of it is in the invisible;
it is totally present everywhere and yet exclusively present nowhere.
