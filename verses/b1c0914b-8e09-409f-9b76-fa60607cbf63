The person who considers himself superior to others constantly renders
judgments and perceives differences. He rigidly deals in opposites： good or
bad, right or wrong. If he follows his own standards of fairness, he’ll
have to reject at least half of creation.

A person who follows the Dharma strives to unify himself with the rest of
humanity. He doesn’t discriminate and is indifferent to qualitative
distinctions. He knows that Buddha Nature is the One, Indivisible Reality.
A person who follows the Dharma strives to remain ever-conscious of his
inclusion in that One.
