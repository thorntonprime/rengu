\"Oh - then you must be one of those who broaden their learning in order
to ape the sages, heaping absurd nonsense on the crowd, plucking the
strings and singing sad songs all by yourself in hopes of buying fame
in the world! You would do best to forget your spirit and breath, break
up your body and limbs - then you might be able to get somewhere. You
don't even know how to look after your own body - how do you have any
time to think about looking after the world! On your way now! Don't
interfere with my work!"
