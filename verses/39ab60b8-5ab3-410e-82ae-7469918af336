Yamaoka Tesshu was a tutor of the emperor. He was also a master
of fencing and a profound student of Zen.

His home was the abode of vagabonds. He had but one suit of
clothes, for they kept him always poor.

The emperor, observing how worn his garments were, gave Yamaoka
some money to buy new ones. The next time Yamaoka appeared he
wore the same old outfit.

"What became of the new clothes, Yamaoka?" asked the emperor.

"I provided clothes for the children of Your Majesty," explained
Yamaoka.
