Why's my heart always, always spinning?
A human's life is just a mushroom's life, finished in
 a morning.
How to bear that in two decades at the most
my family, all my friends, will be gone cold and
 fallen down.
These thoughts weigh on my heart, and so of course
 I grieve,
a grief like love, unbearable.
What to do, what should I do?
Take this body home
into my mountain shade.
