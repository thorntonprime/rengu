Motionless detachment makes a man superlatively Godlike. For that God is God
is due to his motionless detachment, and it is from his detachment that he
gets his purity and his simplicity and his immutability. ... Prayers and good
works wrought by a man in time affect no more the divine detachment than if
no prayers nor virtuous works had come to pass in time： nor is God any
kindlier disposed towards that wight than if his prayers and deeds had all
been left undone. Further I declare, when the Son in his Godhead was pleased
to be made man and was and suffered martyrdom, God’s motionless detachment
was no more disturbed than if he had never been made man.
