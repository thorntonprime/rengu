Title: Concepts, A Jar We Break
---
Anxious to see you, I died to the world.

Hearing your voice at the city's edge,
at the horizon of form and space,

how could I then notice anything hands made;
how could I adore or suffer
time?

Anxious to hold you, I forgot myself completely
but you did not care about the way I came to look; I mean
your shape and mine, what were those? --

the seed husk that falls,

because it could not contain our mingled feet.

Anxious to see you, our souls became your glory,
our eyes became your fire.

All concepts of God are like a jar
we break,

because only the infinite can
contain our perfect
love.
