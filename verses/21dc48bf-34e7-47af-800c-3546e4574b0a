Thirty spokes unite in one nave,
And because of the part where nothing exists we have the use of a carriage
  wheel.
Clay is moulded into vessels,
And because of the space where nothing exists we are able to use them as
  vessels.
Doors and windows are cut out in the walls of a house,
And because they are empty spaces, we are able to use them.
Therefore, on the one hand we have the benefit of existence, and on the other,
  we make use of non-existence.
