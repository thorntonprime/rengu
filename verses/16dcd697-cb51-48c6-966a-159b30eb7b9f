Is your voice “silence”?
When you are not singing a song then I hear your song’s melody clearly!
Your voice is silence.

Is your face “darkness”?
When I shut my eyes then I see your face clearly!
Your face is darkness.

Is your shadow “light”?
Your shadow is cast on the dark window after the moon has gone down!
Your shadow is light.
