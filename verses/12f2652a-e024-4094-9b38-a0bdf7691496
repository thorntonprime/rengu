The Mass each day purifies and baffles me at the, same time. This beautiful
mixture of happiness and lucidity and inarticulateness fills me with great
health from day to day. I am forced to be simple at the altar.

But in the middle of this beautiful sobriety the indescribably pure light of
God fills you with what can only be described as the innocence of childhood.

Day after day I am more and more aware how little I am my everyday self
at the altar： this consciousness of innocence is really a sense of
replacement. Another has taken over my identity, and this other is a
tremendous infancy. And I stand at the altar-excuse the language, these
words should not be extraordinary-but I stand at the altar with my eyes
washed in the light that is eternity, as ifI am one who is agelessly
reborn. I am sorry for this language. There are no words I know of simple
enough to describe such a thing, except that every day I am a day old,
and at the altar I am the Child Who is GodYet, when it is all over,
I have to say,“The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did
not comprehend it" Gohn 1：15), and I have to fall back into my own poor
self that cannot receive Him altogether, and I even have to rejoice at
being a shell. Well. I have contained some echo of His purity, and it
has meant something tremendous for me and for the whole world, so that
at my Memento of the living -- the prayer of remembering those for whom
I pray -- which is very long, I swim in seas of joy that almost heave me
of? my moorings at the altar.
