Work that produces unnecessary consumer junk and weapons of war is wrong
and wasteful. Work that is built upon false needs or unbecoming appetites
is wrong and wasteful. Work that deceives or manipulates, that exploits or
degrades is wrong and wasteful. Work that wounds the environment or makes
the world ugly is wrong and wasteful.
