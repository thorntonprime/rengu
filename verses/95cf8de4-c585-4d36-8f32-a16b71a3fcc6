The outward form is only a guide; God must become man, or else man becomes
not God.

Therefore a Christian is the most simple (or plainest) man upon the earth,
as Isaiah says. ‘Who is so simple as my servant?’ ... He must quite die
to self hood, that the same may only hang to him from without as a garment
of this world, wherein he is a stranger and pilgrim.
