  - Sacrifice-Death=Volition, Obedience and Conformity=Intention
By: St Augustine
---
God would have Himself gratuitously worshipped, would have Himself
gratuitously loved, that is chastely loved; not to be loved for the
reason that He giveth anything besides Himself, but because He giveth
Himself. He therefore that calleth upon God in order that he may be
made rich, doth not call on God. for he calleth upon that which he
wisheth to come to him.
