Look at people who keep tigers as pets. Even while they’re laughing and
playing with them, in the back of their minds they’re afraid their pet will
suddenly turn on them. They never forget how dangerous tigers are.

But what about people who lust after possessions, indulging themselves with
one acquisition after another. They remain completely unaware of any
danger.

Yet, the tiger can eat only a man’s flesh. Greed can devour his soul.
