  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
Youth is sharp-sighted and incorruptible. It hangs together and presents an
impenetrable front against grown-ups. It is not sentimental, one may approach
to it, but one cannot enter into it. Who has been evicted from that paradise
can never get back. There is a law of the years. Educationalists who think
they can understand the young are enthusiasts. Youth does not want to be
understood; it wants to be let alone. It preserves itself immune against the
insidious bacillus of being understood. The grown-up who would approach it too
importunately is as ridiculous in its eyes as if it had put on children's
clothes. We may feel with youth, but youth does not feel with us. That is
its salvation.
