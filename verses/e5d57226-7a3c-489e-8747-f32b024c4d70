Another fullness of time. If someone had the knowledge and the power to gather
up the time and all the happenings of these six thousand years and all that
is to come ere the world ends to boot, all this, summed up into one present
now, would be the fullness of time. This is the now of eternity, when the
soul knows all things in God, as new and fresh and lovely as I find them
now at present. The narrowest of the powers of my soul is more than heaven
wide. To say nothing of the intellect wherein there is measureless space,
wherein I am as near a place a thousand miles away as the spot I am standing
on this moment. Theologians teach that the angel hosts are countless, the
number of them cannot be conceived. But to one who sees distinctions apart
from multiplicity and number, to him, I say, a hundred is as one. Were there
a hundred Persons in the Godhead he would still perceive them as one God.
