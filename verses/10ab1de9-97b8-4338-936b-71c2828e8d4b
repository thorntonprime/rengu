Title: The Essence of Ritual
Description: July 11
---
Pray the prayer that is the essence
of every ritual. God, I have no hope.
I am torn to shreds. You are very first,
my last and only refuge.

Do not do daily prayers like a bird
pecking its head up and down.

Prayer is an egg.
Hatch out
the total helplessness inside.
