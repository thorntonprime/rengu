The Buddha Mind contains the universe. In this universe there is only one
pure substance, one absolute and indivisible Truth. The notion of duality
does not exist.

The small mind contains only illusions of separateness, of division. It
imagines myriad objects and defines truth in terms of relative opposites.
Big is defined by small, good by evil, pure by defiled, hidden by revealed,
full by empty. What is opposition? It is the arena of hostility, of
conflict and turmoil. Where duality is transcended peace reigns. This is
the Dharmaâ€™s ultimate truth.
