The Self (Âtman), indeed, is below. The Self is above. The Self is to the
west. The Self is to the east. The Self is to the south. The Self is to the
north. The Self, indeed, is this whole world.

Verily, he who sees this, who thinks this, who understands this ... he is
autonomous (sva-râj); he has unlimited freedom in all worlds.
