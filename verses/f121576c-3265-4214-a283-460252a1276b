Giving up all Dharmas (righteous and unrighteous actions), come unto
Me alone for refuge. I shall free thee from all sins; grieve not.

This should never be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerity
or without devotion, nor to one who does not render service, nor to
one who speaks ill of Me.
