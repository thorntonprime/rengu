Title: On Many an Idle Day
---
On many an idle day have I grieved over lost time. But it is never lost, my
 lord.
Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands.
  Hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds
into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness.
  I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. In
the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders of flowers.
