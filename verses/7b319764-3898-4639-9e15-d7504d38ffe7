Title: On the Eve of a Birthday
---
Snow, silence, the talking fire, the watch on the table. Sorrow. I will get
cleaned up (my hands are dirty). I will sing the psalms of my birthday.

No matter what mistakes and illusions have marked my life, most of it I
think has been happiness and, as far as I can tell, truth. There were whole
seasons of insincerity, largely when I was under twenty-one and followed
friends that were not my own kind. But after my senior year at Columbia
things got straight. I can remember many happy and illumined days and
whole blocks of time. There were a few nightmare times in childhood. But
at Saint Antonin, with Father, life was a revelation.Then again, at so many
various times and places, in Sussex (at Rye and in the country), at Oakham,
at Strasbourg, at Rome above all, in New York, especially upstate Clean and
St. Bonaventure’s. I remember one wonderful winter morning arriving at
Olean to spend Christmas with Bob Lax. Arrivals and departures on the Erie
were generally great.The cottage on the hill, too -- then Cuba： wonderful
days there. All this I have said before and the whole world knows it.

The profoundest and happiest times of my life have been in and around
Gethsemani, and also some of the most terrible. Mostly the happy moments
were in the woods and fields, alone, with the sky and the sun, and up here
at the hermitage.And with the novices (afternoons at work).
