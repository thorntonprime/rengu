Is it not lesse absurd, then strange, to see how some Men (who would
have the World account them learned ...) will not forbeare to ranke
True Magicians with Conjurers, Necromancers and Witches (those grand
Impostors) who violently intrude themselves into Magick, as if Swine
should enter into a faire and delicate Garden and (being in league
with the Devill) make use of his Assistance in their workes, to
counterfeit and corrupt the admirall wisdome of the Magi, betWeene
whom there is as large a difference as betweene Angels and Devils.
