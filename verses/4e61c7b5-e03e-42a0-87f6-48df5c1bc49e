Bassui wrote the following letter to one of his disciples who
was about to die：

"The essence of your mind is not born, so it will never die. It
is not an existence, which is perishable. It is not an
emptiness, which is a mere void. It has neither color nor form.
It enjoys no pleasures and suffers no pains.

"I know you are very ill. Liek a good Zen student, you are
facing that sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is
suffering, but question yourself： What is the essence of this
mind? Think only of this. You will need no more. Covet nothing.
Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving in the
pure air."
