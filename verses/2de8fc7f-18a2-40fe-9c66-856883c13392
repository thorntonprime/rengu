Do you realize what it is that is causing world chaos? ... it’s Nature
hitting back. Not with the old weapons -- floods, plagues, holocausts. We
can neutralize them. She’s fighting back with strange instruments called
neuroses. She’s deliberately affecting mankind with the jitters. Nature
is proving that she can’t be beaten -- not by the likes of us. She’s
taking the world away from the intellectuals and giving it back to the apes.
