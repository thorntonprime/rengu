The year of the dragon has so far distinguished itself by strong, lusty
winds -- great windstorm the other night, some trees blew down in the woods
near the heriiiitage (one across the path going up). Pine cones and bits of
branches all over the lawn.

The need tor constant self-revision, growth, leaving behind, a renunciation
of yesterday, yet in continuity with all yesterdays (to cling to the past
is to lose one‘s identity with it, for this means clinging to what was
not there). My ideas are always changing, always moving around one center,
always seeing the center from somewhere else'. I will always be accused of
inconsistencies -- and will no longer be there to hear the accusation.

“What makes us afraid is our great freedom in face of the emptiness that
has still to be Filled" (Karl Jaspers). And again these concluding words from
the arresting little pamphlet on The European Spirit： “The philosophically
serious European is faced today with the choice between opposed philosophical
possibilities. Will he enter the limited field of fixed truth which in the end
has only to be obeyed; or will he go into the limitless open truth? ... Will
he win this perilous independence in perilous openness, as in existential
philosophy, the philosophy of communication in which the individual becomes
himself on condition that others become themselves, in which there is no
solitary peace but constant dissatisfaction and in which a man exposes his
soul to suffering?"
