Commentary: |
  All this correspnds perfectly in mediaeval Christian terms with the
  princi0ples on which the Hindu caste system is based.

Those who preside over the practice of religion should be looked up to
and venerated as the soul of the body. ... The place of the head in the
body of the commonwealth is filled by the prince, who is subject only
to God and to those who exercise His office and represent Him on earth,
even as in the human body the head is quickened and governed by the soul.
The place of the heart is filled by the senate, from which proceeds the
initiation of good works and ill. The duties of eyes, ears, and tongue
are claimed by the judges and the governors of provinces. Officials and
soldiers correspond to the hands. Those who always attend upon the prince
are likened to the sides. Financial officers and keepers ... may be compared
with the stomach and intestines. ... The husbandmen correspond to the feet,
which always cleave to the soil, and need the more especially the care and
foresight of the head, since while they walk upon the earth doing service
with their bodies, they meet the more often with stones of stumbling, and
therefore deserve aid and protection all the more justly since it is they
who raise, sustain, and move forward the weight of the entire body. ...

Then and then only will the health of the commonwealth be sound and
flourishing, when the higher members shield the lower, and the lower respond
faithfully and fully in like measure to the just demands of their superiors,
so that each and all are as it were members one of another by a sort of
reciprocity, and each regards his own interest as best served by that which
he knows to be most advantageous for the others.
