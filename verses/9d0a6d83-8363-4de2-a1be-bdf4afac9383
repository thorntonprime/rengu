You're right
There is nothing more lovely
There's nothing more profound
Than the certainty
Than the certainty

That all of this will end
That all of this will end

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So while the mud
Reclaims our footprints
And while our bones keep looking back
The overgrowth is swallowing the path
There for the grace of god go we
There for the grace of god go we
There for the grace of time and chance
and entropy's cruel hands

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build until we've blistered our hands
So won't you stay here with me
We'll build us some temples
We'll build us some castles
We'll build us some monuments
And burn them all right down

So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me

And this will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one thing we remember
And this will be
The reason to have been here
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build until we've blistered our hands

This will be
The one thing we remember

So won't you stay here with me
And we'll build us some temples
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments
We'll build us some temples
Build us some castles
Build us some monuments

This will be
This will be
The one moment that matters
And this will be
The one moment that matters at all
