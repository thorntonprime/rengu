Title: If a Mouth Surrenders
---
The way my hands can get along with each other, I now get along with one
 and all.
Standing in a fierce lightning storm, I look around and see I am the highest
 object on a hill.
Though having become one with the sky, why would I ever strike myself? What
 do I fear from anything?
If any mouth thunders, that sound becomes sweet.
All rain and hail is very welcomed upon me, coming from the One Heart as
 it does
