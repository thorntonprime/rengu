Spiritual inebriation is this; that a man receives more sensible joy and
sweetness than his heart can either contain or desire. Spiritual inebriation
brings forth many strange gestures in men. It makes some sing and praise God
because of their fulness of joy; and some weep with great tears because of
their sweetness of heart. It makes one restless in all his limbs, so that he
must run and jump and dance; and so excites another that he must gesticulate
and clap his hands. Another cries out with a loud voice, and so shows forth the
plenitude he feels within; another must be silent and melt away, because of the
rapture which he feels in all his senses. At times he thinks that all the world
must feel what lie feels; at times he thinks that none can taste what he has
attained. Often he thinks that he never could, nor ever shall, lose this
well-being; at times he wonders why all men do not become God-desiring. At one
time he thinks that God is for him alone, or for none other so much as for him;
at another time he asks himself with amazement of what nature these delights
can be, and whence they come, and what has happened to him.
