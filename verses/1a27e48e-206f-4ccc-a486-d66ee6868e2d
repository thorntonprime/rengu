Master of the sword and brush,
I met three brilliant and virtuous rulers.
In the East they got my letters,
but they were not pleased.
In the West I strove
in battles for them,
but all to no reward.
Mastered the brush and mastered the sword ...
Today? I'm old of a sudden ...
What's left of my life is not worth a word.
