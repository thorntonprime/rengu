Title: Weary of Words
---
Zero weather. Good work yesterday afternoon with the novices, cutting wood
at the hermitage. Bright and cold. I went over to the Methodist Seminary
at Asbury.

On the way over and back, stopped to take pictures at Shakertown. Marvelous,
silent, vast spaces around the old buildings. Cold, pure light, and some
grand trees. So cold my finger could no longer feel the shutter release. Some
marvelous subjects. How the blank side of a frame house can be so completely
beautiful I cannot imagine. A completely miraculous achievement of forms.

The moments of eloquent silent and emptiness in Shakertown stayed with me
more than anything else -- like a vision.

Tired of war, tired of letters, tired of books. Shaving today, saw new
lines under the eyes, a new hollowness, a beginning of weariness. Well. So
it is good.

What matters most is secret, not said. This begins to be the most real and
the most certain dimension.

I had been secretly worried about my writing, especially on peace, getting
condemned. Nothing to worry about. Whenever I am really wrong, it will be
easy enough to change. But it is strange that such things should be regarded
with suspicion. I know this is wrong. Weary of blindness, of this blindness
that afflicts all men, but most of all of the blindness afflicting those
who ought to see.
