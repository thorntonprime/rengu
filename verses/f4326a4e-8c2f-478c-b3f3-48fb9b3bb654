It is the character only of a good man to be able to deny and disown
himself, and to make a full surrender of himself unto God; forgetting
himself, and minding nothing but the will of his Creator; triumphing
in nothing more than in his own nothingness, and in the allness of the
Divinity. But indeed this, his being nothing, is the only way to be
all things; this, his having nothing, the truest way of possessing all
things.
