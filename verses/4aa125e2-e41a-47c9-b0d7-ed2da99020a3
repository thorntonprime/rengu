And to think of all these things is still not enough. One must remember
many nights of love, of which none was like another. One must remember the
cries of women in labor and the pale, distracted sleep of those who have
just given birth and begin to close again. But one must also have been with
the dying and sat beside the dead in the room with the open window and the
fitful sounds of life. And it is still not enough to have memoriesï¼š one
must be able to forget them when they crowd the mind and one must have the
immense patience to wait until they come again. For it is not the memories
themselves. Only when they become our blood, our glance, our gesture, nameless
and indistinguishable from who we are only then can it happen that in a very
rare hour the first word of a poem rises from their midst and goes forth.
