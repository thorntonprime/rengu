In the primordial state of unity and universal immobility, oppositions did not
exist. All are derived from the diversification of beings, and from their
contacts caused by the universal rotation. They would cease, if diversity and
movement ceased. They do cease henceforth to affect the being who has reduced
his distinct self and particular movement nearly to nothing. This being no
longer enters into conflict with any being, because he is established in the
infinite, effaced in the indefinite. He has reached and holds himself at the
starting point of transformations, a neutral point where there are no
conflicts. By the concentration of his nature, the nourishment of his vital
spirit, and the gathering of all his powers, he is united to the principle of
all geneses. His nature being entire, his vital spirit being intact, no being
can injure him.
