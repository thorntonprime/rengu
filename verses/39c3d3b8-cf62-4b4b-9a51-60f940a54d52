CAUCHON. ... But it is not your place to correct the venerable Canon,
You forget who you are and who we are, We are your priests, your masters,
and your Judges, Beware of your pride, Joan.

JOAN (softly), I know that I am proud, But I am a daughter of God, If He
didn’t want me to be proud, why did He send me His shining Archangel
and His Saints all dressed in light? Why did He promise me that I shall
conquer all the men I have conquered? Why did He promise me a suit Of
beautiful white armor, the gift of my king? And a sword? And that I should
lead brave soldiers into battle while riding a fine white horse? If He
had left me alone, I would never have become proud.

CAUCHON, Take care of your words, Joan, You are accusing our Lord.

JOAN (makes the Sign of the Cross), Oh, God forbid, I say only that His
Will be done even if it means making me proud and then damning me for it,
That, too, is His Right.
