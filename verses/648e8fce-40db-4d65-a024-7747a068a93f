Thou knowest then, O soul, how thou art to demean thyself if thou wilt find
the Bridegroom in His secret place. But if thou wilt hear it again, hear this
one word full of substance and unapproachable truthï¼š Seek Him in faith and
love, without seeking to satisfy thyself in aught, or to understand more
than is expedient for thee to know; for faith and love are the two guides
of the blind, they will lead thee by a way thou knowest not to the secret
chamber of God. Faith, the secret of which I am speaking, is the foot that
journeys onwards to God, and love is the guide that directs its steps. And
while the soul meditates on the mysterious secrets of the faith, it will
merit the revelation, on the part of love, of that which the faith involves,
namely, the Bridegroom whom it longs for, in this life by spiritual grace,
and the divine union, as we said before,* and in the next in essential glory,
face to face, hidden now.
