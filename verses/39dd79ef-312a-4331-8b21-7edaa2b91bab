Sitting is the way to clarify the ground of experiences and to rest at
ease in your Actual Nature. This is called "the display of the
Original Face" and "revealinby the landscape of the basic ground."

Drop through this bodymind and you will be far beyond such forms as
sitting or lyingy down. Beyond considerations of good or bad,
transcend any divisions between usual people and sages, pass beyond
the boundary between sentient beings and Buddha

Putting aside all concerns, shed all attachments. Do nothing at all.
Don't fabricate any things with the six senses.

Who is this? its name is unknown; it cannot be called "body," it
cannot be called "mind." Trying to think of it. the thought vanishes.
Trying to speak of it, words die.

It is like a fool, an idiot. It is as high as a mountain, deep as the
ocean. Without peak or depths, its brilliance is unthinkable, it
shows itself silently. Between sky and earth, only this whole body is
seen.

This one is without compare -- he has Completely died. Eyes clear, she
stands nowhere. Where is there any dust? What can obstruct such a one?

Clear water has no back or from, space has no inside or outside.
Completely clear, its own luminosity shines before form and emptiness
were fabricated. Objects of mind and mind itself have no place to
exist.
