Title: Quid Pro Quo
---
I started to feel a couple of years ago that something just wasn't right,
 but I couldn't exactly put my finger on it.
So some silent but tough negotiating ensued between God and my soul that
 went on for a long time. Who could have foretold what then happened one day?
One afternoon when I was rising in prayer, having just bowed toward the
 sacred Kaaba,
God too was rising, with His head just having touched the ground, facing me.
I could have sworn He said, Quid pro quo.
But don't quote me on that. For what would the mullahs think?
