Title: Flower Fight
---
Planting azaleas, you said, “Let’s have a flower-fight when they bloom.”
The flowers have bloomed and are fading.
Aren't you coming? Have you forgotten your words?

Red blossoms in one hand, white ones in the other, I start the battle.
You’re the winner and I lose.
When we meet for the real contest,
I’ll have the red blossoms and you the white --
then you’ll lose to me each time.
Not because I like to win, but because you like to let me.
Each time I win I’ll ask for the winner’s prize,
then you’ll smile at me and touch your lips to my cheek.

The flowers have bloomed and are fading.
Aren’t you coming? Have you forgotten your words?
