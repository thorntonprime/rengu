The Way conceives them.
Integrity receives them.
Matter allows them.
Nature endows them.

All creatures thus respect the Way
and honor its Integrity.
No one demands that this be so.
Their respect by nature ever flows.

The Way gives birth to them and nurtures them.
It shapes them, develops them,
shelters them, strengthens them,
sustains them, preserves them.

Creating, not claiming as one's own,
working, not waiting for return,
guiding, not seeking to controlï¼š
such is the wonder of integrity.
