The peach would pass the summer blooming,
but wind and moon cannot be made to wait.
I've looked around for men of the Han,
and, can it be, there isn't one ...
Morning after morning, one dynasty, another,
the flowers keep on falling ...
Year by year the harvest's menï¼š
they change, and then they're gone.
Here, where the heat of the sun stirs the dust,
another day there was an ocean.
