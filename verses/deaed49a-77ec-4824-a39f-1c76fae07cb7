The causes of passions are sinful deeds; of thoughts—passions; of imagination
-- thoughts; the cause of opinions is memory (become multiform); of
memory—forgetfulness (of what is true and needful); the mother of
forgetfulness is ignorance; of ignorance -- laziness; laziness is bom of
lustful desire; desire is born of movement in a false direction; movement in
a false direction comes from committing an action; such action is the fruit
of a foolish tendency to evil and of adherence to the senses and sensory
things.
