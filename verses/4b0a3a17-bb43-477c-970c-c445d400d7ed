A pleasant letter I hold to be the pleasantest thing that this world has to
give. It should be good-humoured; witty it may be, but with a gentle diluted
wit. Concocted brilliancy will spoil it altogether. Not long, so that it
will be tedious in the reading; nor brief, so that the delight suffices
not to make itself felt. It should be written specially for the reader,
and should apply altogether to him, and not altogether to any other. It
should never flatter. Flattery is always odious. But underneath the visible
stream of pungent water there may be the slightest undercurrent of eulogy,
so that it be not seen, but only understood. Censure it may contain freely,
but censure which in arraigning the conduct implies no doubt as to the
intellect. ... Then let its page be soiled by no business; one touch
of utility will destroy it all . ... But, above all things, see that it
be good-humoured.
