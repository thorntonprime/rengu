\"Well then, suppose I am inwardly direct, outwardly compliant, and do
my work through the examples of antiquity? By being inwardly direct, I
can be the companion of Heaven. Being a companion of Heaven, I know
that the Son of Heaven and I are equally the sons of Heaven. Then why
would I use my words to try to get men to praise me, or try to get them
not to praise me? A man like this, people call The Child. This is what
I mean by being a companion of Heaven.
