The high official Chencao called on Zifu.

Fu saw him coming then drew the appearance of one
circle.

Cao said, "Your disciple comes in this way, before is or
is not manifests plainly, why still more in this situation do you draw
the appearance of one circle?

Fu then shut and withdrew behind the door of his
"ten-foot-square" (i.e., the abbot's room).

Xuedou said, "Chencao only possessed the one single
eye."
