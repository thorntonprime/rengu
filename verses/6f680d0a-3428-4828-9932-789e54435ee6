Title: The Poem That Was Here Got the Cane
Description: September 25
---
The poem that was here ... got the cane, it rambled too much, and really said
 so little that was unique; I think it would have bored you. And why do that?
In its place I will tell you of an experience I just had a minute ago. My
 right eye felt blurred, and its vision became impaired in an odd, curious way,
 and I thought O maybe I am dying. Wonderful.
I brought myself before a mirror and looked in to see if I might someway
 help the situation, but instead saw another me. How to describe that? Well,
 I will try.
I was a primal, luminous being in perfect harmony with anything I could
 conceive. And anything I could conceive I could control, as I was its very
 creator, its very source. Nothing could ever be in opposition to the truth
 of myself. All was like at a table God set Himself, with a profound care
 for His court, that produced an effulgent synergy. I felt like a deity,
 helping to host a royal event： Existence.
Anything to do with any name or any conventional life was of gigantic
 insignificance-a colossal fantasy, a child’s imaginary, innocent game that
 could somehow have the strength to veil one from the Sun we are.
Though a Sun, now for me, that I can still see and touch whenever I want. It
 has really been this way for years for me, and the experience can so easily
 deepen, change, as it never wants to bore. It can’t.
