The gods and the sages experience the Infinite continuously and eternally,
without their vision being obscured at any moment. Their minds are surmised by
the spectators to function; but in fact they do not. Such surmise is due to
the sense of individuality in those who draw inferences. There is no mental
function in the absence of individuality. Individuality and mind functions
are co-existent. The one cannot remain without the other.
