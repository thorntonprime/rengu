Breath, you invisible poem!
A constant interchange between our clear being
and the world space beyond our seeing
in which I rhythmically become.

Solitary wave whose
gradual sea I am.
Of all possible seas you are parsimonious,
winning the cosmos, with me one gram

in it. How many realms of space have been
inside me already! The multiple wind
is like my son.

Air, do you know me? You are full of places
once mine. A uniquely smooth rind,
a leaf of my words among roundnesses.
