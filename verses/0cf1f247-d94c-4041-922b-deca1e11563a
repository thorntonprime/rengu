As these flowing ñvers that tend toward the ocean, on reaching the ocean,
disappear, their name and form are destroyed, and it is called simply ‘the
ocean’ -- even so of this spectator these sixteen parts that tend toward the
Person, on reaching the Person, disappear, their name and form are destroyed,
and it is called simply ‘the Person’. That one continues without parts,
immortal!
