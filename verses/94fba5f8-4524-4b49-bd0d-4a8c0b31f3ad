The Essence (Dhat) denotes Absolute Being stripped of all modes, relations,
and aspects. Not that they are outside of Absolute Being; on the contrary,
they belong to it, but hey are in it neither as themselves nor as aspects of
it; no, they are identical with the being of the Absolute. The Absolute is the
simple essence in which no name or quality or relation is manifested. When
any of these appears in it, that idea is referred to that which appears in
the Essence, not to the pure Essence, inasmuch as the Essence, by the law
of its nature, comprehends universals, particulars, and relations, not as
they are judged to exist, but as they are judged to be naughted under the
might of the transcendental oneness of the Essence.
