By: Chang Po-tuan
Commentary: |
  In The Secret Papers in the Jade Box of Ch'ing-hua
  (Davis/Yün-ts'ung： AAAS 73-13) we even have a ‘furnace' diagram (p.
  387. Figure 3). It shows the Sage himself seated in meditation, his
  robe open, with eight kua (broken and closed lines representing
  different combinations of yin and yang) forming an octagon around his
  navel. Other centers are marked in a way that immediately brings to
  mind the kundalini. An inscription at the left reads： 'This ting
  (tripod) and furnace picture is as clear as is indicated here'.

Do not waste your time in building mud furnaces for tan (medicine).
The compounding of medicines should be carried out in a yen yiieh lu
(lie-down-moon-fumace) which has a natural true fire and season, and
does not require a supply of wood or charcoal and the blowing of air.
