How vainly men themselves amaze,
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,
And their incessant labours see
Crown’d from some single herb or tree.
Whose short and narrow verged shade
Does prudently their toils upbraid;
While all the flow’rs and trees do close
To weave the garlands of repose!

Fair quiet, have I found thee here,
And innocence, thy sister dear!
Mistaken long, I sought you then
In busy companies of men.
Your sacred plants, if here below,
Only among the plants will grow;
Society is all but rude
To this delicious solitude.
