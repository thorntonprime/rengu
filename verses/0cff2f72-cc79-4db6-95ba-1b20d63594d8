Title: As Ripeness Comes
Page: 282

What souls desire arrives.
We are standing up to our necks in the sacred pool.
Majesty is here.

The grains of the earth
take in something they do not understand.

Where did this come from?
It comes from where your longing comes.

From which direction?
As ripeness comes to fruit.

This answer lights a candle
in the chest of anyone who hears.

Most people only look for the way when hurt.
Pain is a fine path to the unknowable.

But today is different.
Today the quality we call splendor
puts on human clothes, walks through the door,
closes it behind, and sits down with us
in this companionship.
