The Deity is absolute. It transcends human words, which are of a relative
nature. It is incomprehensible, and yet it permeates all things. It is
everywhere. People as a rule, not knowing this truth, visit a hundred shrines
day by day to worship there, and make valuable offerings month by month,
and yet they are not sure to obtain any reward, though they may perchance
suffer misfortunes in the world.
