Belief in one God is the corner-stone of all religions. But I do not foresee
a time when there would be only one religion on earth in practice. In theory,
since there is one God, there can be only one religion. But in practice,
no two persons I have known have had the same identical conception of
God. Therefore, there will perhaps always be different religions answering
to different temperaments and climatic conditions.
