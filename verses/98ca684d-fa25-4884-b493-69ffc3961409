Being is a term for immutability. For all things that are changed cease to be
what they were, and begin to be what they were not. True being, pure being,
real being has no one save Him who does not change. He has it to whom is said,
â€˜Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed. But Thou art always the
self-same'.
