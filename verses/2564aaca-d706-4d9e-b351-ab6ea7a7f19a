(Pythagoras) adds, that the survey of all heaven, and of the stars that revolve
in it, is indeed beautiful, when the order of them is considered. For they
derive this beauty and order by the participation of the first and the
intelligible essence. ... And wisdom indeed, truly so called, is a certain
science which is conversant with the first beautiful objects, and these divine,
undecaying, and possessing an invariable sameness of subsistence; by the
participation of which other things also may be called beautiful.
