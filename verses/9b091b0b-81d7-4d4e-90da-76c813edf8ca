The building up of good and evil both involve attachment to form.
Those who, being attached to form, do evil, have to undergo various
incarnations unnecessarily; while those who, being attached to form,
do good, subject themselves to toil and privation equally to no
purpose. In either case it is better to achieve sudden
self-realization and to grasp the fundamental Dharma.
