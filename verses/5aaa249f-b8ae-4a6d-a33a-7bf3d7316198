Noble Auctors men of glorious fame,
Called our Stone Microcosmus by name;
For his composition is withouten doubt,
Like to this World in which we walke about;
Of Heate, of Cold, of Moyst and of Drye,
Of Hard, of Soft, of Light and of Heavy,
Of Rough, of Smooth, and of things Stable,
Medled with things fleetinge and moveable;
Of all kinds Contrary broght to one accord.
Knit by the doctrine of God our blessed Lord;
Whereby of Mettalls is made transmutation.
Not only in Colour, but transubstantiation.
