The soul that finds not some solid and self-sufficient good to centre itself
upon, is a boisterous and restless thing： and being without God, it wanders
up and down the world, destitute, afflicted, tormented with vehement hunger
and thirst after some satisfying good： and, as any one shall bring it
tidings, ‘Lo here, or Lo there is good,’ it presently goes out towards it,
and with a swift and speedy flight hastens after it. The sense of an inward
indigency doth stimulate and enforce it to seek its contentment without
itself, and so it wanders up and down from one creature to another; and thus
becomes distracted by a multiplicity of objects. And while it cannot find
some one and only object upon which, as being perfectly adequate to its
capacities, it may wholly bestow itself; while it is tossed with restless and
vehement motions of desire and love through a world of painted beauties,
false glozing excellencies; courting all, but matching nowhere; violently
hurried everywhere, but finding nowhere objectum par amori; while it
converseth only with these pinching particularities here below, and is not
yet acquainted with the universal goodness; it is certainly far from true
rest and satisfaction, from a fixed, composed temper of spirit.
