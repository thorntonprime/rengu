As Tullius says, in his De Senectute, ‘natural death is, as it were,
our haven after a long voyage, and our repose.’ And as a good sailor,
when he nears the harbour, lowers his sails, and gently and with
feeble headway enters it, so should we lower the sails of our worldly
occupations, and return to God with all our mind and heart, so that we
may enter our haven with all gentleness and all peace. And our own
nature teaches us much as to the gentleness (of natural death);
because in such a death there is no pain, nor any bitterness; but as a
ripe apple lightly and without violence detaches itself from the
bough, so our soul, without pain, leaves the body in which it has
been. Wherefore Aristotle, in his Youth and Old Age, says that the
death which comes to old age is a death without sadness.
