Bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either
from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the
mindâ€™s eye. quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when
he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to
laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter
life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned
from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.
