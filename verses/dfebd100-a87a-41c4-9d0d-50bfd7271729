  - Invocation=The Universal Elixir
By: Epictetus
---
If we had sense we ought to do nothing else, in public and in private,
than praise and bless God and pay Him due thanks. ...

More than thatï¼š since most of you are walking in blindness, should there
not be some one to discharge this duty and sing praises to God for all? What
else can a lame old man as I am do but chant the praise of God? If, indeed. I
were a nightingale I should sing as a nightingale, if a swan, as a swan;
but as I am a rational creature I must praise God. This is my task, and I
do it; and I will not abandon this duty, so long as it is given me; and I
invite you all to join in this same song.
