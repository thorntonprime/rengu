The sun illumines the universe, whereas the Sun of Arunachala is so
dazzling that the universe is obscured and an unbroken brilliance
remains. But it is not realised in the present state and can be
realised only if the lotus of the heart blossoms. The ordinary lotus
blossoms in the light of the visible sun, whereas the subtle Heart
blossoms only before the Sun of Suns. May Arunachala make my heart
blossom so that His unbroken Brilliance may shine all alone!
