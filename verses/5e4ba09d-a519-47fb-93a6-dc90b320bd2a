Therefore, lay aside this corpse-like body as though it were truly a
corpse. Do not even murmer T but enquire keenly within what it is that
now shines within the heart as T . Transcending the intermittent flow
of diverse thoughts there arises the continuous, unbroken awareness,
silent and spontaneous, as â€˜I -- I' in the Heart. If one catches it
and remains still, it will completely annihilate the sense of 'I' in
the body and itself disappear as a fire of burning camphor. Sages and
scriptures proclaim this to be Liberation
