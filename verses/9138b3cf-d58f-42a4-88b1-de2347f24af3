    Title: A Coin Lost in the River Is Found in the River
    By: Zoketsu Norman Fischer

Our life is already fine the way it is. Everything that happens is already a
manifestation of our original enlightenment even though we don’t know it. We
don’t need to enter another condition or improve or disprove anything. The
gentle rain of the Dharma is falling all the time evenly and freely on
everything, and each thing receives that rain and uses it in its own way, each
in a different way. The whole world is unfolding in a beautiful and perfect
interplay of forces. We may have difficulty appreciating this but after all we
are only people and why would we not have difficulty? Our difficulty is this：
our minds can’t see difference without making comparisons, without making
judgments and having preferences. We want either everything to be the same as
everything else, which it is although we can't experience it that way, or if
things must be different from one another we struggle to rank them.
