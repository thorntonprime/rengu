Title: Hidden Movements of Christ's Grace
---
I don’t know what I have written that I could really call mine, or what I
have prayed or done that was good that came from my own will. Whose prayer
made me pray again to God to give me grace to pray? I could have fought
for years by myself to reduce my life to some order (for that was what
I was trying to do -- even to ridiculous extremes and the most eccentric
disciplines, keeping records of what I drank, trying to cut out smoking
by reducing the number of cigarettes every day, noting down the numbers in
a book ... weighing myself every few days, etc.!), yet I would have slowly
eaten myself out, I think. But someone must have mentioned me in some prayer;
perhaps the soul of some person I hardly remember-perhaps some stranger in
a subway, or some child -- or maybe the fact that someone as good as Lilly
Reilly happened to think I was a good guy served as a prayer -- or the fact
that Nanny might have said my name in her prayers moved the Lord God to send
me a little grace to pray again or, first, to begin reading books that led
me there again -- and how much of it was brought on by the war? Or maybe
Brahmachari in some word to the Lord in his strange language moved the Lord
to help me pray again! These things are inscrutable and I begin to know them
better when I can write them down. How many people have become Christians
through the prayers of Jews and Hindus who themselves find Christianity
terribly hard? We cannot know all the movements of Christ’s grace.
