We can enjoy the divine mind through various Ideas, seek it through various
traces (vestigia), travel toward that goal by various paths (God) so disposed
the intellectual eyes and the tendencies of various Souls in different manners,
in order that we may approach the different possessions of the manifold divine
goods by different paths.
