Man is made to be the plaything of God, and this, truly considered, is the
best of him; wherefore also every man and woman should walk seriously, and
pass life in the noblest of pastimes, and be of another mind from what they
are at present. ... And what is the right way of living? ... We ought to
live sacrificing, and singing, and dancing, and then a man will be able to
propitiate the Gods.
