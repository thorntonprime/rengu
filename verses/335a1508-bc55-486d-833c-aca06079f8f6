No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put
in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.

Neither do men put new wine into old bottles; else the bottles break, and the
wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new
bottles, and both are preserved.
