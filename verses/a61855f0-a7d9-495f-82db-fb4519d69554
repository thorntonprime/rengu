Title: Stopping the Mind

When Hui-k'o asked Bodhidharma to help him make his mind stop,
the First Patriarch of Zen said, "Show me this mind of yours, and
I'll make it stop." Hui-k'o answers, "But I've looked everywhere,
and I can't find the mind." Bodhidharma said, "There. I've stopped it
for you."
