Chi Ch'e said, "When a great sage rules the world, he makes the minds
of his people free and far-wandering. On this basis he fashions
teachings and simplifies customs, wiping out all treason from their
minds and allowing each to pursue his own will. All is done in
accordance with the inborn nature, and yet the people do not know why
it is like this. Proceeding in this way, what need has he either to
revere the way in which Yao and Shun taught their people, or to look
down on it in lofty contempt? His only desire is for unity with Virtue
and the repose of the mind."
