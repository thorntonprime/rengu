Happy? That was old Huntun ...
Never got hungry, never even took a piss,
until he ran into those grateful friends (those fools)
who drilled the seven holes in him.
Up in the morning, work all day
just to get our food and clothes：
harvesting enough to pay our rent and taxes.
A thousand hands after just one coin ...
All together shout it out now： Run for your life!
