The only thing we can be sure of is that we cant’ be sure of anything. The
only fact that doesn’t change is the fact that all things constantly
change. The saints cultivated patience. No matter what situation they found
themselves in, they calmly waited. They also understood that in matters of
the heart it’s not the object alone that alters, but the subject, too,
which proves fickle. Desire just might be the most changeable thing of all.
