Title: Making the Rounds and Causing Trouble
---
The words renounce and discipline were making the rounds and causing trouble,
  as some might expect.

Some newlyweds came to me to discuss the threat this posed.

They looked at me with serious faces and sincerely asked,

Does God want us to renounce the sweet pleasures our bodies and the earth may
  give?

And I replied, Do what most enables you to fly, and brings a feeling to the
  heart that makes you glad to be alive.

My guests then said, Is it really that simple?

And I said, Why not?
