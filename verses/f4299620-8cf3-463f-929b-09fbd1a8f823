The root-word buddh means to wake up, to know, to understand; and he
or she who wakes up and understands is called a Buddha. It is as simple
as that. The capacity to wake up, to understand, and to love is called
Buddha nature. When Buddhists say “I take refuge in the Buddha,” they
are expressing trust in their own capacity of understanding, of becoming
awake. The Chinese and the Vietnamese say, “I go back and rely on the
Buddha in me." Adding “in me" makes it very clear that you yourself are
the Buddha.
