Those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white
spot on a date-stone.

If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they
could not grant it to you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown
association with you. And none can tell thee like One who is Informed!
