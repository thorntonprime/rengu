Title: Blessings of Emptiness and Peace
---
I am glutted with books and a million trifles besides articles on this and
that. I balk at reading about Panama. I have had enough. (Yet I will read
it because I am obliged in conscience to, know at least vaguely what is
happening.) Panama, Zanzibar, Cypress (Costas Papademas wrote from there,
he flew back at Christmas), Kenya (Joy French wrote from there today --
first time I have seen the new stamp of the independent nation), and then
“the freeze” (on nuclear weapons) and various iniquities in Washington,
and nonsense in Vietnam (new dictator), so on and so on. Does one have to
read all this? Enough! Thank God tomorrow is Lent. I am glutted.

Today constant snow, ever so blinding, pale bright blue sky such as I have
sometimes seen in England on rare days in East Anglia. All the trees heavy
with snow and the hills hanging like white Clouds in the sky. But much of
the snow has melted off the trees and there is slight mist over the sunny
valley. No jets, for a wonder! Only a train off towards Lebanon. Quiet
afternoon! Peace! May this Lent be blessed with emptiness and peace and faith.

The woods echo with distant crows. A hen sings out happily at Andy Boone‘s,
and snow falling from the trees makes the woods sound as though they were
full of people walking through the bushes.
