\"I have heard that the ruler of Wei is very young. He acts in an
independent manner, thinks little of how he rules his state, and fails
to see his faults. It is nothing to him to lead his people into peril,
and his dead are reckoned by swampfuls like so much grass. His people
have nowhere to turn. I have heard you say, Master, 'Leave the state
that is well ordered and go to the state in chaos! At the doctor's gate
are many sick men.' I want to use these words as my standard, in hopes
that I can restore his state to health."
