What does the Lord Krishna teach in holding a flute in his hands? What is the
symbolic meaning of the flute? It is the symbol OM. It says： ‘Empty thyself
of all egoism, and I will play on the flute of thy body. Let thy will become
one with My will. Take refuge in OM. thou wilt enter into My being. Listen
to the moving interior music of the soul and rest in eternal Peace!’
