Oh! the charm of the Name! It brings light where there is darkness, happiness
where there is misery, contentment where there is dissatisfaction, bliss
where there is pain, order where there is chaos, life where there is death,
heaven where there is hell, God where there is Maya. He who takes refuge in
that glorious Name knows no pain, no sorrow, no care, no misery. He lives
in perfect Peace.
