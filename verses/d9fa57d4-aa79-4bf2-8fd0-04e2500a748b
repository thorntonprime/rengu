Our life must be converted into its contrary. We must unlearn those
things which we have learned; by learning them we have hitherto not
known ourselves. We must learn those things we have neglected; without
knowing them we cannot know ourselves. We must like what we neglect,
neglect what we like, tolerate what we flee, flee what we follow, We
must cry about the jest of fortuneï¼š jest about its tears.
