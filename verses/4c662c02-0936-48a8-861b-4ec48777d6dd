Let us pledge to him that all our own power will remain dismantled and
will keep on being dismantled among us. Let us pledge that the only thing
that will count among us will be the power and authority of God in jesus
Christ through the Holy Spirit; that it will never again be us that count
but that God above will rule and govern in Christ and the Holy Spirit.
