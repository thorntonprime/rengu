(Pythagoras) fixed his intellect in the sublime symphonies of the world, he
alone hearing and understanding, as it appears, the universal harmony and
consonance of the spheres, and the stars that are moved through them, and which
produce a fuller and more intense melody than any thing effected by mortal
sounds. This melody also was the result of dissimilar and variously differing
sounds, celerities, magnitudes, and intervals, arranged with reference to each
other in a certain most musical ratio, and thus producing a most gentle, and at
the same time variously beautiful motion and convolution.
