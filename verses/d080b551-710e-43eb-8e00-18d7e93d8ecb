I know that your profession is difficult and contrary to your nature. I cannot
remove your distress; I can only urge you to consider whether all occupations
are not challenging and hostile in some measure to one's individuality, and
saturated with the resentments of those who grimly and sullenly pursue them
from duty only. The situation in which you must live now is not more burdened
with conventions, prejudices and errors than any other -- and even if some
occupation appears to offer greater freedom, it is a rare person who is able to
stay open to the great matters that shape authentic living. Only the person who
accepts solitude can place himself under the deep laws of the universe. When he
steps into the fresh morning or out into the event-filled evening, all that is
not him falls away, as if he had died, although he stands in the teeming midst
of life.
