Title: Could Be Lifted
Description: January 7
---
If you knew the end of your story, nothing on any page -- not one of
your dramas, could bother you as much.

If you knew the glorious end of your journey, at least half of your
attention could be lifted from anything you can now focus on that
may cause you pain.

His hand is like that, when it is realized near, it will always turn
your gaze in the direction of more light.
