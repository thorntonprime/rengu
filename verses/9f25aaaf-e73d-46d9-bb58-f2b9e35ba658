Title: A short conceit of the work of this book, treated by question
---
But now thou askest me and sayest, “How shall I think on Himself, and what
is He?” and to this I cannot answer thee but thus： “I wot not.”

For thou hast brought me with thy question into that same darkness, and
into that same cloud of unknowing, that I would thou wert in thyself. For of
all other creatures and their works, yea, and of the works of God’s self,
may a man through grace have fullhead of knowing, and well he can think of
them： but of God Himself can no man think. And therefore I would leave
all that thing that I can think, and choose to my love that thing that I
cannot think. For why; He may well be loved, but not thought. By love may
He be gotten and holden; but by thought never. And therefore, although it be
good sometime to think of the kindness and the worthiness of God in special,
and although it be a light and a part of contemplation： nevertheless yet in
this work it shall be cast down and covered with a cloud of forgetting. And
thou shalt step above it stalwartly, but Mistily, with a devout and a pleasing
stirring of love, and try for to pierce that darkness above thee. And smite
upon that thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love; and
go not thence for thing that befalleth.
