Cultivate the habit of going to sleep early. This is the best regimen for
maintaining a strong and peaceful mind. People who stay up late need to
show off and entertain their friends. Or else they’re bored and need
excitement. Even if they sleep late, they’re still tired when they get up,
still sluggish in body and mind. They can’t work or think well at all.
People who follow the Dharma lead fuller, richer lives. They don’t need
other people for support. Good habits are like muscles, the more they are
exercised, the stronger they become.
