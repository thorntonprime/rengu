Put a bar of iron in a fiery forge, and it will become red like the fire. Take
it out, and it will lose its red colour. If you want it to remain red, you
must leave it constantly in the fire. In the same way, if you want your mind
to remain always filled with divine wisdom, you must leave it continually in
contact with the fire of the knowledge of Brahman, by a constant and intense
meditation. You must maintain the incessant undulation of a state of brahmic
consciousness. You will thus be in ‘the natural state’ (sahaja avasthâ).
