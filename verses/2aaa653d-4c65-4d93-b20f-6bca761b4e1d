Raised：

The Śūraṅgama Sūtra says, "When I do not see, why don't
[you] see the locus of my not seeing? If [you] see the not
seeing, intrinsically that is not the characteristic of not seeing. If
[you] don't see the ground of my not seeing, intrinsically [it] is not
an object, why say [it] is not you?"

[Xuedou's ode says]：

The whole elephant and the whole ox – are not different from cataracts.

Those who act in accord with what comes share the names and patterns.

So now wanting to see the yellow-headed elder ,

Every grain of dust of every realm is half the way
