Title: You Are Most Handsome
---
Think that you're gliding out
from the face of a cliff like an eagle.

Think that you're walking like a tiger walks
by himself in the forest.

You are most handsome when you are after food.
Spend less time with nightingales and peacocks.
One is just a voice, the other just a color.
