In governing the people and serving heaven
Moderation is best in a ruler.
By being moderate
One starts from the Way.
Starting from the Way
One gains a wealth of virtue.
Gaining a wealth of virtue
There is nothing that can’t be overcome.
When there’s nothing that can’t be overcome
There are no limitations.
When there are no limitations
The realm can be achieved.
When the mother of the realm is achieved,
One endures.
This is called ‘deep roots and a firm stem’
Through which one acquires long life.
