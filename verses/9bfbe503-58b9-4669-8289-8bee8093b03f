The men of old dwelt in the midst of crudity and chaos; side by side
with the rest of the world, they attained simplicity and silence there.
At that time the yin and yang were harmonious and still, ghosts and
spirits worked no mischief, the four seasons kept to their proper
order, the ten thousand things knew no injury, and living creatures
were free from premature death. Although men had knowledge, they did
not use it. This was called the Perfect Unity. At this time, no one
made a move to do anything, and there was unvarying spontaneity.
