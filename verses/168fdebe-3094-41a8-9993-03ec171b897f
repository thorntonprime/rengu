Are men exceedingly joyful? - they will do damage to the yang element.
Are men exceedingly angry? - they will do damage to the yin. And when
both yang and yin are damaged, the four seasons will not come as they
should, heat and cold will fail to achieve their proper harmony, and
this in turn will do harm to the bodies of men. It will make men lose a
proper sense of joy and anger, to be constantly shifting from place to
place, to think up schemes that gain nothing, to set out on roads that
reach no glorious conclusion. Then for the first time the world grows
restless and aspiring, and soon afterward appear the ways of Robber
Chih, Tseng, and Shih.
