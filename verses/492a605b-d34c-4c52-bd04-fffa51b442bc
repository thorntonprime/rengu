    Title: The Ascent to Truth
By: Thomas Merton

To be unable to understand the mysteries of faith is by no means to be
unable to believe them. And yet, as I have said, faith is in no way the blind
acceptance of a truth which we have no hope of understanding. Although we can
never comprehend the full meaning of these mysteries, yet faith is the key to a
relative understanding of them. It is after the initial act of belief that the
believer begins to see. Only then can the intellectual difficulties presented
by these mysteries be dealt with in a way that is in some sense satisfactory.
