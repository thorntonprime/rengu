Be content to remain, as it were, in prison for forty days and nights, even
as was the good Trevisan, and employ only gentle heat. Let your delicate
substance remain at the bottom, which is the womb of conception, in the
sure hope that after the time appointed by the Creator for this Operation,
the spirit will arise in a glorified state, and glorify its body -- that
it will ascend and be gently circulated from the centre to the heavens,
then descend to the centre from the heavens, and take to itself the power
of things above and things below.
