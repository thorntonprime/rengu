Seeking the builder of the house
I have run my course in the vortex
Of countless births, never escaping the hobble (of death);
111 is repeated birth after birth!
Householder, art seen!
Never again shalt thou build me a house.
All of thy rigging is broken,
The peak of the roof is shattered;
Its aggregations passed away.
Mind has reached the destruction of cravings.
