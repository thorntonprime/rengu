When all those about you say, “This is a man of talents and worth,” you
may not therefore believe it, When your great officers all say, “This
is a man of talents and virtue," neither may you for that believe it,
When all the people say, “This is a man of talents and virtue,” then
examine into the case, and when you find that the man is such, employ him.

When the people all say, “This man won't do,” then examine into the
case, and when you find that the man won’t do, send him away.

When all those about you say, " This man deserves death,” don’t
listen to them, When all your great officers say, “This man deserves
death,” don’t listen to them, When the people all say, “This man
deserves death,” then inquire into the case, and when you see that the
man deserves death, put him to death, In accordance with this we have
the saying, " The people killed him.”

You must act in this way in order to be the parent of the people.
