I find it more agreeable
To contemplate the stars
Than to sign a death warrant.
I find itmore agreeable
To listen to the flowers
Whisper “It is he!”
When I walk through the gardens
Than to stroke the rifles
That are to kill those who wish
To take my life.
That is why I shall never --
No, never --
Become a ruler.
