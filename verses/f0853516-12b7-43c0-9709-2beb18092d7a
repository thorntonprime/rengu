These words --
How easily understood!
How easily put in practice!
Yet no one understands them.
No one puts them to good use.

Words have history,
works authority.

Who know the Way, how few.
Who follow, how esteemed.

Who has integrity,
on his shoulders find coarse fabric,
in his bosom a precious gem.
