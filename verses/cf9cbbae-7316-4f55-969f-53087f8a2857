Title: First Love
---
Who were the first lovers and when did they meet?
Who were the first lovers and when did they part?
Were the first to meet the first to part, or was it another pair?

I think the first lovers to meet were the first lovers to part.
Meeting without parting -- that’s not love, it is myself.
Parting without meeting again -- that’s not love, it is a passerby.
When we meet love, we worry about parting;
  and when we part, we pledge to meet again.
This is the legacy of the first lovers’ parting.

Hence, not meeting is not love, and not parting is not love.
Meeting love gives me smiles, parting from love gives me tears.
Parting tears are better than meeting smiles;
  smiles upon meeting again are better than parting tears.
When will we share meeting-again smiles?
