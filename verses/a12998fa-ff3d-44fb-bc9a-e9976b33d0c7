\"But before the great turtle of the Eastern Sea had even gotten his
left foot in the well his right knee was already wedged fast. He backed
out and withdrew a little, and then began to describe the sea. `A
distance of a thousand li cannot indicate its greatness; a depth of a
thousand fathoms cannot express how deep it is. In the time of Yu there
were floods for nine years out of ten, and yet its waters never rose.
In the time of Tang there were droughts for seven years out of eight,
and yet its shores never receded. Never to alter or shift, whether for
an instant or an eternity; never to advance or recede, whether the
quantity of water flowing in is great or small - this is the great
delight of the Eastern Sea!'
