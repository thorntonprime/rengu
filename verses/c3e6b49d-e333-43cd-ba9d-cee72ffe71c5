When we speak of the All-Transcendent Godhead as an Unity and a Trinity. It is
not an Unity or a Trinity such as can be known by us or any other creature,
though to express the truth of Its utter Self-Union and Its Divine Fecundity
we apply the titles of ’Trinity" and ’Unity’ to That Which is beyond all
titles, expressing under the form of Being That Which is beyond Being. But
no Unity or Trinity or Number or Oneness or Fecundity or any other thing
that either is a creature or can be known to any creature, is able to utter
the mystery, beyond all mind and reason, of that Transcendent Godhead which
super-essentially surpasses all things. It hath no name, nor can It be grasped
by the reason; It dwells in a region beyond us, where our feet cannot tread.
