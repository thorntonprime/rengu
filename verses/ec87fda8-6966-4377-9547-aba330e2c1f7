There are some who, regarding laws in their literal sense in the light
of symbols of matters belonging to the intellect, are over punctilious
about the latter, while treating the former with easy-going
neglect.  ... Why, we shall be ignoring the sanctity of the Temple and
a thousand other things, if we are going to pay heed to nothing except
what is shown us by the inner meaning of things. Nay, we should look
on all these outward observances as resembling the body, and their
inner meaning as resembling the soul. It follows that, exactly as we
have to take thought for the body, because it is the abode of the
soul, so we must pay heed to the letter of the laws. If we keep and
observe these, we shall gain a clearer conception of those things of
which these are the symbols; and besides that we shall not incur the
censure of the many and the charges they are sure to bring against us.
