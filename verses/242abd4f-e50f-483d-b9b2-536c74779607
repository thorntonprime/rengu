Title: Shining Forth
---
In times of doubt I forget
that You are not a God

of thoughts, to be found
in concepts or theories

but are the source of
my life and the radiance

that shines forth in all
that is, and then I rememberï¼š

mine is the work of learning
to see You as the radiance

that shines forth in all that is,
even in the dark. Even in me.
