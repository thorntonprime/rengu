Limitless heaven and the huge earth are easily seen by the eye; but a tiny
piece of lint can destroy that eyeâ€™s vision. A heart filled with love can
expand into the universe; but a single hateful thought can puncture that
heart and let the love drain out. Never underestimate the power of small
things. The saints always gave full consideration to the tiniest thoughts.
