Title: The Turning Of Heaven

Confucius called on Lao Tan and spoke to him about benevolence and
righteousness. Lao Tan said, "Chaff from the winnowing fan can so blind
the eye that heaven, earth, and the four directions all seem to shift
place. A mosquito or a horsefly stinging your skin can keep you awake a
whole night. And when benevolence and righteousness in all their
fearfulness come to muddle the mind , the confusion is unimaginable.
If you want to keep the world from losing its simplicity, you must move
with the freedom of the wind, stand in the perfection of Virtue. Why
all this huffing and puffing, as though you were carrying a big drum
and searching for a lost child! The snow goose needs no daily bath to
stay white; the crow needs no daily inking to stay black. Black and
white in their simplicity offer no ground for argument; fame and
reputation in their clamorousness offer no ground for envy. When the
springs dry up and the fish are left stranded on the ground, they spew
each other with moisture and wet each other down with spit - but it
would be much better if they could forget each other in the rivers and
lakes!"
