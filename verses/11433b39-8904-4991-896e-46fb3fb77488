The Good is utterly alien to gods and men; but it is inseparable from God,
for it is God himself. All other gods are called good merely because men
have sought to honour them by giving them a title which belongs to God;
but God is called the Good not by way of honouring him, but because that
is his nature; for the nature of God is one and the same with the nature of
the Good. God then is the Good, and the Good is God.
