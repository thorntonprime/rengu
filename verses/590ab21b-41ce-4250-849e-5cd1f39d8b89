If I am asked in the place of Judgment why I have not done something,
I shall be more pleased than if I am asked why I have done
something -- i.e. there is egoism in every act of mine, and egoism is
dualism, and dualism is worse than sin, except as regards a pious act
that is done upon me and in which I have no part.
