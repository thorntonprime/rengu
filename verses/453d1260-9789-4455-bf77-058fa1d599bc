Yesterday, Third Sunday after Easter (already!) is my favorite, or one
of them. The Introit and the Alleluias especially. The afternoon was
warm and glorious with the new summer, the brand new summer, the wheat
already tall and waving in the wind, the great cumulous clouds. And all
the things one cannot begin to say about it -- the new awareness that I
am not the “object” that “they” think I am or even that I think,
and that the I which is not-I is All and in everyone, and that the outer
I must not assert itselfanymore but must be glad to vanish, and yet there
is no division between them, as there is no division between the surface
of the pond and the rest of it. It is the reflection on the surface that
seems to give it another being -- and no flatness, etc.

I sit in the cool back room, where words cease to resound, where all
meanings are absorbed in the tonsonantia of heat, fragrant pine, quiet Wind,
birdsong, and one central tonic note that is unheard and unuttered. Not
the meditation ofbooks, or of pieties, or of systematic trifles. In
the silence of the afternoon all is present and all is inscrutable. One
central tonic note to which every other sound ascends or descends, to which
every other meaning aspires, in order to find its true fulfillment. To
ask when the note will sound is to lose the afternoon： it has sounded,
and all things now hum with the resonance of its sounding.
