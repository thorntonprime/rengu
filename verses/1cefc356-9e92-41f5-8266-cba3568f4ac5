Title: Dongshan's Cold and Heat
---
A monk asked Dongshan. "So, how avoid the coming of the
winter cold and summer heat?"

Shan said. "Why not turn to the place without cold and
heat?"

The monk said, "So, what is the place without cold and
heat?"

Shan said, "In the cold time, the cold kills the
preceptor; in the burning time, the burning kills the preceptor."

Hanging down a hand is also identical to a 10,000 fathom precipice,

The Fair and the Biased, why must they be in a plan?

The ancient crystal palace reflects the brilliant moon.

The patient and capable Black vainly ascends
the steps.

Black.
