I do dimly perceive that whilst everything around me is ever-changing,
everdying, there is underlying all that change a Living Power that
is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and
re-creates. That informing Power or Spirit is God. And since nothing else
I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.
