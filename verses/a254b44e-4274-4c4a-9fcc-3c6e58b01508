Shih Ch'eng-ch'i went to see Lao Tzu. "I had heard that you were a
sage," he said, "and so, without minding how long the road was, I came
to beg an interview - a hundred nights along the way, feet covered with
calluses, and yet I did not dare to stop and rest. Now that I see you,
though, I find you are no sage at all. Rat holes heaped with leftover
grain and yet you turn your little sister out of the house, an unkind
act indeed! More raw and cooked food in front of you than you can ever
get through, and yet you go on endlessly hoarding goods!"  Lao Tzu
looked blank and made no reply.
