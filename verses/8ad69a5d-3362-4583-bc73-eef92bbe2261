Depart out of the earthly matter that encompasses theeï¼š escape, man, from the
foul prison-house thy body, with all thy might and main, and from the pleasures
and lusts that act as its jailers; every terror that can vex and hurt them,
leave none of them unused; menace the enemy with them all united and combined.
Depart also out of sense-perception thy kin. For at present thou hast made a
loan of thyself to each sense, and art become the property of others, a portion
of the goods of those who have borrowed thee, and hast thrown away the good
thing that was thine own.
