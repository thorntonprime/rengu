Sitting alone now, my mind's always flagging,
 suddenly
heart and mind, somehow, somewhere far off.
The clouds move so slow at the mountain's waist.
The fragrance of the valley rides sighing on the
 breeze.
Gibbons come so mild and languorous into the
 trees,
and the birds sing sad of autumn in the grove.
Time rushes, and the little hairs stand up;
so many harvests all used up; an old man's heart
just turns, and turns again.
