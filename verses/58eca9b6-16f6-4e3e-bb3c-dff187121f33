A man after fourteen years' penance in a solitary forest obtained at last the
power of walking on water. Overjoyed at this, he went to his Guru and said,
‘Master, master, I have acquired the power of walking on water.’ The master
rebukingly replied, ‘Fie, O child! is this the result of thy fourteen years'
labours? Verily thou hast obtained only that which is worth a penny; for what
thou hast accomplished after fourteen years’ arduous labour ordinary men do by
paying a penny to the boatman.’
