---
Too much color blinds the eye,
Too much music deafens the ear,
Too much taste dulls the palate,
Too much play maddens the mind,
Too much desire tears the heart.

In this manner the sage cares for peopleï¼š
He provides for the belly, not for the senses;
He ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.
