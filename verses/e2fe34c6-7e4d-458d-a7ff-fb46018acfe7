Iron Grindstone Liu arrived at Guishan. Shan said, "Old
cow, you came hah!"

Grindstone said, "In the coming day at Lookout Mountain
(Taishan) there is a great assembly to provide monks with a vegetarian
meal. Venerable, will you be leaving to go back there?"

Guishan relaxed his body and lay down to sleep.

Grindstone then left.
