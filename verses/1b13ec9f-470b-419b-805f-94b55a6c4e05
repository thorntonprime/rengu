Tat. What then is real, thrice-greatest one?

Hermes. That which is not sullied by matter, my son, nor limited by boundaries,
that which has no colour and no shape, that which is without integument, and is
luminous, that which is apprehended by itself alone, that which is changeless
and unalterable, that which is good.
