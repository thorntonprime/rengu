Title: More Range
---
We are friends with the one who kills us,
who gives us to the ocean waves.

We love this death. Only ignorance says,
Put it off a while, day after tomorrow.

Do not avoid the knife.
This friend only seems fierce,
bringing your soul more range,
perching your falcon on a cliff of the wind.

Jesus on his cross, Hallaj on his.
Those absurd executions hold a secret.

Cautious cynics claim they know
what they are doing every minute, and why.

Submit to love without thinking,
as the sun rose this morning
recklessly extinguishing
our star-candle minds.
