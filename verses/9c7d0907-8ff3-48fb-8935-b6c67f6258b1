\‘Gentlemen,’ said Monkey laughing, ‘I will not deceive you. If I had
wanted to be an Emperor, I could have had the throne in any of the ten
thousand lands and nine continents under heaven. But I have got used
to being a priest and leading a lazy, comfortable existence. An
Emperor has to wear his hair long; at nightfall he may not doze, at
the fifth drum he must be awake. Each time there is news from the
frontier his heart jumps; when there are calamities and disasters he
is plunged in sorrow and despair; I should never get used to it. You
go back to your job as Emperor, and let me go back to mine as priest,
doing my deeds and going upon my way.’
