For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost.

And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come,

If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing
they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an
open shame.

For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and
bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth
blessing from Godï¼š

But that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh unto
cursing; whose end is to be burned.
