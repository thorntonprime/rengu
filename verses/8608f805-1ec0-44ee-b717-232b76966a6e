Title: The Burning Ocean
---
Where are those who died serving God
on the plain of Karbala?

Where are those who know how to open the gate?
There is no rational answer to this.

A prison full of debtors has been let out.
Where has everyone gone? Where are you?

You are in the ocean,
of which this world is just foam thrown up on shore.

Something huge inside me surges,
and the foam of this poetry takes form.

Let form be.
Dive into the burning ocean,
as that source of light comes up in the east.
