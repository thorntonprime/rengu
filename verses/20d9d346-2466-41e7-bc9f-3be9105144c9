  - Sacrifice-Death=Sacrifice and Suffering
By: St Augustine
---
God died, that a kind of celestial exchange might be made, that men
might not see death For as much as He is both God and man, wishing
that we should live by that which was His, He died by that which was
ours. For He had nothing himself whereby He could die, nor had we
anything whereby we could live Seek for anything in God by which He
may die and thou wilt not find it. But we all die, who are flesh,
being men bearing on them sinful flesh. Seek for that whereby sin may
live; it hath nothing. So then neither could He have death by that
which was His, nor we life by that which was ours; but we have life by
that which is His, and He death by what is ours. What an exchange!
