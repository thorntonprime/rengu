The reality of the holy can only be grasped from the standpoint of the
mystery. Then one sees that the holy is not a segregated, isolated sphere
of Being, but signifies the realm open to all spheres, in which they can
alone find fulfilment. The face of the holy is not turned away from but
towards the profane; it does not want to hover over the profane but to
take it up into itself. “The mysteries always teach us to combine the
holy with the profane." The strict division between them has its place not
in the character and attitude of the holy but in those of the profane： it
is the profane which makes a fundamental and unsurmountable division between
itself and the holy, and on the other side the inadequate “usual” holiness
consists only in being separate from the profane, whereas the perfectly holy
thinks and wills nothing but unity. The contradictions between the spheres
of the holy and the profane exist only in the subjectivity of man who has
not yet attained to spiritual unity and is unable, with his limited powers
of understanding, to mediate between the two. In reality the main purpose
of life is to raise everything that is profane to the level of the holy.
