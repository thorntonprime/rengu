  One can understand here the importance attached to feathers and fringes in
  American Indian ornamentation. It may be added that they also correspond to
  rays of light, or showers of grace

The most important of all the creatures are the wingeds, for they are nearest
to the heavens, and are not bound to the earth as are the four-leggeds,
or the little crawling people.

It may be good to mention here that it is not without reason that we humans
are two-legged along with the wingeds; for you see the birds leave the earth
with their wings, and we humans may also leave this world, not with wings,
but in the spirit. This will help you to understand in part how it is that
we regard all created beings as sacred and important, for everything has a
wochangi or influence which can be given to us, through which we may gain
a little more understanding if we are attentive.
