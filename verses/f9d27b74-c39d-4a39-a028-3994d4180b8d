Title: Thrown into Contradiction
---
God reveals Himself in the middle of conflict and contradiction -- and we
want to find Him outside all contradiction.

Importance of contradiction： the contradiction essential to my existence
is the expression of the world's present： it is my contribution to the
whole. My contradiction and my conflict are my part in the whole. They are
my “place.” It is in my insight and acceptance of contradiction that the
world creates itself anew in and through my liberty -- I permit God to act in
and through me, making His world (in which all are judged and redeemed). I am
thrown into contradiction： to realize it is mercy, to accept it is love,
and to help others do the same is compassion. All this seems like nothing,
but it is creation. The contradiction is precisely that we cannot "be creative"
in some other way we would prefer (in which there is no contradiction).
