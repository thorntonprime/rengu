Jo of the North Sea said, "You can't discuss the ocean with a well frog
- he's limited by the space he lives in. You can't discuss ice with a
summer insect - he's bound to a single season. You can't discuss the
Way with a cramped scholar - he's shackled by his doctrines. Now you
have come out beyond your banks and borders and have seen the great sea
- so you realize your own pettiness. From now on it will be possible to
talk to you about the Great Principle.
