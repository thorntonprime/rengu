I am learning to see something new. In addition to sky and land, a third
thing has equal significanceï¼š the air.

Things usually appear to me as finite and limited in comparison with the great
body of Earth. But here there are many things that seem like islands-alone,
bright, caressed on all sides by ever-moving air that makes their forms
stand out so clearly.
