\"Nothing is as good as a boat for crossing water, nothing as good as a
cart for crossing land. But though a boat will get you over water, if
you try to push it across land, you may push till your dying day and
hardly move it any distance at all. And are the past and present not
like the water and the land, and the states of Chou and Lu not like a
boat and a cart?
