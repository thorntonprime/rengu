Thinking is without labour and bears no fruit. Meditation labours and
has its fruit.  Contemplation abides untoiling and fruitful. Thinking
roams about, meditation investigates.  contemplation wonders.
Thinking arises from the imagination, meditation from the reason,
contemplation from the intelligence. Behold these three, imagination,
reason, intelligence. Intelligence takes the highest place,
imagination the lowest, reason lies between them. Everything which
comes under the view of the lower sense, comes necessarily also under
the view of the higher sense. ... Behold then how wide is the extent
of the ray of contemplation, for it embraces all things.
