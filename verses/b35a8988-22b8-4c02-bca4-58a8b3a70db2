Wherever I gave special grace
I sought for the lowest and smallest and most hidden.
  The highest mountains may not receive
  The revelations of My Grace.
For the flood of My Holy Spirit
Flows by nature down into the valleys.
  One finds many a wise writer of books
Who in himself, to My sight, is a fool.
And I tell thee further, it greatly honours Me
  And strengthens mightily Holy Church
That unlearned lips should teach
  The learned tongues of My Holy Spirit.
