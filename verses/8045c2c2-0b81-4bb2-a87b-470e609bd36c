The accomplished person is not aggressive. The good soldier is not hot
 tempered.
The best conqueror does not engage the enemy. The most effective leader
 takes the lowest place.
This is called the Te of not contending. This is called the power of the
 leader. This is called matching Heaven's ancient ideal.
