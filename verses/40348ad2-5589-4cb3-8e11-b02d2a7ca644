Title: Love Makes Duty Beautiful
---
Yesterday, out in the beginning of a snowstorm, I dipped into the spiritual
notes of Charles de Foucauld and was moved by their intensity. He speaks to
God in a clear and vibrant voice, simple words, sentences of fire. This voice
rings in the ear of your heart after you have put the book away and turned
to other, less saintly voices, even though they may be religious voices,
too. M. LeFevre, who is teaching us chant, saw the book and told me how,
some twenty-five years ago, it had made him weep and had driven him to the
seminary. From which, he said, by the grace of God, he eventually emerged
again into the world. I forget whether he has ten children or twelve.

God gives Himself to those who give themselves to Him.The way does not
matter much, as long as it is the way He has chosen for us. I find that
I can get just as close to God in studying the dry problems of moral
theology as by reading the more burning pages of the mystics. For it is
Godâ€™s will that I, as a priest, should know my moral theology. Duty
does not have to be dull. Love can make it beautiful and fill it with
life. As long as we show lines of division between duty and pleasure in
the world of the spirit, we will remain far from God and from His joy.
