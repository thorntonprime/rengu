Description: September 30

Every day they fall, the leaves, a body dies and sings in a voice few hear.
And every hour life again moves new, a unique composite of everything,
 an infant.

 the streets, honored like a visiting prince.
The air, clearer today than I can remember. There was something about the wind
that was different. It seemed excited about some grand event it knew for

I said to the man behind the counter, “God is great and everywhere today.”
And the old merchant responded, “I am thankful Allah knows His place,
 His throne,
which is every atom, we too, are made to sit upon and reign.”
