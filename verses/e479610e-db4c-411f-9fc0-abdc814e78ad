    Title: The Book of Hours
Title: The Innerness of All Things
---
You create yourself in ever-changing shapes
that rise from the stuff of our days --
unsung, unmourned, undescribed,
like a forest we never knew.

You are the deep innerness of all things,
the last word that can never be spoken.
To each of us you reveal yourself differentlyï¼š
to the ship as a coastline, to the shore as a ship.
