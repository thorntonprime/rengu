Just as I am -- without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- though toss'd about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down;
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am -- of that free love
The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,
Here for a season, then above,
-- O Lamb of God, I come!
