In a Zen koan someone said that an enlightened man is not one who seeks
Buddha, or finds Buddha, but just an ordinary man who has nothing left to
do. And yet mere stopping is not to arrive. To stop is to stay a million
miles from it, and to do nothing is to miss it by the whole width of the
universe.Yet how close it is, how simple it would be to have nothing more
to do -- if I had only done it. Meanwhile I am more content than I have
ever been here with this unripeness, and thus I know that one day it will
ripen, and one will see there had been nothing there at all, except an
ordinary person with nothing to do in the first place.

The evening light. Purple coves and holes of shadow in the breasts of the
hills and the white gable ofNewtonâ€™s house smiling so peacefully amid
the trees in the middle of the valley. This is the peace and luminosity
William Blake loved. Today after dinner a hawk, circling the novitiate
and the church steeple, designed a free flight unutterably more pure than
skating or music. How he flung himself down from on high and swooped up
to touch lightly on the pinnacle of the steeple and sat there, then fell
off to cut lovely curves all around the cedars, then off like an arrow
to the south.
