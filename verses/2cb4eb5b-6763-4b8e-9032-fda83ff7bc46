Title: Indulgence
---
Straighten yourself and you will not stand steady;
Display yourself and you will not be clearly seen;
Justify yourself and you will not be respected;
Promote yourself and you will not be believed;
Pride yourself and you will not endure.

These behaviors are wasteful, indulgent,
And so they attract disfavor;
Harmony avoids them.
