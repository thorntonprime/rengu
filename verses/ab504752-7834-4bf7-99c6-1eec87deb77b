What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
I’d have you do it ever; when you sing.
I’d have you buy and sell so; so give alms;
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too; when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o’ the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so.
And own no other function; each your doing.
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.
