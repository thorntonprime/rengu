Title: Love's Fire
---
The fire that consumes all things was set by Suin.
The fire in me, dancing to youth’s music, was set by my parting lover.

O water, that flows in the Namgang River,
your swirling blue breast lulled Non’gae’s youth to sleep.
O Taedong River, circlm'g Nungna Island,
you cursed the heartlessness of Kyeworhyang.
I call you both out of poetic habit,
but you have no power to douse the scorching flame.
If you can put out the fire inside me,
why is your throat too choked to sing a lover’s song of yearning?
I see the flames blazing in your own heart that others don’t see.

When my lover’s tears join my cries,
I’ll use the first drop to extinguish my heart
  and the second to sprinkle upon your breast.
