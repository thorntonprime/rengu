Title: The Gift
---
You are the light that
fire-flames me and I am the dark
that still blames me.

You are the love that
help-holds me and I am the hate
that still scolds me.

You are the song that
pure-molds me, reminding me of love
that enfolds me.

You are the gift that
new-names me and shines as a light
that enflames me.
