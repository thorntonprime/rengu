In short, the Sûfîs are unanimous in recognizing the existence of
mortification and discipline, but hold that it is wrong to pay regard to
them. Those who deny mortification do not mean to deny its reality, but only
to deny that any regard should be paid to it or that anyone should be pleased
with his own actions in the place of holiness, inasmuch as mortification is
the act of Man, while contemplation is a state in which one is kept by God,
and a man’s actions do not begin to have value until God keeps him thus. The
mortification of those whom God loves is the work of God in them without
choice on their part; it overwhelms and melts them away; but the
mortification of ignorant men is the work of themselves in themselves by
their own choice： it perturbs and distresses them, and distress is due to
evil.
