    Title: Care of the Soul
By: Thomas Moore

It may help us, in those times of trouble, to remember that love is not
only about relationship, it is also an affair of the soul. Disappointments
in love, even hetrayals and losses, serve the soul at the very moment
they seem in life to be tragedies. The soul is partly in time and partly
in eternity. We might remember the part that resides in eternity when we
feel despair over the part that is in life.
