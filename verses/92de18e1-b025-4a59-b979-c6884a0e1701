Commentary: This section of Yâjnavalkyà is important for the later philosophy
  of music as an aid to devotion and spiritual realization (Raghavan).

By continuous practice of the Saman chants, in the prescribed manner and with
concentration of mind, a man attains the Supreme Brahman. The songs entitled
Aparanta, Ullopya, Madraka, Prakari, Auvenaka, Sarobindu, Uttara, the songs
called Rik, Gatha, Panika, the music compositions associated with Daksha and
Brahman, -- the practice of these is indeed liberation. He who knows the inner
meaning of the sound of the lute, who is expert in intervals and in modal
scales and knows the rhythms, travels without effort upon the way of
liberation.
