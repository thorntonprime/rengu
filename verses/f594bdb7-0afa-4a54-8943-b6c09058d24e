Why are certain material objects so treasured? A gem is virtually useless
and a gilded scabbard is no better than a plain one.

Man decides that gold is valuable because it is rare and enduring and
brilliant. He then thinks that if he possesses gold he, himself, will
become rare or unique, that his individual worth will endure, and that he
also will be considered a rather brilliant fellow. So obsessed he may
become with these foolish notions that in trying to obtain gold, he will
destroy the very life he is trying to embellish.

In the darkness of delusion the unenlightened believe that they can glorify
themselves by reflecting the qualities they have assigned to their
possessions. Those who live the enlightened life readily discern that the
qualities of an object are not transferred to its possessor. A heap of
treasures piled in their path will not obstruct their vision. They can see
right through them. Gold in the pocket is not gold in the character.
