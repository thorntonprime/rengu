Confucius said, "I once went on a mission to Ch'u, and as I was going
along, I saw some little pigs nursing at the body of their dead mother.
After a while, they gave a start and all ran away and left her, because
they could no longer see their likeness in her; she was not the same as
she had been before. In loving their mother, they loved not her body
but the thing that moved her body. When a man has been killed in battle
and people come to bury him, he has no use for his medals. When a man
has had his feet amputated, he doesn't care much about shoes. For both,
the thing that is basic no longer exists. When women are selected to be
consorts of the Son of Heaven, their nails are not pared and their ears
are not pierced. When a man has just taken a wife, he is kept in posts
outside [the palace] and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions. If
so much care is taken to keep the body whole, how much more in the case
of a man whose virtue is whole? Now Ai T'ai-t'o says nothing and is
trusted, accomplishes nothing and is loved, so that people want to turn
over their states to him and are only afraid he won't accept. It must
be that his powers are whole, though his virtue takes no form."
