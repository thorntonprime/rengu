Many a clever strategem did he there devise
Until at last he crushed the King of Go
And Kosen could have his revenge.
When by his aid Kosen had regained his realm
And wiped away the shame of Kwaikei,
As minister at Kosen’s court,
Duke Toshu could have wielded boundless power,
And gained highest honours and vast possessions.
Yet, since obedient to Heaven’s decree
“The wise man should retire
When fame is reached and great deeds done,”
Rowing a boat on the Five Lakes
He found contentment among mists and waters.
