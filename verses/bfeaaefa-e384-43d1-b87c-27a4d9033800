Without kâma (desire, enjoyment, love) a man has no wish for worldly profit
(artha), without kâma a man does not strive after the Good (dharma), without
kâma a man does not love; therefore kâma stands above the others (artha and
dharma). For the sake of kâma the Rishis even give themselves up to asceticism,
eating the leaves of trees, fruits, and roots, living on the air, and wholly
bridling their senses, and others bend all their zeal to the Vedas. ...
Traders, husbandmen, herdsmen, craftsmen, as also artists, and those that carry
out actions consecrated to the gods, give themselves up to their works because
of kâma. Others, again, take to the sea filled with kâma; for kâma has the
most varied forms; everything is steeped in kâma. No being ever was, or is, or
will be, higher than the being that is filled with kâma. It is the innermost
core (of the world), O king of righteousness; on it is founded dharma and
artha. As butter from sour milk, so kâma comes forth from artha and dharma. ...
Better is the flower and the fruit than the wood, kâma is more excellent than
artha and dharma. As honey is the sweet juice from the flower, so kâma is from
these two, according to the teaching of tradition. Kâma is the womb of dharma
and artha, and kâma makes up their essence. Without kâma the manifold workings
of the world would not be thinkable.
