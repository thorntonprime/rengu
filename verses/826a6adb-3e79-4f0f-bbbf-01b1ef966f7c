Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
If you speak of the Way and not of its sequence, then it is not a way;
and if you speak of a way that is not a way, then how can anyone make
his way by it? Therefore the men of ancient times who clearly
understood the Great Way first made clear Heaven and then went on to
the Way and its Virtue. Having made clear the Way and its Virtue, they
went on to benevolence and righteousness. Having made clear benevolence
and righteousness, they went on to the observance of duties. Having
made clear the observance of duties, they went on to forms and names.
Having made clear forms and names, they went on to the assignment of
suitable offices. Having made clear the assignment of suitable offices,
they went on to the scrutiny of performance. Having made clear the
scrutiny of performance, they went on to the judgment of right and
wrong. Having made clear the judgment of right and wrong, they went on
to rewards and punishments. Having made clear rewards and punishments,
they could be certain that stupid and wise were in their proper place,
that eminent and lowly were rightly ranked, that good and worthy men as
well as unworthy ones showed their true form, that all had duties
suited to their abilities, that all acted in accordance with their
titles. It was in this way that superiors were served, inferiors were
shepherded, external things were ordered, the inner man was trained.
Knowledge and scheming were unused, yet all found rest in Heaven. This
was called the Great Peace, the Highest Government. Hence the book
says, "There are forms and there are names." Forms and names were
known to antiquity, but the men of old gave them no precedence.
