  Title: Meister Eckhart

Realize this clearly,
that whatever leads you closest to this inner truth,
you are to follow in all you do.

Let your spirit be uplifted and not downcast,
burning and yet pure,
silent and quiet.

You need not say to God what you need or desire,
for God knows all that.

May we follow this peace and inward silence,
that the eternal Word may be spoken in us and understood,
and that we may be one with God -- Father, Word, and Spirit of both.

Amen.
