Title: Consider the Moon
---
Remember the moon as it wanes and fills
among the clouds,
at holy days.
Consider the moonï¼š it is closer
to the earth than any star or planet.
It pales in comparison to these.
Its light does not sparkle.
It's spotted, mottled.
Oceans wax and wane with the moon.
But the morning star,
how different,
is always present.
It is always and equally near,
shining in the sky before the sun
overwhelms us,
raised above earthly concerns
as your soul should be.
