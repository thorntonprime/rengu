When your heart becomes the grave of your secret, that desire of yours will
 be gained more quickly.
The Prophet said that any one who hides his inmost thought will soon be
 wedded to the object of his desire.
When seeds are hidden in the earth, their inward secret becomes the verdure
 of the garden.
If gold and silver were not hidden, how would they get nourishment (grow
 and ripen) in the mine?
