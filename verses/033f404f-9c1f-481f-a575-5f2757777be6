Look at the trees, look at the birds, look at the clouds, look at the
stars... and if you have eyes you will be able to see that the whole
existence is joyful. Everything is simply happy.  Trees are happy for no
reason; they are not going to become prime ministers or presidents and they
are not going to become rich and they will never have any bank balance.
Look at the flowers - for no reason. It is simply unbelievable how happy
flowers are.
