Title: The Capacity to Be Alone
---
Could there be a solitude that had no value to it? There is only one solitude;
it is vast and hard to bear. How often do we gladly exchange it for any kind
of sociability, however trivial and cheap, or trade it for the appearance
of agreement, however small, with the first person who comes along. But
those may be the very moments when your solitude can grow; its growing is
painful as the growing of boys and sad as the beginning of spring. But don't
be confused. All that is needed is the capacity to be alone with yourself,
to go into yourself and meet no one for hours-that is what you need to
achieve. To be alone, the way you were as a child, when the grown-ups walked
around so busy and distracted by matters that seemed important because they
were beyond your comprehension.
