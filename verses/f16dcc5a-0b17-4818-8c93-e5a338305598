Title: The Well of Grief
Format: verse
---
Those who will not slip beneath
  the still surface on the well of grief

turning downward through its black water
  to the place we cannot breathe

will never know the source from which we drink,
  the secret water, cold and clear,

nor find in the darkness glimmering
  the small round coins
    thrown by those who wished for something else.
