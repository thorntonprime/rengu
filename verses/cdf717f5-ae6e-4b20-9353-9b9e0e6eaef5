Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
So it is said, for him who understands Heavenly joy, life is the
working of Heaven; death is the transformation of things. In stillness,
he and the yin share a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share
a single flow. Thus he who understands Heavenly joy incurs no wrath
from Heaven, no opposition from man, no entanglement from things, no
blame from the spirits. So it is said, his movement is of Heaven, his
stillness of earth. With his single mind in repose, he is king of the
world; the spirits do not afflict him; his soul knows no weariness. His
single mind reposed, the ten thousand things submit - which is to say
that his emptiness and stillness reach throughout Heaven and earth and
penetrate the ten thousand things. This is what is called Heavenly joy.
Heavenly joy is the mind of the sage, by which he shepherds the world.
