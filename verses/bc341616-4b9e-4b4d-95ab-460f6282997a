Just as a flower gives out its fragrance to whomsoever approaches or uses it.
so love from within us radiates towards everybody and manifests as spontaneous
service. ... When we feed, clothe and attend on anybody, we feel like doing
all these things to our own body, for which we do not expect any return or
praise or commendation, because all bodies are our own; for, we as the
all-pervading Atman or Spirit reside in all bodies.
