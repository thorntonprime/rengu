Q： Is it possible that the Japa Yoga in itself can replace all other rites,
so that one can do just that to the exclusion of all others?

Ramdas： The object of all Sadhanas or practices is to maintain a continuous
remembrance of God. When Japa can do that, why should one do any other
Sadhana or rite? Japa is an all-inclusive and all-sufficient practice by
which you can be ever in tune with God and finally merge yourself in Him. It
is capable of taking you by itself to the highest goal of God-realisation.
