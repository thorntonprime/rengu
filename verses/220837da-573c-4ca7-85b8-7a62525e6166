The ancient Non-hon-shin-ga have handed down to us in songs, wi-gi-e,
ceremonial forms, symbols, the many things they learned of the mysteries that
surround us on all sides. All these things they learned through their power
of ‘wa-thi-gthon’, the power to search with the mind. They speak of the
light of the day by which the earth and all living things that dwell thereon
are influenced; of the mysteries of the darkness of night that reveal to us
all the great bodies of the upper world, each of which forever travels in
a circle of its own unimpeded by the others. ...

Many of the sayings of the Non-hon-shin-ga who lived long ago have come
down to us and have been treasured by the people as expressions coming from
men who have been in close touch with the mysterious power whom the people
had learned to worship and to reverence. Moreover, the men who uttered these
sayings had long since departed for the spirit land and were regarded by their
descendants as Wa-kon-da-gi, that is, sacred and mysterious persons. These
sayings had been transmitted in ritual form, and during the passage of years
had been jealously guarded against desecration by those persons who succeeded
in memorizing them and had taken care to teach them only to such pupils as
manifested a proper spirit of reverence for things sacred.
