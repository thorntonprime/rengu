Title: Kick Back and Say Ahhh
---
The mind just wants to stop giving a shit
about so many things.

It wants to kick back and say Ahhh more.

Not the kind of halfhearted ahhh one might
muster upon request if a doctor just stuck
a forklift down your throat.

There is a lot to a real Ahhh. I know you
know that, and thus

you have your scouts out looking for "them,"
basically 24-7. Yup, even in your dreams.

"Them," of course refers to Ahhhhhhhhhs.
