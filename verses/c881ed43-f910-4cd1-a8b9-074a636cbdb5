He (the musician) first uplifts his voice to laud the supreme King of the
universe, and comes down thereafter to those who hold their sovereignty after
His likeness. For this our kings themselves would wish, that the song should
come down step by step from heaven above, and that our praise of them should
be derived in due succession from the Power that has conferred on them their
victories. Let the musician then address his song to that most mighty King,
who is immortal, and reigns from all eternity; that primal Victor, from whom
all victories come to those who follow after.
