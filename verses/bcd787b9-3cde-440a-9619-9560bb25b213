Most holy Apostle, St. Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the Church
honors and invokes you universally, as the patron of hopeless cases, of
things almost despaired of. Pray for me, I am so helpless and alone. Make us
I implore you, of that particular privilege given to you, to bring visible
and speedy help where help is almost despaired of. Come to my assistance in
this great need that I may receive the consolation and help of Heaven in all
my necessities, tribulation, and sufferings, particularly (state request)
and that I may praise God with you and all the elect forever. I promise,
O blessed St. Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor, to always honor
you as my special and powerful patron, and to gratefully encourage devotion
to you. Amen.
