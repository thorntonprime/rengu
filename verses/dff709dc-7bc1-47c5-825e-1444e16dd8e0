Think not that God will be always caressing His children, or shine
upon their head, or kindle their hearts, as He does at the first. He
does so only to lure us to Himself as the falconer lures the falcon
with its gay hood. Our Lord works with His children so as to teach
them afterwards to work themselvesï¼š as He bade Moses to make the
tables of stone after the pattern of the first which He had made
Himself. Thus, after a time. God allows a man to depend upon himself,
and no longer enlightens, and stimulates, and rouses him. We must stir
up and rouse ourselves, and be content to leave off learning, and no
more enjoy feeling and fire, and must now serve the Lord with
strenuous industry and at our own cost
