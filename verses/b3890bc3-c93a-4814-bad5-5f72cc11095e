Title: Loyal to the Truth
---
The Truth is a Way and a Person -- and a Way and a Person have to be found
and followed. Truth is to be lived. There are, in fact, no simple Formulas
that will suffice once for all. True, there are principles. But a principle
is worthless if it is usually known and not applied. And if we apply it,
we have to have regard for circumstances that make the principle true in
a unique way in this unique case -- or that perhaps calls into action some
entirely different principle that gives the lie to the first.

How hard it is to be loyal to the Truth when most of the time you do not see
any of it! Thus loyalty demands constant criticism, constant rejection of
empty formulas, of words used to evade the struggle and to allay anguish,
rather than to find Truth or express it. And can we use words simply to
find Truth? Is this not an illusion?

There grows in me an immense dissatisfaction with all that is
merely passively accepted as truth, without struggle and without
examination. Faith, surely, is not passive, and not an evasion. And today,
more than ever, the things we believe, I mean especially the things we
accept on human faith -- reported matters of " fact,‚Äù questions of
history, of policy, of interpretation, of wants -- they should be very
few. In great spheres we should believe little or nothing, except what is
obviously and incontrovertibly true -- that the atomic bomb was dropped
on Nagasaki, for instance.
