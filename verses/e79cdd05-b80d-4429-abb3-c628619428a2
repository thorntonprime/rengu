Title: Jinniuâ€™s Bucket of Cooked Rice
---
Venerable Jinniu (Golden Ox), when every meal time
arrived, by himself in the front of the monks hall with the bucket of
cooked rice did a dance and, with guffaws of great laughter, said, Mr.
Bodhisattvas, come and eat the cooked rice.

Xuedou said, Although in this way, Jinniu
was not being good hearted.

A monk asked Changqing, The man of old said, Mr.
Bodhisattvas, come and eat the cooked rice. So what was his intended
aim?

Qing said, A great show causing celebration and praise
of the meal.

Xuedous ode says

Guffaws of laughter underneath the shadow of the white
cloud,

Holding on with both hands, he came handing it down and
giving it to them.

If are children of the golden-haired lion,

thousand li away.
