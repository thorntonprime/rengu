Without tracks,
No news.
The white clouds are rootless --
What color is the pure preeze?
Spreading the canopy of the sky, mindless,
Holding the carriage of the earth, powerful：
Illimining the profound source of a thoudsand ages,
Making patterns for ten thousand forms.
Meetings for enlightenment in the atoms of all lands --
  in each place is Samantabhadra：
The door of the tower opens -- everywhre is Maiteya.
