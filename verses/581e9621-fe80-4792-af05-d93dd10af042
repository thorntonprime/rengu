Men do not know themselves, and therefore they do not understand the things
of their inner world. Each man has the essence of God, and all the wisdom
and power of the world (germinally) in himself; he possesses one kind of
knowledge as much as another, and he Holiness who does not find that which
is in him cannot truly say that he does not possess it, but only 924 that
he was not capable of successfully seeking for it.
