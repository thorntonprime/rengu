    Title: The Seat of the Soul
By: Gary Zukav

Your soul is not a passive or a theoretical entity that occupies a space in
the vicinity of your chest cavity. It is a positive, purposeful force at the
core of your being. It is that part of you that understands the impersonal
nature of the energy dynamics in which you are involved, that loves without
restriction and accepts Without judgment.

If you desire to know your soul, the first step is to recognize that you have
a soul. The next step is to allow yourself to consider, â€œIf I have a soul,
what is my soul? What does my soul want? What is the relationship between
my soul and me? How does my soul affect my life?"

When the energy of the soul is recognized, acknowledged, and valued, it
begins to infuse the life of the personality. When the personality comes
fully to serve the energy of its soul, that is authentic empowerment. This
is the goal of the evolutionary process in which we are involved and the
reason for our being. Every experience that you have and will have upon the
Earth encourages the alignment of your personality with your soul. Every
circumstance and situation gives you the opportunity to choose this path,
to allow your soul to shine through you, to bring into the physical world
through you its unending and unfathomable reverence for and love of Life.
