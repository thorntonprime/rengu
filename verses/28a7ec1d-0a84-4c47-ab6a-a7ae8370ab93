Among all my patients in the second half of life -- that is to say, over
thirty-five -- there has not been one whose problem in the last resort
was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say
that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living
religions of every age have given their followers, and none of them have
been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook.
