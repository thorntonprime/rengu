Commentary: The trio of Being, Truth and Goodness rcalls the Hindu ternary
   Sat-Chit-Ananda.

We are taught in Metaphysicks, That Being, Truth and Goodness, are really one.
How sweet a rest now doth the Spirit, with its Understanding, and its Will,
find to it self in every Being, in every Truth, in every State or Motion of
Being, in every form of Truth. When it hath a sense of the highest Love, which
is the same with the highest Goodness, designing, disposing, working all in
all, even all Conceptions in all Understandings, all Motions, in every Will,
Humane, Angelical, Divine? With what a joy and complacency unexpressible doth
the Will, the Understanding, the whole Spirit now lie down to rest everywhere,
as upon a bed of Love, as in the bosom of goodness it self?
