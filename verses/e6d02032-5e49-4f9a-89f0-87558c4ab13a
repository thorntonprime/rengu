Title: I Never Quite Feel Right
Description: April 5
---
I never quite feel right until the effects of wine reach my head

and kick it back like a mule might whose hoofs just landed a clean
solid blow.

With my vision now corrected and aimed toward the heavens

and my ticket of intoxication firmly in hand for at least an hour,

there seem so many interesting possibilities that I wasnâ€™t fully aware
of before.
