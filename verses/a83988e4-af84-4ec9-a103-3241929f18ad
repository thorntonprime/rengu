Matohoshila took up an ear of corn, and at one end of it he pushed in
a stick, and at the other end of the ear he tied the plume of an
eagle. ...

\‘The tassel which grows upon the top of the ear of corn,’ Matohoshila
said, ‘and which we have represented here by the eagle plume,
represents the presence of the Great Spirit, for, as the pollen from
the tassel spreads all over, giving life, so it is with Wakan-Tanka,
who gives life to all things. This plume, which is alway on top of the
plant, is the first to see the light of the dawn as it comes, and it
sees also the night and the moon and all the stars. For all these
reasons it is very wakan (sacred). And this stick which I have stuck
into the ear of corn is the tree of life, reaching from Earth to
Heaven, and the fruit, which is the ear with all its kernels,
represents the people and all things of the universe. It is good to
remember these things if we are to understand the rites which are to
come.’
