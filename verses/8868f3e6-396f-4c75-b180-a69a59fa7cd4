Title: Prodigals Going Home
---
Yesterday afternoon, when Fr. Amadeus was preaching to us about the Holy
Ghost in the infirmary chapel, Fr. George came bursting in, made the sign
of“Thank you” three or four times, and departed. Last night he came
down and wandered around the monastery.

Reverend Father, who used to be the infirmarian, says that sometimes,
when they are near death, they get this urge to travel.

There was a Brother Mary up there who used to be the gatekeeper. He was
dying. He had a wooden leg and a cane. He used to take his cane and go
clumping around instead of staying in bed. They hid his wooden leg. He
found it behind the door, and put it on and got going. They hid it again,
in a closet Where he couldn’t find it. He lay in bed waving his hand
and making signs, “The cane! The cane!”

There was another Brother who was dying. It was summer, very hot. He
was in bed with very few clothes on. They found him walking out of the
infirmary with nothing on him but a shirt. “Where are you going?”
they asked him. “Nebraska!” he said. Nebraska is where he used to live.

I think I am beginning to understand something about the fifteenth chapter
of St. Luke’s Gospel -- the lost sheep, the lost drachma, the Prodigal
Son. Our dearest Lord is showing that He means everything about the fatted
calf and the rejoicing to be taken literally, and that He means to pour
out every kind of happiness in rivers upon those who ran away from His
mercy but could not escape it.
