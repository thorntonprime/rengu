Title: Yunmen's Bowl and Bucket
---
A monk asked Yunmen, "So what is the samadhi of all the
dusts?"

Men said, "Cooked rice in the bowl, water in the
bucket."

Cooked rice in the bowl; water in the bucket.

With many mouths playing up to the teacher, it is difficult to let down
a beak.

The positions of the Northern Bushel and the Southern Star
are not special.

The white billows flood the Sky, the flat Earth rises up.

Intending does not intend.

Stopping does not stop.

Each and every one is without pants, the children of those who excel.
