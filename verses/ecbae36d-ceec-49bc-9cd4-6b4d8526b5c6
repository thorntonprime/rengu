O ye who believe! When it is said unto you, Make room! in assemblies,
then make room; All창h will make way for you (hereafter). And when it
is said, Come up higher! go up higher; All창h will exalt those who
believe among you, and those who have knowledge, to high ranks. All창h
is Informed of what ye do.
