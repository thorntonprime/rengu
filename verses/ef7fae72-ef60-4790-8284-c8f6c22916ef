True perfection is not consistent with any terrene loves or worldly
affections： this mundane life and spirit which acts so strongly and
impetuously in this lower world, must be crucified： the soul must be
wholly dissolved from this earthy body in which it is so deeply
immersed, while it endeavours to enlarge its sorry tabernacle upon
this material globe, and by a holy abstraction from all things that
pinion it to mortality, withdraw itself and retire into a divine
solitude.
