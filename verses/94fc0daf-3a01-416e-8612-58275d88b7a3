When the messenger (of death) comes to take thee away, let him find
thee prepared.  Alas! thou wilt have no opportunity for speech, for
verily his terror will be before thee. Say not, ‘Thou art taking me in
my youth,’ for thou knowest not when thy death will take place. Death
comes and seizes the babe at the mother’s breast as well as the aged
man.  Observe this, for I speak unto thee good advice, which thou
shouldest ponder in thy heart.
