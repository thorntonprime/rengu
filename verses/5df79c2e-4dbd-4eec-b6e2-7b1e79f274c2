The Srutis would not have stated that the essential nature of the Self was in
no way connected with Vedic rites and conditions required by them such as a
particular class, and the rest, if they did not intend that those rites and
rajnopavita etc., their means, should be given up. Therefore, Vedic actions
which are incompatible with the knowledge of the identity of oneself with
the supreme Self should be renounced together with their means by one who
aspires after liberation; and it should be known that the Self is no other
than Brahman as defined in the Srutis.
