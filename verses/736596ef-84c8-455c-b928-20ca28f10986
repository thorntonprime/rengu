    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: WIth Silence or a Solitary Joy
---
Just as bees gather honey, so we collect from all that happens what is
sweetest -- and we build Him. Even with the littlest, most insignificant thing,
when it comes from love, we begin. We begin with effort and the repose that
follows efforts, with silence or a solitary joy, with everything we do alone
without anyone to join or help us, we begin Him whom we will not live to see,
any more than our ancestors could experience us. Yet they are in us, those long
departed ones, they are in our inclinations, our moral burdens, our pulsing
blood, and in gestures that arise from the depths of time.
