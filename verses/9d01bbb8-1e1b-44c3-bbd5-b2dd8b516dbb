What is important is to live a life without effort, without a single
problem. You can live without a problem if you understand the nature of
effort and see very clearly the whole structure of desire. Most of us have
a thousand problems, and to be free of problems we must be able to end each
problem immediately as it arises. It is absolutely necessary for the mind
to have no problems at all, and so live a life without effort. Surely such
a mind is the only religious mind, because it has understood sorrow and the
ending of sorrow. It is without fear, and is therefore a light unto itself.
