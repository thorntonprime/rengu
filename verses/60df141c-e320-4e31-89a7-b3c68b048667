\'Ali once asked the Prophet： ‘O Messenger of God, show me the shortest
road which leads to Paradise, the one most pleasing to the Lord and the one
best suited to his worshippers.’

The Prophet replied： ‘O 'Ali, this way is to repeat without cease the
name of God in seclusion (khalwah); so meritorious is this practice that the
world will not come to an end until no one on earth any longer performs it.’
