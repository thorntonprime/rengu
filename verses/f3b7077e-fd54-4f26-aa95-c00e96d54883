Though, in fact, the Dharma’s Truth cannot be expressed in words, teachers
talk on and on, trying to explain it. I suppose it’s just human nature to
say that something cannot be explained and then spend hours trying to
explain it. No wonder people walk away. Well, we could be more
entertaining. We could make up amusing stories and appeal to our audience
with flattering assurances. Of course, we’d just be piling illusion upon
illusion. But what would that have to do with the Dharma?
