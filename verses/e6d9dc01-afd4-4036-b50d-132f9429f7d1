He who is detached from life, when travelling on land does not meet
the rhinoceros or the tigerï¼š when going to a battle he is not
attacked by arms and weapons. The rhinoceros can find nowhere to drive
his horn; the tiger can find nowhere to put his claws; the weapons can
find nowhere to thrust their blades. Why is it so? Because he is
beyond the region of death.
