Pervading Heaven and earth that is the Way. Moving among the ten
thousand things that is Virtue. Superiors governing the men below
them that is called administration. Ability finding trained
expression that is called skill. Skill is subsumed in administration;
administration in duty ; duty in Virtue; Virtue in the Way; and the Way
in Heaven. Therefore it is said, those who shepherded the world in
ancient times were without desire and the world was satisfied, without
action and the ten thousand things were transformed. They were deep and
silent and the hundred clans were at rest. The Record says "Stick to
the One and the ten thousand tasks will be accomplished; achieve
mindlessness and the gods and spirits will bow down."
