Fear is perhaps the greatest enemy of candor. How many men fear to follow
their consciences because they would rather conform to the opinion of other
men than to the truth they know in their souls? How can I be sincere if I
am constantly changing my mind to conform with the shadow of what I think
others expect of me? Others have no right to demand that I be anything other
than what I ought to be in the sight of God.
