SENSES
Ah! Lady! Comest thou there
Then are we blinded,
So fiery is the glory of the Godhead
As thou well knowest...
Who may abide it, even one hour?

SOUL
Fish cannot drown in the water.
Birds cannot sink in the air,
Gold cannot perish
In the refinerâ€™s fire.
This has God given to all creatures
To foster and seek their own nature,
How then can I withstand mine?
  I must to God.
