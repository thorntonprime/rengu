Title: Everywhere
---
In the morning I put water in the basin to wash,
and you become the ripples caressing my reflection like a helpless child.
I wander the blooming hillside to forget my cares,
and you become the spring breeze lightly scenting my languid heart.
Unable to wait for you any longer, I lie in bed,
and you become a Silent, dark light tenderly covering my shame.

You are everywhere I look,
so I closed my eyes and searched above the clouds and beneath the seas.
You become a smile hidden in my mind;
kissing my closed eyes, you tease, “Can you see me?”
