I, who am thinking, have always existed, but not in myself or within the
limits of my own personality -- and not by an impersonal existence or life
either (for without personality there is no thought, and there must have been
thought there, since it is now in me); therefore I have always existed by
a suprapersonal existence or life. Where then? It must have been in a Being
of transcendent personality, in whom all that there is of perfection in my
thought and in all thought existed in a supereminent manner, and who was,
in His own infinite Self, before I was, and is, now while I am, more I than
I myself, who is eternal, and from whom I, the self which is thinking now,
proceeded one day into temporal existence. I had (but without being able
to say “I”) an eternal existence in God before receiving a temporal
existence in my own nature and my own personality.
