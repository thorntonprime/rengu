There are Christians that place and desire all their happiness in another life,
and there is another sort of Christians that desire happiness in this. The
one can defer their enjoyment of Wisdom till the World to come, and dispense
with the increase and perfection of knowledge for a little time; the other
are instant and impatient of delay, and would fain see that happiness here,
which they shall enjoy hereafter. ... For He offereth it now, now they are
commanded to have their conversation in Heaven, now they may be full of
joy and full of glory. Ye are not straitened in me, but in your own bowels
(II. Cor. VI. 12). Those Christians that can defer their felicity may be
contented with their ignorance.
