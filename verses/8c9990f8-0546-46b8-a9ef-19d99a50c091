Title: Layman Pang's Snow
---
Layman Pang bid adieu to Yaoshan. Shan ordered ten
people who were Zen travelers to go together to the main gate to see
him off. The Layman pointed to the snow in the middle of the sky and
said, "The excellent snow; flake by flake it does not fall at another
spot."

At that time there was Zen traveler Quan who asked, "At
what spot does it fall?"

The gentleman hit once with a slap.

Quan said, "A Layman too cannot get careless."

The gentleman said, "Like this you call yourself a Zen
traveler. Lao-tzu has not liberated your dependence."

Quan said, "Layman how do you make it alive?"

The gentleman again hit once with a slap and said, "The
eye sees like a blind person; the mouth speaks like a mute."

Xuedou separately said, "At the first questioning point,
yet grab a snowball then hit."

Xuedou's own ode, placing another hit, says

A trap.

Hit with a snowball, hit with a snowball.

The checkpoint of Elder Pang's function is unable to be grasped.

The superior person of Heaven does not personally know of the opening.

Inside of the eye, inside of the ear, decidedly easy-going.

Easy-going decidedly.

The blue-eyed barbarian monk is unable to differentiate.
