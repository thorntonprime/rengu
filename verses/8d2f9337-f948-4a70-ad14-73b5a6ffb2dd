  Title: The Man of Many Qualities

Many of you, I fancy, are wondering what on earth was my purpose in addressing
you on the subject of public safety, as if Athens were in danger or its
affairs in a shaky condition. On the contrary, it has more than two hundred
triremes, it is enjoying peace on land, and it is supreme at sea.

Furthermore, we have many allies who will aid us willingly in case of need,
and many more who pay us tribute and take our orders. In these circumstances
one might say that it is reasonable for us to feel confident, convinced that
dangers are remote, and for our enemies to stand in fear and deliberate on
the subject of their own safety.

If you use this line of reasoning, you feel scornful, I am sure, of what I
have come here to tell you, and you expect to dominate all Hellas by this
power of yours. On the contrary, these are the very reasons, as it happens,
that make me fearful, for in my experience the cities which think they are in
the best condition make the worst plans, those which are the most confident
find themselves faced with the greatest multitude of perils.

The cause of this is that neither good nor evil comes to men distinct and
unalloyed. Closely allied and concomitant with wealth and princely power
is folly, and along with folly comes licentiousness; but with poverty and
humility there are joined sobriety and temperance, so that it is hard to decide
which of the two portions one would consent to leave as heritage for his own
children. From that which is held to be more commonplace we may observe that
conditions generally tend in the direction of improvement, while from that
which on the surface appears preferable they habitually alter for the worse.
