Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
Here is a man who wants to take over the management of another man's
state." He thinks thereby to seize all the profits enjoyed by the kings
of the Three Dynasties, but fails to take note of their worries. This
is to gamble with another man's state, and how long can you expect to
gamble with his state and not lose it? Less than one man in ten
thousand will succeed in holding on to the state; the odds in favor of
losing it are more than ten thousand to one. It is sad indeed that the
possessors of states do not realize this!
