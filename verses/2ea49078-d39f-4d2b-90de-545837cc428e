Title: The Turning Of Heaven

\"I will tell you how the Three August Ones and the Five Emperors ruled
the world! They called it `ruling,' but in fact they were plunging it
into the worst confusion. The `wisdom' of the Three August Ones was
such as blotted out the brightness of sun and moon above, sapped the
vigor of hills and streams below, and overturned the round of the four
seasons in between. Their wisdom was more fearsome than the tail of the
scorpion; down to the smallest beast, not a living thing was allowed to
rest in the true form of its nature and fate. And yet they considered
themselves sages! Was it not shameful - their lack of shame!"
