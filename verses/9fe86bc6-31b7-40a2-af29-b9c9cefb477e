Title: To the Reader
---
Readers, I’m embarrassed to present myself as a poet to you.
As you read my poems, I know you’ll be disappointed,
  with good reason.
I don’t want your children to read them.
That would be like sitting in a flowering glade in late spring
  and rubbing a dry Chrysanthemum to one’s nose.

I don’t know how late the night is.
The heavy shadows over Mount So'rak are thinning.
As I wait for the dawn bell, I lay down my brush.
