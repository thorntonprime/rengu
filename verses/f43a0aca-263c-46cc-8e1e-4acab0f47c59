O man, do not be afraid of death at all.Thou art immortal. Death is not
the opposite of life. It is only a phase of life. Life flows on ceaselessly.
The fruit perishes but the seed is full of life. The seed dies but a huge
tree grows out of the seed. The tree perishes but it becomes coal which has
rich life. Water disappears but it becomes the invisible steam which contains
the seed of new life. The stone disappears but it becomes lime which is full
of new life. The physical sheath only is thrown but life persists.
