Do all you do,
acting from the core of your soul,
without a single "why."

If what you do is done
for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
or for God's sake,
or for eternal blessing,
then you still have ulterior motives.
You may be a good person,
but there is still a better way.

Because if you imagine that you can get God
with religious rituals and devotions,
or in sweet retreats or solitary prayers,
then you might as well think
you can purchase God at the market
and put him in a bag,
and keep him in your pantry.

To seek God in ritual
is to get the ritual and lose God,
for God hides beyond the ritual.

To seek God without artifice, though
is to take God as God is -- a person --
and this is Life itself.

Life is its own reason,
it springs from the Source,
and goes on and on,
without asking why --
it just is Life.

Thus if you are genuine,
and act uncalculating from the heart,
when asked, "Why do that?",
you will have only the reply,
"I do it because I do it!"

Where the creature ends,
there God begins.
God only needs you not to be an obstacle
to God being God.

The moment you get
your own ideas in your head,
God fades out.
When your ideas are gone,
then God streams in
and having forsaken yourself,
all that will remain
is invisible union with God,
for will, uncorrupted, is most free.

All things were created out of nothing,
and thus their origin is the "Not"
and the greatest exercise of free will
reaches its summit in willing nothing.
