Both he who is here in a person and who is yonder in the sun -- he is one.

He who knows this, on departing from this world, proceeding on to that self
which consists of food, proceeding on to that self which consists of breath,
proceeding on to that self which consists of mind, proceeding on to that
self which consists of understanding, proceeding on to that self which
consists of bliss, goes up and down these worlds, eating what he desires,
assuming what form he desires.
