Those men who are devoid of mind are merely led along in the train of
Destiny. They have no conception of anything incorporeal, and they do
not rightly understand the meaning of Destiny, that very power by
which they are led; they complain of the bodily discipline which she
imposes, and they do not recognize any other kind of happiness than
that which she confers.

Philosophers are above Destiny; for they find no joy in the happiness
she gives, since they hold pleasures in subjection; and they are not
harmed by the ills she inflicts, because they dwell at all times in
the immaterial world.
