Title: Learning the Scriptures Is Easy
---
Learning the scriptures is easy;
but living them, thatâ€™s hard.
Far easier to read words on a page
than to seek the living heart of things.

Stumbling through the fog of study,
I lost my last words --
and my vision cleared.

Oh the sight that met me then!
