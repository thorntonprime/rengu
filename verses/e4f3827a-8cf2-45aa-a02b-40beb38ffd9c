Highest good is like water.
Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending
 with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the
 way.

In a home it is the site that matters;
In quality of mind it is depth that matters;
In an ally it is benevolence that matters;
In speech it is good faith that matters;
In government it is order that matters;
In affairs it is ability that matters;
In action it is timeliness that matters.

It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.
