One man is identical with all and all with one. One religious practice is the
same as all others, and all others the same as any one of them. This is what
explains the experience of birth into the Pure Land by reliance upon Amida’s
power. All living beings are included in one thought. It is because of this
mutual intercommunication between all things, including the Buddhas themselves,
that if one but calls upon Amida’s sacred name once, it has the same virtue as
if he did it a million times.
