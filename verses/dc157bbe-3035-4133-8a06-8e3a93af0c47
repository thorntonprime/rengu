For since beings have only a participation in being, we now clearly see how we
arrive at God by eliminating that participation from all beings; once that is
suppressed there remains only entity in its infinite simplicity, which is the
essence of all beings. It is only by the most learned ignorance that the mind
grasps such an entity, for nothing seems to be left once I mentally remove all
that has participated being. For that very reason Denis the Great says that an
understanding of God is not so much an approach towards something as towards
nothing; and sacred ignorance teaches me that what seems nothing to the
intellect (mind) is the incomprehensible Maximum.
