Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal

There is left, there is right, there are theories, there are debates,
there are divisions, there are discriminations, there are emulations,
and there are contentions. These are called the Eight Virtues. As to
what is beyond the Six Realms, the sage admits its existence but does
not theorize. As to what is within the Six Realms, he theorizes but
does not debate. In the case of the Spring and Autumn, the record of
the former kings of past ages, the sage debates but does not
discriminate. So [I say] those who divide fail to divide; those who
discriminate fail to discriminate. What does this mean, you ask? The
sage embraces things. Ordinary men discriminate among them and parade
their discriminations before others. So I say, those who discriminate
fail to see.
