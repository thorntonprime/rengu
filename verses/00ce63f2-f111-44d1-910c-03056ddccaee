Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
The Master said The Way does not falter before the huge, is not
forgetful of the tiny; therefore the ten thousand things are complete
in it. Vast and ample, there is nothing it does not receive. Deep and
profound, how can it be fathomed? Punishment and favor, benevolence
and righteousness - these are trivia to the spirit, and yet who but the
Perfect Man can put them in their rightful place?
