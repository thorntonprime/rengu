Every form you see has its archetype in the placeless world;
If the form perished, no matter, since its original is everlasting.
Every fair shape you have seen, every deep saying you have heard,
Be not cast down that it perished; for that is not so.
Whereas the spring-head is undying, its branch gives water continually.
Since neither can cease, why are you lamenting?
Conceive the Soul as a fountain, and these created things as rivers：
While the fountain flows, the rivers run from it.
Put grief out of your head and keep quaffing this river water;
Do not think of the water failing; for this water is without end.
From the moment you came into the world of being,
A ladder was placed before you that you might escape.
First you were mineral, later you turned to plant,
Then you became animal： how should this be a secret to you?
Afterwards you were made man, with knowledge, reason, faith;
Behold the body, which is a portion of the dust-pit, how perfect it has
 grown!
When you have travelled on from man, you will doubtless become an angel;
After that you are done with this earth： your station is in heaven.
Pass again even from angelhood： enter that ocean,
That your drop may become a sea which is a hundred seas of'Oman.
Leave this'Son,'say ever'One'with all your soul;
If your body has aged, what matter, when the soul is young?
