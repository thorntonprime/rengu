Title: With That Moon Language
---
Admit something： Everyone you see, you say to them, “Love me.”
Of course you do not say this out loud; otherwise someone would call the cops.
Still, though, think about this, this great pull in us to connect.
Why not become the one who lives with a full moon in each eye
that is always saying, with that sweet moon language,
what every other eye in this world is dying to hear?
