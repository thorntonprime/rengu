Our acts in no way help to make God give or do to us anything
whatever. It is this idea our Lord would have his friends get rid of,
so he undermines their faith in it to make them trust in him alone who
intends bestowing largesse on them not for any reason but for love,
that he may be their comfort and their stay and that they, finding
that they themselves are really nothing, may admire in all the great
gifts of God. For the more void and passive the mind that falls on God
and is upheld by him, the deeper the man is gotten into God and the
more receptive is he to the precious gifts of God. Man must build on
God alone.
