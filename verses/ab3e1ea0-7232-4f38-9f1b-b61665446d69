    Title: Fourth Duino Elegy
Title: Who Shows a Child
---
Who shows a child his true world?
Who sets him among the stars, and places
in his hand the true measure of space?
Death can do this, the hugeness of death,
even before life has begun --
to hold it gently and feel no resentment,
that is enough.
