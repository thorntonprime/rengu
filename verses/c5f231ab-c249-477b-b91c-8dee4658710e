Of every ten who journey,
three are living, blind to death,
three are dying and find no life,
and those cascading unto death
while clinging still to life
are three as well.
They all engage in life-and-death.
Now one among the ten, they say,
is sure of life along the way.
He never hides from tigers
when walking in the mountains.
He never puts on armor
when walking into battle.
The tiger's claw, the enemy's blade,
they cannot penetrate or harm him,
for this one has no place for death to enter.
