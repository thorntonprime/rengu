Title: That Cute Hebrew
Description: May 9
---
Why complain about life if you are looking for good fish

and have followed some idiot into the middle of the copper market and then he
  left you there ... stunned and confused.

The above says a lot. It implies at some point you might actually have to
  start ... thinking.

Uh-oh.

Yes, uh-oh. And you better get ready. For evolution at some point will demand
it,

that your brain utilize more of its talents and operate on more of its
  cylinders -- the way Albertâ€™s did.

Einstein, I am talking about. Remember him? That cute Hebrew with wild hair.
