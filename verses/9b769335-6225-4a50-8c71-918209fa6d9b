God is not Outside this earthly case of ours. Therefore, exterior proof
is not of much avail, if any at all. We must ever fail to perceive Him
through the senses, because He is beyond them. We can feel Him, if we will
but withdraw ourselves from the senses. The divine music is incessantly
going on within ourselves, but the loud senses drown the delicate music,
which is unlike and infinitely superior to anything we can perceive or
hear with our senses.
