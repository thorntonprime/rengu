Nothing that exists perishes, but men are in error when they call the changes
which take place ‘destructions’ and ‘deaths’. ... The Father has never been
made, but ever is. But the Kosmos is ever being made. For the cause of the
existence of the universe is the Father： but the Father is the cause of his
own existence.
