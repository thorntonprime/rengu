The quality in which the Roman commonwealth is most distinctly superior,
is, in my judgment, the nature of its religion. The very thing that among
other nations is an object of reproach -- i. e., superstition -- is that
which maintains the cohesion of the Roman state. These matters are clothed
in such pomp, and introduced to such an extent into public and private life,
as no other religion can parallel. ... I believe that the government has
adopted this course for the sake of the common people. This might not have
been necessary had it been possible to form a state composed of wise men;
but as every multitude is fickle, full of lawless desires, unreasoned
passion, and violent anger, it must be held in by invisible terrors and
religious pageantry.
