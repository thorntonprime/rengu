I.

can you

see the face of the sky?

read the signs of the times?

gauge the tenor of thought?

discern the state of things within?

is there a storm brewing?
floods of fear
waves of rage
hateful righteousness
reaching a boiling point?

we are being called

not to be barometer
for world currents：
suggestion, projection,
manipulation

but to sift real
from unreal
to heed the
still small voice within

Elijah heard it
on the mountain
as he faced
wind
earthquake
fire

and right there --
he heard
the still small voice
of God

stilling the storm
lighting the dark --
peace breaking through

suddenly the world
is seen
as God sees：
safe, intact, assured.

II.

today,
instead of railing,
wondering,
blaming,
being transfixed
by portent of the times

we could,
like Elijah,
make our way higher,
find the center of our hearts --
not turn away,
but turn towards
the face of God

and there in some hush
an assurance --
insistent stillness --
hear, see, feel God, good
embracing the universe
in impartial, impervious
tenderness

here is where we see the face of the sky
discern the real signs of the times
storms find their stillness
fires burn but do not consume
the earth moves in wonder
all things are safe, intact, assured
everything about us
sings for joy.
