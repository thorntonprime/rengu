Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
Among the questions of T'ang to Ch'i we find the same thing. In the
bald and barren north, there is a dark sea, the Lake of Heaven. In it
is a fish which is several thousand li across, and no one knows how
long. His name is K'un. There is also a bird there, named P'eng, with a
back like Mount T'ai and wings like clouds filling the sky. He beats
the whirlwind, leaps into the air, and rises up ninety thousand li,
cutting through the clouds and mist, shouldering the blue sky, and then
he turns his eyes south and prepares to journey to the southern
darkness.
