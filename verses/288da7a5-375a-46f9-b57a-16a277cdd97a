A monk asked Zhaozhou, "'The Far-reaching Way is without
difficulty, only rejecting picking and choosing.' 'Just when there is
language there is picking and choosing.' So what is used for people,
Venerable?"

Zhou said "Why don't you quote these words to the end?"

The monk said, "I only recall up to this part."

Zhou said, "Only this, 'The Far-reaching Way is without difficulty,
only rejecting picking and choosing.'"
