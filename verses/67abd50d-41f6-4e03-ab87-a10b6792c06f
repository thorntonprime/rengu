Not only in the Kali-Yuga but in all ages, at all times, in all the worlds,
by the repetition of the Name of the Lord, men have crossed the ocean of
Samsara and attained to the highest eminence. In Kali-Yuga Nama-Japa is
particularly suited for oneâ€™s emancipation, just as meditation, performance
of sacrifices and worship of the Lord were suited in the other three Yugas,
for the attainment of Moksha. In this most troublesome Kali-age there is no
other Sadhana for emancipation.
