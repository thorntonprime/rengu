Title: Energy in Sounds
---
As many times as a parrot might say any number of things, will that make them
  true for the bird?

So it is with many utterances about spiritual matters from people; they just
  may never occur except in make-believe, which probably won't pay the rent.

Harness speech; let it become a windmill that can grind a harvest.

There is a pristine energy in sounds that come from certain depths that can
  help split the atom

if you can control them perfectly, which would mean your words cease to harm,
and always uplift, or at least comfort.

With the world so ripe for help, this is what our relationship is at times
  about --

me increasing your power, so that you can bake a special wheat, that can feed
  the various longings a refined heart can know.
