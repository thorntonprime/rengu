Title: Is It True?
---
Is it true? My love, don’t deceive me.
Did the ones who took you from me say, "You have no lover"?
Do you cry in secret, but in front of them change your tears to smiles?
It’s hard to endure tears, but to force them into smiles
 tastes more bitter than death.
Then I cannot help but defend myself.
I’ll pluck all the blossoms of my life, make a garland for your neck
 and shout,
“This is my lover’s beloved!”

Is it true? My love, don’t deceive me.
Did the ones who took you from me say, “We’ll find you a lover”?
Did you then protest, “I’ll remain alone”?
Then I cannot help but take revenge：
I’ll mix' my thi' blood with my hot tears,
 water their bloodthirsty sword and shout,
“This is my lover’s beloved!”
