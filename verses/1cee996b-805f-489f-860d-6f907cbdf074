All this world is nothing but the one Supreme Reality which is Niralamba,
devoid of any other support but Itself. The world shines by the light of
this Reality. Know that the Yogi, whose mind is turned inward, dissolves all
phenomenal objects, and merges himself in that Supreme Reality and becomes
one with It.
