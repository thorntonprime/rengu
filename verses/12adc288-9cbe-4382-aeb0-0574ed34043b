(The teacher) should keep his teaching within the bounds of the pupil’s
understanding. To give him what he cannot understand may scare him away, or
his mind may do violence to it. Muhammad said： 'No one ever gave information
to people who were not capable of understanding it without its proving a
temptation to some of them’; and Jesus said： 'Do not hang jewels on
the necks of swine'. A man of learning is not bound to tell all he knows
to everyone. But each is servant to the other according to the measure of
his intelligence.

To the pupil of limited ability should be given only what is clear and
suitable for him; nor should he be told that there are refinements which
are being held back from him. That would abate his desire for what is
clear, and confuse his heart by making him think that he is being stingily
dealt with. For naturally everyone thinks that he is fit for all kinds of
knowledge, and the more stupid he is the more he rejoices in the perfection
of his intellect. From this it follows that the convictions of the common
people should not be disturbed, because that would remove the barrier between
them and acts of disobedience. With them one should not plunge rashly into
the refinements of real knowledge, but should be content to teach them the
necessary acts of worship, and faithfulness in their occupations, without
raising doubts. The door of discussion should not be opened to the common
people, for that might cause them to forget their proper work on which the
continuance of life depends.
