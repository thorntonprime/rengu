Governing people and serving heaven Is like living off the land.
Living sparingly and responding quickly Means accumulating Te. There is
 nothing that cannot be overcome. There is no limit.
You can become the country And the country's mother, and nourish and extend
 it.
This is called deep roots, firm base. This is the Tao of living long and
 seeing far.
