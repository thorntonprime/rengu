By: St Alphonsus Liguori

Oh, the great folly of those who resist the will of God! They must of

accomplishment of the Divine decrees. They must suffer without
deriving any benefit from their trials. They cause themselves great
disquietude in this world and draw down upon themselves still greater
chastisements in the life to come.
