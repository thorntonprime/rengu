Title: Arriving at Rodin's Place in Meudon
---
He has received me, but that means nothing until I tell you how. Thusï¼š
the way a beloved place receives you on your return through many tangled
trails. A spring which you sang and lived for day and night while you were
gone. A grove over whose leafy canopies the birds cast shadows as they fly
back and forth. A path along the roses that never ceased to lead you where
you needed to go. And like a great dog did he receive me, recognizing me
with peaceable, caressing eyes. And like an eastern god, moving only from
within his noble calm, and with the smiles of a woman and the eager hands
of a child. And he led me around to see the gardens and houses and studios.
