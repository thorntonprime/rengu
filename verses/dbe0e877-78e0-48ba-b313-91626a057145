\"A very good question," said Ch'u Po-yu. "Be careful, be on your guard,
and make sure that you yourself are in the right! In your actions it is
best to follow along with him, and in your mind it is best to harmonize
with him. However, these two courses involve certain dangers. Though
you follow along, you don't want to be pulled into his doings, and
though you harmonize, you don't want to be drawn out too far. If in
your actions you follow along to the extent of being pulled in with
him, then you will be overthrown, destroyed, wiped out, and brought to
your knees. If in your mind you harmonize to the extent of being drawn
out, then you will be talked about, named, blamed, and condemned. If he
wants to be a child, be a child with him. If he wants to follow erratic
ways, follow erratic ways with him. If he wants to be reckless, be
reckless with him. Understand him thoroughly, and lead him to the point
where he is without fault.
