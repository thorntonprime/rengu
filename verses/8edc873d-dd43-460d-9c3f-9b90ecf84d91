There are two aspects of Râdhâ-Krishna： the Absolute and the Relative. They
are like the sun and its rays. The Absolute may be likened to the sun, and the
Relative to the rays.

A genuine bhakta dwells sometimes on the Absolute and sometimes on the
Relative. Both the Absolute and the Relative belong to one and the same
Reality. It is all one -- neither two nor many.
