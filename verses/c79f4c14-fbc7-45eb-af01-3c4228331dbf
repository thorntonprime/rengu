Title: A Task to Spiritualize the World
---
he task of a priest is to spiritualize the world. He raises his consecrated
hands, and the grace of Christâ€™s resurrection goes out from him to
enlighten the souls ofthe elect and of them that sit in darkness and
the shadow of death.Through his blessing material creation is raised up
and sanctified and dedicated to the glory of God.The priest prepares the
coming of Christ by shedding upon the whole world the invisible light that
enlightens every man that comes into the world.Through the priest the glory
ofChrist seeps out into creation until all things are saturated in prayer.

All week I have been thinking of the inestimable greatness and dignity
of faith. Faith is higher and more perfect than all knowledge that
is accessible to us on earth.The only really valuable experience is a
deepening and intensification of faith by love and the gifts of the Holy
Ghost -- an intensification that only simplifies our faith and makes it
more clear by purifying it of every created image and species. So that
the purest experience of all begins with the realization of how far faith
transcends experience. Our only true greatness is in the humility of living
faith.The simpler and purer our faith is, the closer it brings us to God,
Who is infinitely great. That is why everyone who humbles himself shall
be exalted, and everyone who exalts himself, in the appetite for great
lights and extraordinary experiences and feelings and mystical consolations,
shall be humbled. Because the richer he desires to be in these things, the
poorer he will be in the sight of God, in Whose eyes greatness is nothing.
