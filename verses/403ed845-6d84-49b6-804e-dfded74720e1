I revealed my wisdom first to Brahmâ in the form of the Vedas. Brahmâ
declared that wisdom unto his son Manu, from whom the seven patriarchs and
sages -- Bhrigu and the others -- received it. From them it passed on to
their sons and disciples, who, being of various temperaments and natures,
understood it variously. Thus arose the several interpretations of the Vedas.
