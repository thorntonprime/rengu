The easy path is always so appealing. So why do I prefer the hard way? On
the easy path we take things for granted. We get lazy and bored. This is a
formula for trouble and loss. When we go the hard way, we know we canâ€™t let
our guard down for a moment. We have to stay alert to meet the challenges.
Solving problems makes our mind keener and our character stronger. This is
achievement! This is true gain!
