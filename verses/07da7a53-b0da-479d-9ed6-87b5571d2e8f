Ch'eng of North Gate said to the Yellow Emperor, "When Your Majesty
performed the Hsien-ch'ih music in the wilds around Lake Tung-t'ing, I
listened, and at first I was afraid. I listened some more and felt
weary, and then I listened to the end and felt confused. Overwhelmed,
speechless, I couldn't get hold of myself."
