Description: Instructions for addressing a person shortly after death
---
The body which thou hast now is called the thought-body of
propensities. Since thou hast not a material body of flesh and blood,
whatever may come -- sounds, lights, or rays -- are, all three, unable
to harm thee： thou art incapable of dying. It is quite sufficient for
thee to know that these apparitions are thine own thought-forms.
Recognize this to be the Bardo.

O nobly-born, if thou dost not now recognize thine own thought-forms,
whatever of meditation or of devotion thou mayst have performed
while in the human world -- if thou hast not met with this present
teaching -- the lights will daunt thee, the sounds will awe thee, and
the rays will terrify thee. Shouldst thou not know this all-important
key to the teachings -- not being able to recognize the sounds,
lights, and rays -- thou wilt have to wander in the Sangsâra.
