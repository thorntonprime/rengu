The Prayer of my heart gave me such consolation that I felt there was no
happier person on earth than I, and I doubted if there could be greater and
fuller happiness in the kingdom of Heaven. Not only did I feel this in my
own soul, but the whole outside world also seemed to me full of charm and
delight. Everything drew me to love and thank God people, trees, plants,
animals. I saw them all as my kinsfolk. I found on all of them the magic of
the Name of Jesus. Sometimes I felt as light as though I had no body and
was floating happily through the air instead of walking. Sometimes when I
withdrew into myself I ... was filled with wonder at the wisdom with which
the human body is made.
