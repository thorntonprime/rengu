And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for
they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of
the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto you.
They have their reward.

But thou, when thou prayest. enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
