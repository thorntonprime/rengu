To him who knows the Truth comes the realisation：--

‘I am Brahman; I have no suffering and no joy; I neither long for anything,
nor do I renounce anything; I am blue, I am yellow, I am white; I am in
grass, leaves, trees and flowers; I am the hills, the streams, dales and
peaks; I am the essence of all. When all imagination and feelings are gone,
then I am the transcendental Reality. The immutable, the nameless and the
formless, am I; I am the Witness-Self; 1 am the basis of all experience;
I am the light that makes experience possible.

‘I am the man who has fallen in love with a young woman and who compares
her beauty to the moon; the consciousness which illumines the joy in the
heart of a lover, am 1.1 am the taste in the dates. Gain and loss are the
same to me. As the string bearing the beads remains hidden, so I am the
Reality which is hidden in all beings.

'I worship the Atman which is the essence of living beings, the sweetness
in the moon, and the splendour in the sun.’
