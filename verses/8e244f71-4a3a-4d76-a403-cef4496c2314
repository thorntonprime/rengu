The Revelation of the Scripture is from Allâh, the Mighty, the Knower,

The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of repentance, the Stern in punishment,
the Bountiful. There is no God save Him. Unto Him is the journeying.

None argue concerning the revelations of Allâh save those who disbelieve,
so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee.
