He drank off a glass of tea and began in a calmer voice.

“Well, then. My patient kept getting worse and worse. You are not a
doctor, my good sir; you cannot understand what passes in a poor fellow’s
heart, especially at first, when he begins to suspect that the disease is
getting the upper hand of him. What becomes of his belief in himself? You
suddenly grow so timid; it’s indescribable. You fancy then that you have
forgotten everything you knew, and that the patient has no faith in you,
and that other people begin to notice how distracted you are, and tell you
the symptoms with reluctance; that they are looking at you suspiciously,
whispering ... Ah! it’s horrid! There must be a remedy, you think,
for this disease, it one could find it. Isn’t this it? You try -- no,
that’s not it. You don’t allow the medicine the necessary time to
do good ... You clutch at one thing, then at another. Sometimes you take
up a book of medical prescriptions -here it is, you think! Sometimes, by
Jove, you pick one out by chance, thinking to leave it to fate. ... But
meantime a fellow-creature’s dying, and another doctor would have saved
him. ’We must have a consultation.’ you say; ’I will not take the
responsibility on myself.’ And what a fool you look at such times! Well,
in time you learn to bear it; it's nothing to you. A man has died --
but it’s not your fault; you treated him by the rules.”
