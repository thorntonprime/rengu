\"In ancient times Yao abdicated in favor of Shun and Shun ruled as
emperor; K'uai abdicated in favor of Chih and Chih was destroyed.
T'ang and Wu fought and became kings; Duke Po fought and was wiped
out. Looking at it this way, we see that struggling or giving way,
behaving like a Yao or like a Chieh, may be at one time noble and at
another time mean. It is impossible to establish any constant rule.
