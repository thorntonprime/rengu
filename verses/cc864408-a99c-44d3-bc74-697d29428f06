Meditate upon, consider, and weigh deeply the serious facts contained
in the biographies of previous saintly lives, the law of karma, the
inconveniences and miseries of all sangsâric states of existence, the
difficulties of obtaining the boon of a well-endowed human life, and
the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the exact time of death;
and, having weighed these in your minds, devote yourselves to the
study and practice of the mantrayânic doctrines.
