Title: Law of Causality
---
You’re breaking our promise and leaving.
How much truth did it have?
I can’t accept this parting.
I know this parting will return to that promise.
This is the inviolate law of causality.
When you leave, I’ll wait for your returning kiss to come
  before your parting kiss has dried.

I know there’s no malice in your leaving
and your broken promise.
Even if you never quit this separation,
  my lips touched yours and will never know another.
