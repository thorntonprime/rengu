The wise have no fixed opinion.
They take the peoples’ opinion as their own.
Those who are good I treat as good.
Those who are bad I treat as good.
That’s the perfection of goodness.
Those who are honest I treat as honest.
Those who are dishonest I treat as honest.
That’s the perfection of honesty.
Among the people the wise reserve their opinion
And live in harmony with them.
The multitude satisfy their eyes and ears,
And the wise treat them as little children.
