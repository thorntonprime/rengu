Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this.
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery.
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence： the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature.
And master ev’n the devil or throw him out
With wondrous potency.
