For of all paines the most grevious paine,
Is for one faile to beginn all againe.
  Every man shall greate Paine have
When he shall first this A rte covet and crave,
He shall oft tymes Chaunge his desire.
With new tydings which he shall heare;
His Councell shall oftentimes him beguile.
For that season he dreadeth noe subtile wile：
And oftentymes his minde to and fro,
With new Oppinions he shall chaunge in woe：
And soe long tyme continue in Phantasie,
A greate adventure for him to come thereby：
Soe of this Arte be ye never so saine.
Yet he must taste of manie a bitter paine.
