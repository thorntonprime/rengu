Title: Three Things Keeping You from Home
---
There are only three things that keep me
away from my true home.
Hear this, Eckhart!
Don't fuss over that body of yours.
Will the one thing that matters.
And cease your loving of what fades away.
Then and only then
will you see and know the spirit, peace,
and oneness of God.
