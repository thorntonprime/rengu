Title: Dasui's Aeon Fire
---
A monk asked Dasui, "In the void of the Aeon Fire, most
certainly the great many thousands are altogether destroyed, but I have
not yet discerned if this one is destroyed or not destroyed?"

Sui said, "Destroyed."

The monk said, "In this way then, it follows the other is
gone too."

Sui said, "It follows the other is gone."

In the center of the light of the fire kalpa is the cause of setting up
a question.

The patch-robed monk is as if blocked by two difficult checkpoints.

One may sympathize with the words of the one phrase "it follows the
other..."

Discriminations and discriminations for 10,000 miles -- solitary, the
going and returning.
