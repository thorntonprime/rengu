As long as men in high places covet knowledge and are without the Way,
the world will be in great confusion. How do I know this is so?
Knowledge enables men to fashion bows, crossbows, nets, stringed
arrows, and like contraptions, but when this happens the birds flee in
confusion to the sky. Knowledge enables men to fashion fishhooks,
lures, seines, dragnets, trawls, and weirs, but when this happens the
fish flee in confusion to the depths of the water. Knowledge enables
men to fashion pitfalls, snares, cages, traps, and gins, but when this
happens the beasts flee in confusion to the swamps. And the flood of
rhetoric that enables men to invent wily schemes and poisonous
slanders, the glib gabble of "hard" and "white," the foul fustian of
"same" and "different" bewilder the understanding of common men. So
the world is dulled and darkened by great confusion. The blame lies in
this coveting of knowledge.
