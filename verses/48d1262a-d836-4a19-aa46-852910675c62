O ye who believe! Remember Allâh’s favour unto you when there came
against you hosts, and We sent against them a great wind and hosts ye
could not see. And Allâh is ever Seer of what ye do.

When they came upon you from above you and from below you. and when
eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats, and ye were
imagining vain thoughts concerning Allâh.

There were the believers sorely tried, and shaken with a mighty shock.

And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were
saying： Allâh and His messenger promised us naught but delusion.
