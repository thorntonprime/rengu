Once we start our work, it's heart in hand;
all that's to be done to serve these folks
is more than even a strong man can handle.
There's no way to avoid the dirty work,
so let us go and make our visits,
just yesterday to mourn Hsu Wu,
today to see Liu San to the graveside.
Day after day, no rest,
sad, and harried as a housewife.
