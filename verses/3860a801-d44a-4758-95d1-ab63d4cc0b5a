The world gave thee false clues, like a ghoul：
Thou took'st no heed of the clue, but wentest to that which is without a
 clue.
Since thou art now the sun, why dost thou wear a tiara,
Why seek a girdle, since thou art gone from the middle?
I have heard that thou art gazing with distorted eyes upon thy soul：
Why dost thou gaze on thy soul, since thou art gone to the soul of Soul?
O heart, what a wondrous bird art thou, that in chase of divine rewards
Thou didst fly with two wings to the spear-point, like a shield!
The rose flees from autumn- O what a fearless rose art thou
Who didst go loitering along in the presence of the autumn wind!
Falling like rain from heaven upon the roof of the terrestrial world
Thou didst run in every direction till thou didst escape by the conduit.
Be silent and free from the pain of speech： do not slumber,
Since thou hast taken refuge with so loving a Friend.
