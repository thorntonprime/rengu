If we had attained the full vision of Truth, we would no longer ber mere
seekers, but would have become one with God, for Truth is God. But being only
seekers we prosecute our quest and are conscious of our imperfection. And
if we are imperfect ourselves, religion as conceived by us must also
be imperfect.
