  - Life-Love=Love=God's Love for Us
By: William Law
---
Love is my bait; you must be caught by it; it will put its hook into your heart
and force you to know that of all strong things nothing is so strong, so
irresistible, as divine love.

It brought forth all the creation; it kindles all the life of Heaven; it is the
song of all the angels of God. It has redeemed all the world; it seeks for
every sinner upon earth; it embraces all the enemies of God; and from the
beginning to the end of time the one work of Providence is the one work of
love.
