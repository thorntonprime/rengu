Don't glorify heroes, And people will not contend.
Don't treasure rare objects, And no one will steal.
Don't display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore, the Sage rules By emptying hearts and filling bellies, By
 weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; Leads people Away from
 knowing and wanting;
Deters those who know too much From going too farï¼š
Practices non-action And the natural order is not disrupted.
