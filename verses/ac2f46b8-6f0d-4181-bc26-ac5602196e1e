Title: Secrets
---
Secrets? Secrets, you say. What kind of secrets would I have?
I tried to keep a secret from you, but it couldnâ€™t be guarded.

Through my tears my secret entered your eyes.
Through my breath my secret entered your ears.
Through my beating heart, my secret entered your touch.
Another secret became a splinter of red heart and entered your dream.

There is one last secret.
This secret is like a soundless echo and cannot be expressed.
