And then our Lord opened my spiritual eye and shewed me my soul in midst of
my heart. I saw the Soul so large as it were an endless world, and as it were
a blissful kingdom. And by the conditions that I saw therein I understood
that it is a worshipful City. In the midst of that City sitteth our Lord.
