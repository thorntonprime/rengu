I have been freed from effort and search, I have tied my sleeve to the skirt
 of God.
If I am flying, I behold the place to which I soar; and if I am circling,
 I behold the axis on which I revolve;
And if I am dragging a burden, I know whither： I am the moon, and the Sun
 is in front of me as the guide.
