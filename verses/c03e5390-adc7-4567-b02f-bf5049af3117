This world is God’s house, wherein a gallant sumptuous feast is
prepared, and all men are his guests： and ... there are two waiters
at the table which fill out the wine to them that call for it： the
one a man, the other a woman： the one called Novs. or mind, from
whose hand all wise men drink, the other Aupáreia, or intemperance,
who fills the cups of the lovers of this world.
