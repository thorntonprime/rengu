Title: The Hermitage Master’s Tiger’s Roar
---
A monk arrived at the place of the hermitage master of
Paulownia (Empress Tree) Peak and immediately asked, Here inside, if
you suddenly run into a tiger, again how would you make it alive?

The Hermitage Master immediately made a tigers roar.

The monk immediately made gestures of fear.

The Hermitage Master burst out great laughter.

The monk said, This old thief.

The Hermitage Master said, How this old monk endures
contention.

The monk gave up and left.

Xuedou said, Indeed, by the standard both are each wicked
thieves, only free to steal the hand bell by covering their ears.
