\"The man of Virtue rests without thought, moves without plan. He has no
use for right and wrong, beautiful and ugly. To share profit with all
things within the four seas is his happiness, to look after their needs
is his peace. Sad-faced, he's like a little child who has lost his
mother. Bewildered, he's like a traveler who has lost his way. He has
more than enough wealth and goods, but he doesn't know where they come
from. He gets all he needs to eat and drink, but he doesn't know how he
gets it. This is called the manner of the man of Virtue."
