When one reaches the state of the thoughtless thought, one thinks that he
is awakened to the Dharma. He thinks about his meditation experience and
how it will change his thoughts about his environment. He thinks that it is
absolutely wonderful that he has controlled his mind. It wouldnâ€™t be right
to say that he has more to think about. Actually, he has less.
