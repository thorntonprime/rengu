Look at the facts of the world. You see a continual and progressive
triumph of the right. I do not pretend to understand the moral universe,
the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways. I cannot calculate
the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine
it by conscience. But from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.

Things refuse to be mismanaged long. Jefferson trembled when he thought of
slavery and remembered that God is just. Ere long all America will tremble.
