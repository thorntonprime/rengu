Title: Our Responsibility Toward Creation
---
\“Obedient unto death. ... ” Perhaps the most crucial aspect of
Christian obedience to God today concerns the responsibility of the
Christian in a technological society toward God’s creation and God’s
will for His creation. Obedience to God’s will for nature and for
man -- respect for nature and for man -- in the awareness of our power to
frustrate God’s designs for nature and for man -- to radically corrupt
and destroy natural goods by misuse and blind exploitation, especially by
criminal waste. The problem of nuclear war is only one facet of an immense,
complex and unified problem.

There are very grave problems in the implications of certain kinds of
Christian outlooks on “the world.”The crux of the matter seems to
be to what extent a Christian thinker can preserve his independence
from obsessive modes of thought about secular progress. (Behind which
is always the anxiety for us and for the Church to be “acceptable”
in a society that is leaving us behind in a cloud of dust.) In other
words, Where is our hope? Ifin fact our hope is in a temporal and secular
humanism of technological and political progress, we will find ourselves,
in the name of Christ, joining in the stupidity and barbarism of those
who are despofling His creation in order to make money or get power for
themselves. But our hope must be in God. And he who hopes in God will find
himself sooner or later making apparently hopeless and useless protests
against the barbarism of power.
