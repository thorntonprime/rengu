Everyone should be his own physician. We ought to assist and not force
nature. Eat with moderation what agrees with your constitution. Nothing is
good for the body but what we can digest. What medicine can produce
digestion? Exercise. What will recruit strength? Sleep. What will alleviate
incurable ills? Patience.
