Title: Flame My Life
---
Teach me the humility of Mowing
that nothing I can do can grasp

the love that is Your one and ever
hidden work, and let me in my

darkness come to see this nothing
as the radiance that burns until

it finally blinds me, and so flame
my life with the radiance of love

until I finally see.
