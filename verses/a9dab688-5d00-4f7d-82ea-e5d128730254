What you can look at and see are forms and colors; what you can listen
to and hear are names and sounds. What a pity! - that the men of the
world should suppose that form and color, name and sound are sufficient
to convey the truth of a thing. It is because in the end they are not
sufficient to convey truth that "those who know do not speak, those who
speak do not know."  But how can the world understand this!
