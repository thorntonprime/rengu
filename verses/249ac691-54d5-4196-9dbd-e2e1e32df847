The basis of spiritual ascent is that God is pure Spirit and that man
resembles Him fundamentally through the intelligence; man goes towards God by
means of that which is, in him, most conformable to God -- the intellect --
which is at the same time both penetration and contemplation and has as its
“supernaturally natural” content the Absolute which illumines and delivers.
The character ofa way depends on a particular preliminary definition of man：
if man is defined as passion, as the general perspective of Christianity
would have it -- though there is here no principal restriction -- then the
way is suffering; if as desire, then the way is renunciation; if as will,
then the, way is effort; if as intelligence, then the way is discernment,
concentration, contemplation.
