Title: There Is a Wonderful Game
---
There is a game we should play, and it goes like thisï¼š

We hold hands and look into each other's eyes and scan each other's
face.

Then I say, "Now tell me a diff erence you see between us."

And you might respond, "Hafiz, your nose is ten times bigger than
mine!"

Then I would say, "Yes, my dear, almost ten times!"

But let's keep playing. Let's go deeper, go deeper.

For if we do, our spirits will embrace and interweave,

our union will be so glorious that even God will not be able to tell
us apart.

There is a wonderful game we should play with everyone and it goes, it
goes like this. ...
