Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know.
Block the passage Bolt the gate Blunt the sharp Untie the knot Blend with
 the light Become one with the dust - This is called original unity.
It can't be embraced It can't be escaped, It can't be helped It can't be
 harmed, It can't be exalted It can't be despised, Therefore it is revered
 under Heaven.
