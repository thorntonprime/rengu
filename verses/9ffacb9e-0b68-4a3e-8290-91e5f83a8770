Title: How Almighty God will goodly answer for all those that for the
  excusing of themselves list not leave their business about the love
  of Him.
---
And therefore me thinketh, that they that set them to be contemplatives
should not only have active men excused of their complaining words, but
also me thinketh that they should be so occupied in spirit that they should
take little heed or none what men did or said about them. Thus did Mary,
our example of all, when Martha her sister complained to our Lord： and if
we will truly do thus our Lord will do now for us as He did then for Mary.

And how was that? Surely thus. Our lovely Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom no
privy thing is hid, although He was required of Martha as doomsman for to
bid Mary rise and help her to serve Him; nevertheless yet, for He perceived
that Mary was fervently occupied in spirit about the love of His Godhead,
therefore courteously and as it was seemly for Him to do by the way of reason,
He answered for her, that for the excusing of herself list not leave the
love of Him. And how answered He? Surely not only as doomsman, as He was of
Martha appealed： but as an advocate lawfully defended her that Him loved,
and said, “Martha, Martha!” Twice for speed He named her name; for He would
that she heard Him and took heed to His words. “Thou art full busy,” He
said, “and troubled about many things.” For they that be actives behove
always to be busied and travailed about many diverse things, the which them
falleth, first for to have to their own use, and sithen in deeds of mercy
to their even-christian, as charity asketh. And this He said unto Martha,
for He would let her wit that her business was good and profitable to the
health of her soul. But for this, that she should not think that it were the
best work of all that man might do, therefore He added and said： ‘But
one thing is necessary.’

And what is that one thing? Surely that God be loved and praised by Himself,
above all other business bodily or ghostly that man may do. And for this,
that Martha should not think that she might both love God and praise Him
above all other business bodily or ghostly, and also thereto to be busy about
the necessaries of this life： therefore to deliver her of doubt that she
might not both serve God in bodily business and ghostly together perfectly --
imperfectly she may, but not perfectly -- He added and said, that Mary had
chosen the best part; the which should never be taken from her. For why,
that perfect stirring of love that beginneth here is even in number with
that that shall last without end in the bliss of heaven, for all it is but one.
