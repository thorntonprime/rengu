What do people strive for? Money, or fame, or successful relationships, or
the Dharma. Well, one man may become very rich but be hated by his family.
Another man may be loved by everyone but not have a penny to his name.
Still a third man may be hailed as a hero by his countrymen and then find
himself with neither funds nor loving family. Usually, so much effort is
put into achieving one goal, that the other goals cannot be attained. But
what about the man who strives to attain the Dharma? If he succeeds he has
gained in that one goal far more than the other three combined. He who has
Dharma lacks nothing.
