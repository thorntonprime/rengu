O nobly-born (so and so by name), the time hath now come for thee to seek
the Path (in reality). Thy breathing is about to cease. Thy guru hath set
thee face to face before with the Clear Light; and now thou art about to
experience it in its Reality in the Bardo state, wherein all things are
like the void and cloudless sky, and the naked, spotless intellect is like
unto a transparent vacuum without circumference or centre. At this moment,
know thou thyself; and abide in that state.
