Title: A Day Too Great to Force
---
Look how the Creator in the form of a mother or father can then love
the created, a child, even more than themselves.

Look at the salvation and purpose a person can find in that devotion
of caring.

A day is too great a force to bear without the heart open.

Time will slay your body no matter what, but with love the impetus of
your final movements will make eloquent your demise.

Could God care for the created more than He cares for Himself?

The soul, and I think any being, really wants to love, more than be
loved.
