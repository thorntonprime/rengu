Title: Don't Look Shortchanged
---
You can return to Springtime whenever you want.

And your greatest pleasures, don't let their memory ever fade; let
them be as they should, a genuine guide and friend,

ever there to take you back again to what made you happy once -- or
brought you deeper into the Heart.

Wanting to be other than where you are -- who cursed you like that?
Break that spell.

Wherever you might wind up after your body is buried, cremated, left
at the Tower of Silence, or set floating down the Ganges,

anywhere your soul might someday call home, come to your senses -- you
carry that inside now, so don't look shortchanged.

Things can only appear dismal until that one eye opens and the
sacred flame makes you squint.

You can return to the Divine Season at a flex of your will's might,
and be the luminous sphere in the sky, raining on us, as it does.
