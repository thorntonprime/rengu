Were I indeed to define divinity, I should rather call it a divine life, than a
divine science-, it being something rather to be understood by a spiritual
sensation, than by any verbal description. ... Divinity indeed is a true efflux
from the eternal light, which, like the sun beams, does not only enlighten, but
heat and enliven; and therefore our Saviour hath in his beatitudes connected
purity of heart with the beatifical vision. And as the eye cannot behold the
sun, unless it be sunlike, and hath the form and resemblance of the sun drawn
in it; so neither can the soul of man behold God, unless it be Godlike, hath
God formed in it, and be made partaker of the divine nature. ...

To seek our divinity merely in books and writings, is to seek the living among
the dead： we do but in vain seek God many times in these, where his truth too
often is not so much enshrined as entombed no; intra te quaere Deum, seek for
God within thine own soul; he is best discerned voepâ èirafj, as Plotinus
phraseth it, by an intellectual touch of him.
