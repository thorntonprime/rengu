That which is called government, or rather that which we ought to conceive
government to be, is no more than some common center in which all parts of
society unite. This cannot be accomplished by any method so conducive to
the various interests of the community, as by the representative system. It
concentrates the knowledge necessary to the interest of the parts, and
of the whole. It places government in a state of constant maturity. It
is, as has already been observed, never young, never old. It is subject
neither to nonage nor dotage. It is never in the cradle nor on crutches. It
admits not of a separation between knowledge and power, and is superior,
as government always ought to be, to all the accidents of individual man,
and is therefore superior to what is called monarchy.
