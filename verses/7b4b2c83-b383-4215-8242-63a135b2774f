Title: Lost with the Lost, Desiring Lucidity
---
One only ceases to be absurd when, realizing that everything is absurd
when seen in isolation from everything else, meaning and value are sought
only in wholeness. The solitary must, therefore, return to the heart of
life and oneness, losing himself, not in the massive illusion, but simply
in the root reality, plunging through the center of his own nothingness,
and coming out in the All which is the Void and which is, if you like,
the Love of God.

One cannot cease to be absurd by dint of metaphysics, or concentration,
or meditation, or study, or knowledge： only by experiencing the fact
that there is no wall between ourselves and others, in other words,
by accepting the absurdity of our own life in terms of the suffering of
others： no separating “my” pain, suffering, limitation, lostness,
etc., from that of others. As long as a single person is lost, I am
lost. To try to save myself by getting free from the mass of the damned
(Augustine’s massa damnata), and becoming good by myself, is to be
both damned and absurd -- as well as antichrist. Christ descended into
hell to show that He willed to be lost with the lost, in a certain sense
emptied so that they might be filled and saved, in the realization that
now their lostness was not theirs but His. Hence the way one begins to
make sense out oflife is taking upon oneself the lostness of everyone --
and then realizing not that one has done something, or “made sense,”
but that one has simply entered into the stream of realization. The rest
will work out by itsel, f and we do not know what that might mean
