The soul has now no further awareness of the body and will give herself no
foreign name, not man, not living being, nor anything at all; any observation
of such things is beside the mark; the soul has neither time nor taste for
them; This she sought and This she has found and on This she looks and not
upon herself; and who she is that looks she has not leisure to know.

Once There she will barter for This nothing the universe holds -- no not the
heavens entire; than This there is nothing higher, nothing more blessed; above
This there is no passing; all the rest however lofty lies on the downward path;
she knows that This was the object of her quest, that nothing higher is. Here
can be no deceit; where could she come upon truer than the truth? And the
truth she affirms, that she is herself. In this happiness she knows beyond
delusion that she is happy; for this is no affirmation of an excited body
but of a soul become again what she was in the time of her early joy.
