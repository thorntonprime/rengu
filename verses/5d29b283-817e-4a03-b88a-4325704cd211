A devotee who can call on God while living a householder’s life is a
hero indeed. God thinks： ‘He who has renounced the world for My sake
will surely pray to Me. He must serve Me. Is there anything very
remarkable about it? People will cry shame on him if he fails to do
so. But he is blessed indeed who prays to Me in the midst of his
worldly duties.  He is trying to find Me, overcoming a great
obstacle -- pushing away, as it were, a huge block of stone weighing a
ton.  Such a man is a real hero.’
