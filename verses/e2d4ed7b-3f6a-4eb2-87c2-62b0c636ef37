    Title: Does God Exist?
By: Hans Kung
---
How is this God -- who so obviously cannot be proved actually to be found? Must
we from the outset refrain from a rational approach to him, throw ourselves
blindly -- so to speak -- into his arms and then perhaps in this very way fall
into nothingness? Believe? Has belief, then, nothing to do with thinking? Is
belief without thought not unconsidered, unjustifiable belief? Or is belief
in God to be something only for devout fanatics and not for thinking people?
