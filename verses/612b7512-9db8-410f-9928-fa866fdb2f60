Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul： let
them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. ...

Set thou a wicked man over him： and let Satan stand at his right
hand.

When he shall be judged, let him be condemned： and let his prayer
become sin.

Let his days be few： and let another take his office.

Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg： let them seek
their bread also out of their desolate places.

Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers
spoil his labour.

Let there be none to extend mercy upon him： neither let there be any
to favour his fatherless children.

Let his posterity be cut off： and in the generation following let
their name be blotted out.
