St Dionysius says, fullness of joy is perfect consciousness, a balanced
interchange of nature, whereby the soul beholds herself in the mirror of the
Godhead. God is the mirror, unveiled to whom he will and veiled from whom
he will The divine nature in the Persons is a mirror, beyond the reach of
any word. In so far as the soul can project herself beyond words so far she
approaches that mirror. In that mirror the union is simply one of likeness.
