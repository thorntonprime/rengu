To a good man to serve the will of God, it is in the truest and best
sense to serve himself, who knows himself to be nothing without or in
opposition to God; Quô minùs quid sibi arrogat homo, èo evadit
nobilior, clarior, divinior. This is the most divine life that can be,
for a man to act in the world upon eternal designs, and to be so
wholly devoted to the will of God, as to serve it most faithfully and
entirely. This indeed bestows a kind of immortality upon these
flitting and transient acts of ours, which in themselves are but the
offspring of a moment.
