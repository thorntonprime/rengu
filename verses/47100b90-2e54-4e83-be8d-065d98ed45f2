A little Bird ty'd by the Leg with a String, often flutters and strives to
raise itself： but still it is pull’d down to the Earth again： Thus a Soul
fixt in a Self-Principle, may make attempts to Pray and Offer at the Bosom
of God： but still it is snatch'd down by that String of Self, which ties
it to the Ground.
