Title: Consider Beginnings
Commentary: |
  Waley says that this charmingly complex chapter plays with two proverbs.
  “Requite injuries with good deeds” is the first. The word te, here meaning
  goodness or good deeds, is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the
  Way. (“Power is goodness,” he says in chapter 49.) So, having neatly
  annexed the Golden Rule, he goes on to the proverb about “taking things
  too lightly” and plays paradox with it.

Do without doing.
Act without action.
Savor the flavorless.
Treat the small as large,
the few as many.

Meet injury
with the power of goodness.

Study the hard while it’s easy.
Do big things while they’re small.
The hardest jobs in the world start out easy,
the great affairs of the world start small.

So the wise soul,
by never dealing with great things,
gets great things done.

Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,
and taking things too easy makes them hard,
the wise soul,
by treating the easy as hard,
doesn’t find anything hard.
