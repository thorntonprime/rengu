Title: Sweetbriers
---
You said you would come before the sweetbriers’ bloom.
It’s already late spring.
Before spring arrived, I prayed it would come sooner;
but now that it’s here, I’m afraid it has come too early.

The innocent children clamored to tell me
 the sweetbriers are blooming on the hill,
but I pretended not to hear.
The cruel spring wind blew the petals onto my dressing table.
Absently I touched a flower to my lips and asked,
"When did you bloom?”
It didn’t reply -- reflected through my tears, the flower became two,
 then three.
