We should know that books can be understood, and ought to be
explained, in four principal senses. One is called literal, ... the
second is called allegorical, ... the third sense is called moral, ...
the fourth sense is called anagogical And in such demonstration, the
literal sense should always come first, as that whose meaning includes
all the rest, and without which it would be impossible and irrational
to understand the others; and above all would it be impossible with
the allegorical. Because in everything which has an inside and an
outside, it is impossible to get at the inside, if we have not first
got at the outside.
