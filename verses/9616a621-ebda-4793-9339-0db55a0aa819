Wayless and fathomless, ... one can know of it in no other way than through
itself. ...  The abyss of God calls to the abyss; that is, of all those who are
united with the Spirit of God in fruitive love. This inward call is an
inundation of the essential brightness, and this essential brightness,
enfolding us in an abysmal love, causes us to be lost to ourselves, and to flow
forth from ourselves into the wild darkness of the Godhead. And, thus united
without means, and made one with the Spirit of God, we can meet God through
God, and everlastingly possess with Him and in Him our eternal bliss.
