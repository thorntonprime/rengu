Title: The Sick Mind
Commentary: |
  What you know without knowing you know it is the right kind of knowledge.
  Any other kind (conviction, theory, dogmatic belief, opinion) isn’t
  the right kind, and if you don’t know that, you’ll lose the Way. This
  chapter is an example of exactly what Lao Tzu was talking about in the last
  one --  obscure clarity, well-concealed jade.

To know without knowing is best.
Not knowing without knowing it is sick.

To be sick of sickness
is the only cure.

The wise aren’t sick.
They’re sick of sickness,
so they’re well.
