Title: An Old Friend, My Bookend
---
A touching letter came today from Nora Chadwick -- this is one I really
love, though I have never actually met her. She is an old retired Cambridge
professor in her eighties and an authority on Celtic monasticism. She
is busy writing still. All about the old monks. She writes that she
is delighted that I am living the same kind of life as the old guys she
writes aboutï¼š that there actually should be something of the sort in the
world today. This is important to me. For she knows what monasticism is,
and she respects the reality of monastic solitude (not the ersatz and the
institutionalized forms that have survived today). That there should be
men Willing to live in real solitude. Seeing it through her eyes, I am
deeply moved by the meaning of this strange life. Here I am in the middle
of it. I know I have not been truly faithful to it in many ways. I have
evaded it. Yet who can say what its real demands are, other than the one
who must meet them? And who knows what were the failures and problems of
those forgotten people who actually lived as solitaries in the past? How
many of them were lonely, and in love?

All I know is that here I am, and the valley is very quiet, the sun is
going down, there is no human being around, and as darkness falls I could
easily be a completely forgotten person, as if I did not exist for the
world at all. (Though there is one who remembers and whom I remember.) The
day could easfly come when I would be just as invisible as if I never
existed, and still be living here on this hill. And I know that I would
be perfectly content to do so.
