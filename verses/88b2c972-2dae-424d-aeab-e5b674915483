The senses and thoughts are like weeds on the clear water—covering the
surface of the water.

The hand of the intellect sweeps those weeds aside; then the water is
revealed to the intellect. ...

Unless God loose the hand of the intellect, the weeds on our water are
increased by sensual desire. ...

When piety has chained the hands of desire, God looses the hands of the
intellect.
