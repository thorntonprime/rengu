Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
Joy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility,
modesty, willfulness, candor, insolence - music from empty holes,
mushrooms springing up in dampness, day and night replacing each other
before us, and no one knows where they sprout from. Let it be! Let it
be! [It is enough that] morning and evening we have them, and they are
the means by which we live. Without them we would not exist; without us
they would have nothing to take hold of. This comes close to the
matter. But I do not know what makes them the way they are. It would
seem as though they have some True Master, and yet I find no trace of
him. He can act - that is certain. Yet I cannot see his form. He has
identity but no form.
