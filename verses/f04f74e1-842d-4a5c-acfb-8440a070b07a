Praise be to God for His grace in what He has given to me. I have been
granted full and perfect apprehension of the Divine Essence, as I had always
most earnestly desired. That one who has not attained to knowledge of the
Absolute Being is not worthy to be called a man -- he belongs to the type
of those of whom it is said： ‘They are like the beasts of the field and
are even more ignorant.’ But he to whom this supreme happiness has been
granted has become a perfect man and the most exalted of created beings,
for his own existence has become merged in that of the Absolute Being. He
has become a drop in the ocean, a mote in the rays of the sun, a part of the
whole. In this state, he is raised above death and the fear of punishment,
above any regard for Paradise or dread of Hell. Whether woman or man, such
a one is the most perfect of human beings. This is the grace of God which
He gives to whom He wills.
