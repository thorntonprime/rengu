With this sacred pipe you will walk upon the Earth; for the Earth is
your Grandmother and Mother, and She is sacred. Every step that is
taken upon Her should be as a prayer.  The bowl of this pipe is of red
stone; it is the Earth. Carved in the stone and facing the center is
this buffalo calf who represents all the four-leggeds who live upon
your Mother.  The stem of the pipe is of wood, and this represents all
that grows upon the Earth. And these twelve feathers which hang here
where the stem fits into the bowl are from IVanbli Galeshka, the
Spotted Eagle, and they represent the eagle and all the wingeds of the
air. All these peoples, and all the things of the universe, are joined
to you who smoke the pipeâ€”all send their voices to Wakan-Tanka, the
Great Spirit. When you pray with this pipe, you pray for and with
everything.
