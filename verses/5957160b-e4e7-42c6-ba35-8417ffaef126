    Title: The Spiritual Crisis of Man
By: Paul Brunton
---
If one purpose of human life upon this earth is to unfold spiritually
and ifa section of humanity is driven by the pressures of crisis and the
sufferings of war to seek such unfoldment, why should not the World Mind
permit these drastic happenings? The same Nature which gives us mild balmy
summers also gives us arctic cold winters. The same universal laws which
bring the sunlight of noon also bring the midnight of darkness. The same
Power which is bringing infant humanity through its first fumbling steps
towards self-realization, is also permitting it to fall and bruise itself
because only so will humanity ever learn to walk. Who can deny that at least
one section of humanity needs the whip ofsuffering to act as a lesson in
its moral education or as punishment for its blind sins or as stimulant to
awaken it from stagnation into evolutionary movement? Those who will take
the trouble to look deep beneath appearances for realities may even see
in these very same world happenings the vindication of the World Mindâ€™s
care for humanity and a demonstration of Its presence in the world.
