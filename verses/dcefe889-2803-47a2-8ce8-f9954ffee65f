For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God. ...

And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the
cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to
fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an
example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Likewise also these
filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of
dignities. ...

Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain. ...

These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fearï¼š clouds they are without water,
carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the sea, foaming
out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever.
