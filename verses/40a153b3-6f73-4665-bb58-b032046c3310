But the positive side of my mind always assures me that France is not really
herself unless in the front rank; that only vast enterprises are capable
of counter-balancing the ferments of dispersal which are inherent in her

must aim high and hold itself straight, on pain of mortal danger. In short,
to my mind, France cannot be France without greatness.
