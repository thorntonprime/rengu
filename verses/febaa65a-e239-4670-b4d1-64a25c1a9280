Live a whole life without running around,
without righteousness or compassion.

Words branch and leaf; the heart embraces
both lies and betrayals.

Clear just a little path,
you may make of your own life a Great Falsehood.

It's lies that offer a ladder to the clouds ...
and liars that whittle it to splinters.
