Title: Zhaozhouâ€™s Slice of Carelessness
---
A monk asked Zhaozhou, The Far-reaching Way is without
difficulty, only rejecting picking and choosing. For people of these
times, is this a hackneyed phrase run into the ground or not?

Zhao said, I previously had a person ask me, and frankly I gained five
years and a slice of carelessness did not befall.
