Title: Techniques
Commentary: |
  Most of the scholars think this chapter is about meditation, its techniques
  and fulfillments. The language is profoundly mystical, the images are charged,
  rich in implications.

  The last verse turns up in nearly the same words in other chapters; there
  are several such “refrains” throughout the book, identical or similar
  lines repeated once or twice or three times.

Can you keep your soul in its body,
hold fast to the one,
and so learn to be whole?
Can you center your energy,
be soft, tender,
and so learn to be a baby?

Can you keep the deep water still and clear,
so it reflects without blurring?
Can you love people and run things,
and do so by not doing?

Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven,
can you be like a bird with her nestlings?
Piercing bright through the cosmos,
can you know by not knowing?

To give birth, to nourish,
to bear and not to own,
to act and not lay claim,
to lead and not to rule：
this is mysterious power.
