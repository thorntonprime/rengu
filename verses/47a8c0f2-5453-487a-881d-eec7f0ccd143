What is basically required, and what is offered by literature functioning
as myth in a bewildering and secular age, is to imagine the real. Not to
avoid what is, by offering a substitute or a palliative, but to experience
what exists so intensely that through the imagination it realizes its
full potential. Just as Proustian memory not only recaptures the lost
and forgotten moment but makes it more vivid than it had initially been,
so imagination brings reality into its ownï¼š only through rivers running
with wine do we really perceive, as iffor the first time, the running waters
ofthe time we live in. It is an act and an experience which restores that
mythical significance to life without which it would simply flow through
us, unobstructed and unperceived. Myth in literature creates the obstacle
through which we recognize and acknowledge the existence both of ourselves
and the world.
