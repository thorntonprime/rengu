He has illumined appearances with the lights of His traces, and He has
illumined inner selves (as-sarâ’ir) with the lights of His Qualities,
and for that the lights of appearances set, but the lights of hearts and
inner selves do not set. And thus has it been said： ‘The sun of day sets
at night, but the Sun of hearts never disappears.’
