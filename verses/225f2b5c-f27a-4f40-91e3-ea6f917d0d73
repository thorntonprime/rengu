The suffering, disease, and imperfection brought not only upon men, but also
upon plants and animals, by the fall of Adam, found a remedy in that precious
gift of Almighty God, which is called the Elixir, and Tincture, and has power
to purge away the imperfections not only of human, but even of metallic bodies;
which excels all other medicines, as the brightness of the sun shames the moon
and the stars.
