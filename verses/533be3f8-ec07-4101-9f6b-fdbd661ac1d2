Title: The Return to the Father
---
One thing very clear after Mass： the “return to the Father.” The
nonentity and insufficiency of all other concerns. A going clear out of
the midst of all that is transitory and inconclusive. The return to the
Immense, the Primordial, the Unknown, to Him Who Loves, to the Silent,
to the Holy, to the Merciful, to Him Who is All.

The misdirectedness, the folly, the inanity of all that seeks anything
but this great return, the whole meaning and heart of all existence. The
absurdity of movements, of the goals that are not ultimate, the purposes
that are “ends of the line” and, therefore, do not even begin.

To return is not to “go back” in time, but a going forward, a going
beyond. To retrace one’s steps is nothing on top of nothing, vanity of
vanities, a renewal of the same absurdity twice over, in reverse.

To go beyond everything, to leave everything and press forward to the End
and to the Beginning, to the ever new Beginning that is without End. To
obey Him on the way in order to reach Him in Whom I have begun,Who is
the Way and the End -- (the Beginning).
