Visitor： I often desire to live in solitude where I can find all I want with
ease, so that I may devote all my time to meditation only. Is such a desire
good or bad?

Maharshi： Such thoughts will bestow a janma (reincarnation) for their
fulfilment. What does it matter where and how you are placed? The essential
point is that the mind must always remain in its source. There is nothing
external which is not also internal. The mind is all. If the mind is active
even solitude becomes like a market place. There is no use closing your
eyes. Close the mental eye and all will be right.
