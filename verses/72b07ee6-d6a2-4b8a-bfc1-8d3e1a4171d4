Title: My Farewell
---
Some new texture of consciousness has risen
where I camped.

A fire that I sat around and thought of you,
you turned into a place of pilgrimage that God
visits.

Not bowing to anyone but yourself, is where
this world is rightfully heading.

The Beloved is making me the center of His
own being. How can one accept such an office?

Take your greatest moment of pleasure and
multiply that by a millionfold, then you might
barely conceive of what I am talking about.

Has your life been so conservative and restrainted
that you never collapsed onto the floor from
ecstacy?

Who can remain standing in this divine process
of turning into God? All forms collapse into a
golden dust.

Nothing of me may survive to speak. These
poems are my farewell. A silence between us

would be my preference, but then my awkward
kiss, my words, might not be known.
