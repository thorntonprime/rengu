\"He who considers wealth a good thing can never bear to give up his
income; he who considers eminence a good thing can never bear to give
up his fame. He who has a taste for power can never bear to hand over
authority to others. Holding tight to these things, such men shiver
with fear; should they let them go, they would pine in sorrow. They
never stop for a moment of reflection, never cease to gaze with greedy
eyes - they are men punished by Heaven. Resentment and kindness, taking
away and giving, reproof and instruction, life and death - these eight
things are the weapons of the corrector. Only he who complies with
the Great Change and allows no blockage will be able to use them.
Therefore it is said, The corrector must be correct. If the mind cannot
accept this fact, then the doors of Heaven will never open!"
