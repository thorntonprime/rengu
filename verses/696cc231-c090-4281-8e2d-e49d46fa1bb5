\"Fame is a public weapon - don't reach for it too often. Benevolence
and righteousness are the grass huts of the former kings; you may stop
in them for one night but you mustn't tarry there for long. A lengthy
stay would invite many reproaches. The Perfect Man of ancient times
used benevolence as a path to be borrowed, righteousness as a lodge to
take shelter in. He wandered in the free and easy wastes, ate in the
plain and simple fields, and strolled in the garden of no bestowal.
Free and easy, he rested in inaction; plain and simple, it was not hard
for him to live; bestowing nothing, he did not have to hand things out.
The men of old called this the wandering of the Truth-picker.
