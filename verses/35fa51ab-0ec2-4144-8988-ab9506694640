If you think you have ascended to that high place of the heart and
climbed that high and great mountain, if you feel you have seen Christ
transfigured, do not believe too easily whatever you may see in him,
or hear from him unless Moses and Elias are with him. For we know that
every word must be confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses
(Deut. XIX. 15). I suspect every truth which is not confirmed by the
authority of Scripture nor do I accept Christ transfigured unless
Moses and Elias bear him company.
