What, after all, is right and what is wrong? That thought or action which
takes you towards God is right, and that thought or action which takes
you away from God is wrong. You can find out for yourself whether you are
progressing towards God, or going away from Him. There is no thought of right
and wrong after you have reached God; all thoughts cease and all duality is
transcended. Your life then flows spontaneously for the good of all. You live
and act in the divine consciousness. The so-calied sin has no significance
for the saint who has realised God. He becomes totally pure and holy. His
entire life is an offering at the feet of God.
