Title: He Made the Desert Holy
---
The song of my Beloved beside the stream. The birds descanting in their
clerestories. His skies have sanctified my eyes, His woods are clearer than
the Kingâ€™s palace. But the air and I will never tell our secret.

The first Sunday of Lent, as I now know, is a great feast. Christ has
sanctified the desert, and in the desert I discovered it. The woods have
all become young in the discipline of spring, but it is the discipline of
expectancy only. Which one cuts more keenly? The February sunlight or the
air? There are no buds. Buds are not guessed at or even thought of this
early in Lent. But the wilderness shines with promise. The land is first in
simplicity and strength. Everything foretells the coming of the holy spring. I
had never before spoken freely or so intimately with woods, hills, buds,
water, and sky. On this great day, however, they understood their position
and they remained mute in the presence of the Beloved. Only His light was
obvious and eloquent. My brother and sister, the light and the water. The
stump and the stone. The tables of rock. The blue, naked sky. Tractor tracks,
a little waterfall. And Mediterranean solitude. I thought of Italy after my
Beloved had spoken and was gone.
