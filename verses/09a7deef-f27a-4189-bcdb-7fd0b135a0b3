If one loses one's being in the contemplation of the Divine Name, one can merge
oneself in the ocean of heavenly beauty. God and His symbolical names are one
and the same; as soon as the consciousness of the outside world disappears,
the self-revealing power of the Name inevitably finds its objective expression.
