By not exalting the talented you will cause the people to cease from
 rivalry and contention.
By not prizing goods hard to get, you will cause the people to cease from
 robbing and stealing.
By not displaying what is desirable, you will cause the people's hearts to
 remain undisturbed.

Therefore, the Sage's way of governing begins by

Emptying the heart of desires,
Filling the belly with food,
Weakening the ambitions,
Toughening the bones.

In this way he will cause the people to remain without knowledge and
 without desire, and prevent the knowing ones from any ado.
Practice Non-Ado, and everything will be in order.
