Those inward blessings of the spiritual life ... are so many spurs, motives
and incitements to live wholly unto God; yet they may, instead of that, fill
us with self-satisfaction and self-esteem and prompt us to despise others
that want them, as in a poor, mean and reprobate state; who yet may be higher
advanced and stand in a nearer degree of union with God, by humility, faith,
resignation and pure love, in their inward poverty and emptiness than we who
live high upon spiritual satisfactions and can talk of nothing but our feasts
of fat things.  All that I would here say of these inward delights and
enjoyments is only this—they are not holiness, they are not piety, they are
not perfection, but they are God’s gracious allurements and calls to seek
after holiness and spiritual perfection. They are not to be sought for their
own sakes, ... but to be received as cordials that suppose us to be sick,
faint, and languishing, and ought rather to convince us that we are as yet
but babes than that we are really men of God.
