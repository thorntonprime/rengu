Very many people today think in such terms as these： “either God exists,
or He does not; if He exists and is what people say He is, then He will
recognize that we are good and do not deserve punishment.” This means that
they are prepared to believe in His existence provided He conforms to their
own imaginings and recognizes the value they attribute to themselves. This is
to forget, on the one hand, that we cannot know the standards by which the
Absolute judges us, and on the other that the “fire” beyond the tomb is
definitively nothing but our own intellect actualized in opposition to our
own falseness; in other words, it is the immanent truth breaking forth into
the full light of day.
