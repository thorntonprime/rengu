In the ego’s world of illusion, all things are in flux. But continuous
change is constant chaos. When the ego sees itself as the center of so much
swirling activity, it cannot experience cosmic harmony.

For example, what the ego considers to be a devastating hurricane is, as
far as the universe is concerned, a perfectly natural event, a link in the
endless chain of cause and effect. The universe, having no ego, continues
its existence without rendering judgments about hurricanes or ocean
breezes.

When we are empty of ego we, too, can carry on in calm acceptance of life’s
varying events. When we cease making prejudicial distinctions – gentle or
harsh, beautiful or ugly, good or bad – a peaceful stillness will permeate
our mind. If there is no ego, there is no agitation.
