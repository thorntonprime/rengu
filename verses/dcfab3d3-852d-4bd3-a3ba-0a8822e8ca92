Great will be the difficulties when you first try to dominate your
thoughts. You must make war on them and they will do their best to
defend their existence, in asserting their right to remain in the
palace of your mind, which they have occupied from time immemorial：
they will struggle to the end to maintain their right of seniority.
Accordingly, they will assault you with violence. When you are
meditating, all kinds of ugly ideas will come up and redouble in
strength with each attempt to put them down. But the positive always
prevails over the negative： just as darkness cannot resist the light
of the sun or the leopard confront the lion, so will your obscure and
negative thoughts—those invisible intruders, enemies of peace— be
unable to withstand high aspirations： they will die of themselves.
