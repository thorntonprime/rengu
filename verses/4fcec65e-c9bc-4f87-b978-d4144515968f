No perfection can be obtained from imperfect metals, either by
themselves or mixed, nor can that which is itself imperfect bring
other things to perfection. ... Geber clearly shews that the substance
of our Stone cannot exist in imperfect metalsï¼š because things that
are impure in themselves do not abide the fire which might purify
them, while our mercury (on account of its purity) is not in the
slightest degree injured by the fire. Thus we perceive that no one
imperfect metal can contain the substance of our Stone. But neither is
it to be found in a mixture of impure metals -- for by mixing they
become less pure than they were before. Moreover we said above that
the substance we required was one.
