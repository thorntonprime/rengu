Title: I Think We Need a Password
---
I think we need a password, or let's make that a pass-sentence.

That way, in case you ever come to my door in an emergency and God and
I are busy inside,

we could then just shout, Tell us the password! if you really want to
snuggle.

And part of the password will be you knowing it is really ...
a pass-sentence. And here it is in all its glory and truth：

  Love kicks the ass of time and space.

Upon hearing that God and I would look at each other bewildered, but
with delight. We would be glad someone had reached us… with the golden
key on their tongue.

Though just to make sure we heard you right we might say in unison,
Sing it loudly, baby! Cut loose! We need to double check!

And then if you did, a strength and smile might rise inside of you,
and right next to my heart you might be for a moment ... beaming like an
eye that knows.

Don't forget now： LKTAOTAS.

Maybe even tattoo that somewhere so you will remember
