After Carpenter Shih had returned home, the oak tree appeared to him in
a dream and said, "What are you comparing me with? Are you comparing me
with those useful trees? The cherry apple, the pear, the orange, the
citron, the rest of those fructiferous trees and shrubs - as soon as
their fruit is ripe, they are torn apart and subjected to abuse. Their
big limbs are broken off, their little limbs are yanked around. Their
utility makes life miserable for them, and so they don't get to finish
out the years Heaven gave them, but are cut off in mid-journey. They
bring it on themselves - the pulling and tearing of the common mob. And
it's the same way with all other things.
