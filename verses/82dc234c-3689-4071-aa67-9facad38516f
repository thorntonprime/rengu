Long ago, in the time of Yung Ch'eng, Ta T'ing, Po Huang, Chung Yang,
Li Lu, Li Hsu, Hsien Yuan, Ho Hsu, Tsun Lu, Chu Jung, Fu Hsi, and Shen
Nung, the people knotted cords and used them." They relished their
food, admired their clothing, enjoyed their customs, and were content
with their houses. Though neighboring states were within sight of each
other, and could hear the cries of each other's dogs and chickens, the
people grew old and died without ever traveling beyond their own
borders. At a time such as this, there was nothing but the most perfect
order.
