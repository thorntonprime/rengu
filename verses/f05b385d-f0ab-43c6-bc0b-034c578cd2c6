Whether or not the results of meditation are obtained is of no importance. The
essential is to arrive at stability; it is the most precious thing that one
can gain. In any case one must trust with confidence in the Divinity and
await His grace without impatience. The same rule applies equally to japa;
japa pronounced even once is a benefit, whether one is aware of it or not.
