Supply does not come through prayer. It comes as a result of an attitude of
faith, a condition of mind and heart, in which the Invisible is depended
upon solely for all things necessary, instead of upon the visible and
earthly. Prayer in the form of begging and beseeching God to kindly answer
our requests is not capable of producing supply in itself.
