If somebody asks what is meant when it is said that the kneading of the elixir
is done by ‘assembling’ together all the five roots or senses of the body,
it must be answered that there is the law of the five elements which prevents
the increasing of desire. The eye, for instance, must not look at random,
the ear must not listen at random, the tongue must not talk at random, the
body must not touch at random, nor must the mind think at random. When these
important laws are obeyed, then the spirit of this complex essential nature
will be supplied, as it were, before one’s very eyes. This essential nature
is what Mencius called the ‘Expansive Spirit’. From this it follows that by
concentrating these in the space under the navel and preserving it, year after
year, so that it becomes invincibly strong, then before you realize it, the
elixir-oven will raise the elixir. ... With this attainment comes the power to
stir up the great ocean into cream, to change the hard soil into harder gold,
and so it is said that ‘One grain of the elixir changes iron into gold’.
