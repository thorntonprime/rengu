Title: As a Wick Does
---
There is nourishment like bread
that feeds one part of your life,
nourishment like light for another.

There are many rules about restraint
with the former, but only one rule
for the latter. Never be satisfied.

Eat and drink the soul substance
as a wick does with the oil it soaks in.
Give light to the company.
