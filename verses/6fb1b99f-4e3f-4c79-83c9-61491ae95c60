JUST. Do what you will, Major, I remain in your service; I must remain.

MAJOR VON TELLHEIM. With your obstinacy, your insolence, your savage
boisterous temper toward all who you think have no business to speak to you,
your malicious pranks, your love of revenge --

JUST. Make me as bad as you will, I shall not think worse of myself than
my dog. Last winter I was walking one evening at dusk along the river,
when I heard something whine. I stooped down, and reached in the direction
whence the sound came, and when I thought I was saving a child, I pulled a
dog out of the water. That is well, thought I. The dog followed me; but I
am not fond of dogs, so I drove him away -- in vain. I whipped him away --
in vain. I shut him out of my room at night; he lay before the door. If he
came too near me, I kicked him; he yelped, looked up at me, and wagged his
tail. I have never yet given him a bit of bread with my own hand; and yet
I am the only person whom he will obey, or who dares touch him. He jumps
about me, and shows off his tricks to me, without my asking for them. He
is an ugly dog, but he is a good animal. If he carries it on much longer,
I shall at last give over hating him.
