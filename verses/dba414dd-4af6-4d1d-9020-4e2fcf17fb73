No creature can do more than in her lies. The soul makes headway solely
by the light that God has given her, that being her own, presented her
by God as a bridal gift. God comes in love with intent that the soul
may arise, that in love she may energise above herself. ... Soul does
not ply the work of grace (since that is not her nature) till she is
gotten yonder, where God is plying himself, where the work is as noble
as the worker, his own nature, to wit.
