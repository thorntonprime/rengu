    Title: I Don't Bow to Buddhas

Format: verse
Title: Motto

---
When I meet a monk,
I bow politely.
When I see a Buddha,
I don't.

If I bow to a Buddha,
the Buddha won't know.
But I honor a monkï¼š
he's here now, apparently,
or, at least, he seems to be.

Night Thought
Midnight, sudden jerk
awake.
Wordless, Heart still, sighs.

Tonight the frost's first fall,
that's all, and I
forgot to cover the houseplants.
