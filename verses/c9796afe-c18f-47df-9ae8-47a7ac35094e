Description: From the Ghost Dancers at Wounded Knee

Mother Nature is all-powerful, and eternity is on her side. What are the
inventions of man. the lofty cities which he raises on the borders of the
desert, the terrible weapons that he uses to realize and defend his conquests?
Nothing, but a little heaped-up dust which the great natural forces always tend
to restore to its primevalform. Forsake the citadel for a few years, abandon
the canon or machine gun for a few months in the prairie, and soon grass and
brambles will have overgrown the stones, and rust corroded the hard steel. In
how many former times have vast solitudes been peopled by powerful cities! Of
them today remain no more than the ruins, and the ruins themselves finally
disappear back into the eternally virgin earth. Of what importance are the men
who pass? The Spirit has only to blow on them and they will be no more! Then
the sons of the Earth will repossess the Earth. And the past time will begin
over again as the new time!
