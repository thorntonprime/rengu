How does the sea become the king of all streams?
Because it lies lower than they!
Hence it is the king of all streams.

Therefore, the Sage reigns over the people by humbling himself in speech;
And leads the people by putting himself behind.

Thus it is that when a Sage stands above the people, they do not feel the
 heaviness of his weight;
And when he stands in front of the people, they do not feel hurt.
Therefore all the world is glad to push him forward without getting tired
 of him.

Just because he strives with nobody,
Nobody can ever strive with him.
