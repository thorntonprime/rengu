Title: The Rain Song
---
It is the springtime of my loving
the second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
so little warmth I've felt before.
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low.

It is the summer of my smiles
flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes.
It is to you I give this tune.
Ain't so hard to recognize
These things are clear to all
from time to time.

Talk Talk
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go.
I cursed the gloom that set upon us...
But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
and like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I seek the torch we all must hold.
This is the mystery of the quotient
Upon us all a little rain must fall
It's just a little rain
