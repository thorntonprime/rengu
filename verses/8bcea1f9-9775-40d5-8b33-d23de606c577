Words of praise, gratitude, or thanksgiving expand, set free, and in
every way radiate energy. ... You can praise a weak body into strength; a
fearful heart into peace and trust; shattered nerves into poise and power;
a failing business into prosperity and success; want and insufficiency
into supply and support.
