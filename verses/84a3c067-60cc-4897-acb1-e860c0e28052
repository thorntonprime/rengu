Title: The Face
---
So the frowning teacher came and left.
He is very consistent with that vinegar face.

But maybe he shows that to us and smiles with others.
Such a beautiful teacher, but so sour.
He is a pure standard for tartness.

Consider how your face is a source of light.
If you enter a grieving room
with the Friend in your eyes,
light will bloom there
according to the laws of sweet and sour.

Locked in a cell, you grow bitter, but out walking
in morning sunlight with friends,
how does that taste?

There are exceptions. Joseph caught the rose
fragrance down in his abandoned wellhole.

In this quietness now
I feel someone seated on my right
like a kindness that will never leave.
