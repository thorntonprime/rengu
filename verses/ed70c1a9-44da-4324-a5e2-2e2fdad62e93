Title: Mending The Inborn Nature

The time came, however, when Virtue began to dwindle and decline, and
then Sui Jen and Fu Hsi stepped forward to take charge of the world. As
a result there was compliance, but no longer any unity. Virtue
continued to dwindle and decline, and then Shen Nung and the Yellow
Emperor stepped forward to take charge of the world. As a result, there
was security, but no longer any compliance. Virtue continued to dwindle
and decline, and then Yao and Shun stepped forward to take charge of
the world. They set about in various fashions to order and transform
the world, and in doing so defiled purity and shattered simplicity. The
Way was pulled apart for the sake of goodness; Virtue was imperiled for
the sake of conduct. After this, inborn nature was abandoned and minds
were set free to roam, mind joining with mind in understanding; there
was knowledge, but it could not bring stability to the world. After
this, "culture" was added on, and "breadth" was piled on top. "Culture"
destroyed the substantial, "breadth" drowned the mind, and after this
the people began to be confused and disordered. They had no way to
revert to the true form of their inborn nature or to return once more
to the Beginning.
