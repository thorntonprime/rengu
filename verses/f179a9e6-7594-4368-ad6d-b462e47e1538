Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
By the time the kings of the Three Dynasties appeared, the world was in
great consternation indeed. On the lowest level there were men like the
tyrant Chieh and Robber Chih, on the highest, men like Tseng and Shih,
and the Confucianists and Mo-ists rose up all around. Then joy and
anger eyed each other with suspicion, stupidity and wisdom duped each
other, good and bad called one another names, falsehood and truth
slandered one another, and the world sank into a decline. There was no
more unity to the Great Virtue, and the inborn nature and fate
shattered and fell apart. The world coveted knowledge and the hundred
clans were thrown into turmoil. Then there were axes and saws to shape
things, ink and plumb lines to trim them, mallets and gouges to poke
holes in them, and the world, muddled and deranged, was in great
confusion. The crime lay in this meddling with men's minds. So it was
that worthy men crouched in hiding below the great mountains and
yawning cliffs, and the lords of ten thousand chariots fretted and
trembled above in their ancestral halls.
