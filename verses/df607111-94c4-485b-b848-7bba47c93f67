An thou returnest it is not because of any truth; it is either the
senses, the world or the devil. And persisting in this turning back,
thou dost inevitably lapse into sin and art liable to backslide so far
as to have the eternal fall. Wherefore there is no turning back, only
a pressing forward and following up this possibility to its
fulfilment. It never rests until fulfilled with all being. As matter
never rests until fulfilled with every possible form, so intellect
never rests till it is filled to the full of its capacity.
