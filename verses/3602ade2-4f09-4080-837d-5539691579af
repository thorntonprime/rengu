“Now, if anyone would develop these four establishings of mindfulness
in this way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected for him：
either gnosis [full awakening] right here and now, or-if there be any
remnant of clinging-sustenance-non-return. [There are four levels of
awakening. Non-return-in which you are not destined to be born again in
the human world, and will reach unbinding in one of the higher heavens-is
the third of the four.]

“Let alone seven years. If anyone would develop these four establishings
of mindfulness in this way for six years ... five ... four ...
three ... two years ... one year ... seven months ... six months ...
five ... four ... three ... two months ... one month ... half a month, one of
two fruits can be expected for him： either gnosis right here and now,
or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return.

“Let alone half a month. If anyone would develop these four establishings
of mindfulness in this way for seven days, one of two fruits can be
expected for him： either gnosis right here and now, or-if there be any
remnant of clinging-sustenance-non-return.

“‘This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the
overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and
distress, for the attainment of the right method, and for the realization
of unbinding-in other words, the four establishings of mindfulness.’
Thus was it said, and in reference to this was it said.”

That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the
Blessed One’s words.
