Title: Having Nothing
---
Whatever comes, comes from a need,
a sore distress, a hurting want.

Mary's pain made the baby Jesus.
Her womb opened its lips
and spoke the Word.

Every part of you has a secret language.
Your hands and your feet say what you have done.

Every need brings in what's needed.
Pain bears its cure like a child.

Having nothing produces provisions.
Ask a difficult question,
and the marvelous answer appears.

Build a ship, and there will be water
to float it. The tender-throated infant cries,
 and milk drips from the mother's breast.
Be thirsty for the ultimate water.
Then be ready for what will come
pouring from the spring.
