The Master Shen-tsu asked Shen-hui： ‘You say that our Original Nature
has the characteristics of the Absolute. In that case it has no colour,
blue, yellow or the like, that the eye can see. How then can one perceive
one’s Original Nature?’ Shen-hui answered. ‘Our Original Nature is
void and still. If we have not experienced Enlightenment, erroneous ideas
arise. But if we awaken to the erroneous nature of these ideas, both the
Awakening and the wrong idea simultaneously vanish. That is what I mean
by “perceiving one’s Original Nature”.’ Shen-tsu again asked：
‘Despite the light that comes from the Awakening, one is still on the
plane of Birth and Destruction. Tell me by what method one can get clear
of Birth and Destruction?’ Shen-hui answered, ‘It is only because you
put into play the ideas of Birth and Destruction that Birth and Destruction
arise. Rid yourself of these ideas, and there will be no substance to which
you can even distantly apply these names. When the light that comes from
the Awakening is quenched, we pass automatically into Non-being, and there
is no question of Birth or Destruction.’
