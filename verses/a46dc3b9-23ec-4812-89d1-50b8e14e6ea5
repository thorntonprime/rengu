If the gentleman finds he has no other choice than to direct and look
after the world, then the best course for him is inaction. As long as
there is inaction, he may rest in the true form of his nature and fate.
If he values his own body more than the management of the world, then
he can be entrusted with the world. If he is more careful of his own
body than of the management of the world, then the world can be handed
over to him. If the gentleman can in truth keep from rending apart his
five vital organs, from tearing out his eyesight and hearing, then he
will command corpse-like stillness and dragon vision, the silence of
deep pools and the voice of thunder. His spirit will move in the train
of Heaven, gentle and easy in inaction, and the ten thousand things
will be dust on the wind. "What leisure have I now for governing the
world?" he will say.
