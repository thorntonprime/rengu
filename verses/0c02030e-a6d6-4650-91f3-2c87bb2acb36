O moon clad in white and vehemently shining abroad whiteness, let us learn what
is the lunar radiance that we may not miss what is doubtful. For the same is
the whitening snow, the brilliant eye of whiteness, the bridal proc√®ssion-robe
of the management of the process, the stainless chiton, the mind-constructed
beauty of fair form, the whitest composition of the perfection, the coagulated
milk of fulfilment, the Moon-froth of the sea of dawn, the magnesia of Lydia,
the Italian stibnite, the pyrites of Achaea, that of Albania, the many-named
matter of the good work, that which lulls the All to sleep, that which bears
the One which is the All, that which fulfils the wondrous work.
