Title: Zhimenâ€™s Essence and Function
---
The single phrase before a sound is not transmitted by
1,000 sages. The single thread before the face endures without an
interval. All naked and clean, all washed and red, the coiffure on the
head loosened, and the ears erect on the new moon day. Just say, how
do you make it alive? A test is raised for examination

A monk asked Zhimen, So what is the essence of prajna?

Men said, The oyster holds in its mouth the bright
moon.

The monk said, So what is the function of prajna?

Men said, The rabbits offspring are held in the womb.

Xuedou's ode says

One piece of congealed emptiness cuts off names and feelings.

Humans and Devas in accord with this see the being of
emptiness.

The deepest meanings of the oysters holding in its mouth and the dark
rabbit

Have been given to the family of Zen to make war.
