Title: Within This Earthen Vessel
---
Within this earthen vessel are bowers and groves, and within it is the
 Creator：
  Within this vessel are the seven oceans and the unnumbered stars.
  The touchstone and the jewel-appraiser are within;
  And within this vessel the Eternal soundeth, and the spring wells up.
  Kabir says： “Listen to me, my Friend! My beloved Lord is within.”
