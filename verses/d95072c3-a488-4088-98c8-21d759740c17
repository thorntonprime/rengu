For fifteen days I struggled to prove that no [mathematical] functions
analogous to those I have since called Fuchsian functions could exist;
1 was then very ignorant. Every day I sat down at my work table where I
spent an hour or two; I tried a great number of combinations and arrived
at no result. One evening, contrary to my custom, I took black coffee; I
could not go to sleep; ideas swarmed up in clouds; I sensed them clashing
until, to put it so, a pair would hook together to form a stable combination.
By morning I had established the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions,
those derived from the hyper-geometric series. I had only to write up the
results, which took me a few hours.
