Title: They Thought I Was a Marriage Counselor
---
They thought I was a marriage counselor, two goats who lived close by.
I had noticed how at times they would squabble and buck heads, but what
 couple doesn't?
When they did one day come to me for advice I just openly confessed --
 It had been
quite a while since I had walked around on all fours and eaten mostly leaves
 and grass, and flowers, and paper sometimes.
That is, I wasn't sure how well I could fully connect and understand. Still,
 they wanted my help, so we started to see each other once a week.
They are doing better now. And by the way, I have an opening next Friday,
 and charge
hardly a thing. You could barter. Maybe bring an old newspaper, I could hold
 and turn into a blaze.
