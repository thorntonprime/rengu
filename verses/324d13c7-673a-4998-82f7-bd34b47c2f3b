Banish learning, discard knowledge： People will gain a hundredfold.
Banish benevolence, discard righteousness： People will return to duty and
 compassion.
Banish skill, discard profit： There will be no more thieves.
These three statements are not enough. One more step is necessary.
Look at plain silk; hold uncarved wood. The self dwindles; desires fade.
