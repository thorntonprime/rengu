Title: Who Is Living Next Door?
---
Who is really living next door to you? To what extent do you know the
answer,

and therefore for a minute now and then ... are grateful for their
presence?

You have heard about God being indivisible; is that just a rumor?

Is there a difference between God and existence?

Still, most live as if there areâ€¦ many in town, because slowly we
learn.

Some ingredient to solving this vital equation may be missing.

It could be the physical touch of someone who knows the Truth.

Someone who knows the Truth and lives it, the way my Master did,

his touch could bring the fulfillment of prayers.
