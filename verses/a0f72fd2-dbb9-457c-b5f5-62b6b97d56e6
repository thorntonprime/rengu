\"The government of the sage?" said Chun Mang. "Assign offices so that
no abilities are overlooked, promote men so that no talents are
neglected. Always know the true facts and let men do what they are best
at.. When actions and words proceed properly and the world is
transformed, then at a wave of the hand or a tilt of the chin all the
people of the four directions will come flocking to you. This is called
the government of the sage."
