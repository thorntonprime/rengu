All things and all ages derive their existence from the Pre-Existent. All
Eternity and Time are from Him, and He who is Pre-Existent is the Beginning and
the cause of all Eternity and Time and of anything that hath any kind of being.
All things participate in Him nor doth He depart from anything that exists; He
is before all things, and all things have their maintenance in Him; and, in
short, if anything exists under any form whatever, â€™tis in the Pre-Existent
that it exists and is perceived and preserves its being
