That true inward righteousness, which judgeth not according to custom, but out
of the most rightful law of God Almighty, whereby the ways of places and times
were disposed, according to those times and places; itself meantime being the
same always, and every where, not one thing in one place, and another in
another; according to which Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and
David, were righteous, and all those commended by the mouth of God; but were
judged unrighteous by silly men, judging out o f man’s judgment, and measuring
by their own petty habits, the moral habits of the whole human race.
