\"Calculate what man knows and it cannot compare to what he does not
know. Calculate the time he is alive and it cannot compare to the time
before he was born. Yet man takes something so small and tries to
exhaust the dimensions of something so large! Hence he is muddled and
confused and can never get anywhere. Looking at it this way, how do we
know that the tip of a hair can be singled out as the measure of the
smallest thing possible? Or how do we know that heaven and earth can
fully encompass the dimensions of the largest thing possible?"
