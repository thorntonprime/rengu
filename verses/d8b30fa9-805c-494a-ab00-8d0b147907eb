Commentary: |
  The three sourncs are "Essence of Veda, a, u, m=Om (aum); - note in text,
  "OM is the essence of the Vedas' (Swami Sivananda： La Pratique de la
  Méditation, p. 203).

As an earth-clod falling into a great lake is quickly lost, so all evil acts
sink (out of sight) in the threefold Veda.

The texts (Rg-Veda). and the other sacrificial formulas (Yajur-Veda), and
the songs of various sorts (Sâma-Veda) -- this must be known as the threefold
Veda; who knows this Veda, he is Veda-wise.

That primordial brahma, consisting of three sounds, in which the triple
(Veda is) contained, (is) another three-fold Veda (which is) to be kept
secret; who knows it, he is Veda-wise.
