From the nature of despotic power it follows that the single person,
invested with this power, delegates the execution of it also to a single
person. A man whose five senses continually inform him that he himself is
everything and that his subjects are nothing, is naturally lazy, voluptuous,
and ignorant. In consequence of this, he neglects the management of public
affairs. But were he to commit the administration to many, there would be
continual disputes among them; each would form intrigues to be his first
slave; and he would be obliged to take the reins into his own hands. It is,
therefore, more natural for him to resign it to a vizier, and to invest him
with the same power as himself. The creation of a vizier is a fundamental
law of this government.
