HOST. You, Sir, are demeaning yourself by coming here. I pray that your
honour will return home, where I shall hasten to present myself before you.

GUEST. I cannot bring disgrace upon you by obeying this injunction. Be
good enough to end by granting me this interview.

HOST. I do not dare to set an example as to how a reception of this kind
should be conducted, and I must therefore persist in asking your honour
to return to your own house where I shall call upon you without delay.

GUEST. It is I who do not dare to make a precedent. I therefore must
persist in asking you to grant me an interview.

HOST. As for me, as I have failed to obtain your permission to refuse
this honour, I shall press my objection no further. But I hear that your
honour is offering me a present, and this at least I must decline.

GUEST. Without a present, I dare not venture into your presence.

HOST. I am not sufficiently expert in such ceremonies and I must persist
in declining.

GUEST. Without the support and confidence given me by my gift, I have
not the courage to pay this visit. I must persist in my request.

HOST. I am also decided in declining. Yet, as I cannot secure your consent
that I should visit you in your house, how dare I not now respectfully obey?
