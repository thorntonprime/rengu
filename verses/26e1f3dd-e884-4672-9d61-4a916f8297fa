The world is a dwelling surrounded by scourges, and heaped with perfidy. Its
state endures not, and all who come to it perish.

The world is a dwelling degrading to its owner, where the lawful is mixed
with the unlawful, good with evil, sweet with bitter.

Look upon the world with the eye of the cloistered ascetic; not as one loving
it blindly.
