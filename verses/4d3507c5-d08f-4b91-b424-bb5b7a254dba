And therefore it is written, that short prayer pierceth heaven.

And why pierceth it heaven, this little short prayer of one little
syllable? Surely because it is prayed with a full spirit, in the height and
in the depth, in the length and in the breadth of his spirit that prayeth
it. In the height it is, for it is with all the might of the spirit. In
the depth it is, for in this little syllable be contained all the wits of
the spirit. In the length it is, for might it ever feel as it feeleth, ever
would it cry as it cryeth. In the breadth it is, for it willeth the same to
all other that it willeth to itself.
