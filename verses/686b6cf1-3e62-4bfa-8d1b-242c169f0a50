God is the hardest taskmaster I have known on this earth, and He tries
you through and through. And when you find that your faith is failing or
your body is failing you, and you are sinking, He comes to your assistance
somehow or other and proves to you that you must not lose your faith and
that He is always at your beck and call, but on His terms, not on your
terms. So I have found. I cannot really recall a single instance when,
at the eleventh hour, He has forsaken me.
