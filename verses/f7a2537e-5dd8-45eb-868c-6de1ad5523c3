Commentary: Citing a holy Father

Conformity to the Divine Will contains, in a high degree, true
mortification, perfect subjection, complete self-abnegation, the
imitation of Jesus Christ, union with God, and. in general, all
virtues, which are virtues only for this reasonï¼š because they are
according to the Will of God. This conformity is the beginning and the
guide of all perfection.
