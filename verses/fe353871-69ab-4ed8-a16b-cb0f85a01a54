Once in mid-reach I inquired of my hand,

“Friend, what moves you in that direction? What hope do you expect to
fulfill?”

And an answer came to mind for my hand has never really talked.

A voice I heard within said, “It is freedom from the shackle that is
the root of all desire.”

It is freedom from the shackle that is the root of all desire.
