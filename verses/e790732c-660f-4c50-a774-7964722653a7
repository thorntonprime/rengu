He that will not seek thereby a new man born in God, and apply himself
diligently thereto, let him not meddle with my writings.

I have not written anything for such a seeker, and also he shall not be able to
apprehend our meaning fundamentally, though he strives never so much about it,
unless he enters into the resignation in Christ; there he may apprehend the
spirit of the universal, otherwise all is to no purpose; and we faithfully warn
the curious critic not to amuse himself, for he will not effect anything in
this way, unless he himself enters thereinto, and then it will be shewn him
without much seeking; for the way is child-like.
