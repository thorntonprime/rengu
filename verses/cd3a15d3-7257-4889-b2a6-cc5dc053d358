God is in the Scriptures said to be a consuming fire. But to whom? To
the fallen angels and lost souls. But why and how is He so to them? It
is because those creatures have lost all that they had from God but
fire; and therefore God can only be found and manifested in them as a
consuming fire. Now, is it not justly said that God, who is nothing
but infinite love, is yet in such creatures only a consuming fire, and
that though God be nothing but love, yet they are under the wrath and
vengeance of God, because they have only that fire in them which is
broken off from the light and love of God, and so can know or feel
nothing of God but His fire in them? ... Hell is nothing but the fire
of heaven separated from its first light and majesty.
