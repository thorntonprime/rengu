The mind of the yogi is always fixed on God. always absorbed in the
Self. You can recognize such a man by merely looking at him. His eyes
are wide open, with an aimless look, like the eyes of the mother bird
hatching her eggs. Her entire mind is fixed on the eggs, and there is
a vacant look in her eyes.
