Self-annihilation consists in this, that through the overpowering influence of
the Very Being upon the inner man there remains no consciousness of aught
beside Him.  Annihilation of annihilation consists in this, that there remains
no consciousness even of that unconsciousness. It is evident that annihilation
of annihilation is involved in (the very notion of) annihilation. For if he who
has attained annihilation should retain the least consciousness of his
annihilation, he would not be in the state of annihilation, because the quality
of annihilation and the person possessing such quality are both things distinct
from the Very Being, the ‘Truth’ most glorious. Therefore, to be conscious of
annihilation is incompatible with annihilation.
