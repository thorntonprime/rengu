Q： From all you have just said, Mind is the Buddha; but it is not clear as to
what sort of mind is meant by this ‘Mind which is the Buddha’.

A： How many minds have you got?

Q： But is the Buddha the ordinary mind or the Enlightened mind?

A： Where on earth do you keep your ‘ordinary mind’ and your ‘Enlightened
mind’?
