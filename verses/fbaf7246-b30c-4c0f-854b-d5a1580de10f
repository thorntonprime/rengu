In beauty may we walk：
beauty before us
  behind us
  above us
  below us
With beauty all around us may we walk.

May we walk in this circle of beauty
and know that it is one：
the trail of tears and laughter;
the trail of war and peace.

May we always walk in the energy of light,
the light of the Milky Way.

May we walk in this moment's beauty.
May we continue to dance.

It is finished in beauty.
It is finished in beauty.
It is finished in beauty.
