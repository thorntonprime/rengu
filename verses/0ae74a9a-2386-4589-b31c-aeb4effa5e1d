The late Jagadguru has repeatedly prayed to God to vouchsafe to the people of
the land the recollection of the sacred truths. ... His anxiety is that faith
in the Sâstras should be restored once again in the land so that the people
may abandon the new ways of life, conduct and dress which they have adopted
quite in violation of the rules of their respective castes and families.

It is well known that people everywhere are now suffering. It can be
confidently asserted that this suffering dates from their giving up the
courses of conduct observed by their ancestors. When the practice of Dharma
began to decline, suffering began.
