The Son knows all things essentially in the essence of the Father who,
essentially, has the potentiality of all things that shall happen and shall
not happen. He has in his Person the universal image, so that he knows
all things in common with the Father and wields joint power over what has
happened, what is happening and what is still to happen, as well as over
what God could do an he would that never happens.
