Lao Tan said, "Be careful - don't meddle with men's minds! Men's minds
can be forced down or boosted up, but this downing and upping imprisons
and brings death to the mind. Gentle and shy, the mind can bend the
hard and strong; it can chisel and cut away, carve and polish. Its heat
is that of burning fire, its coldness that of solid ice, its swiftness
such that, in the time it takes to lift and lower the head, it has
twice swept over the four seas and beyond. At rest, it is deep-fathomed
and still; in movement, it is far-flung as the heavens, racing and
galloping out of reach of all bonds. This indeed is the mind of man!"
