  \'Now to revolve in a tholiform manner is to revolve in a horizontal plane,
  like the Oi.ios, or “dome”, of an astronomical observatory. Anaxagoras
  himself defined the motion more fully when he said that it was a motion,
  not vno, underneath, but nepl, around the earth' (Warren, op. cit.. p. 192).
  This is the motion of the sky as seen from the North Pole, where the
  Primordial Tradition is said to have been situated.
