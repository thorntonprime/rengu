Yield and be preserved.
Bend and be restraightened.
Empty and be filled.
Exhaust and be renewed.
Have little and be enriched.
Have much and be overwhelmed.

The sage holds fast to integrity
and shows the Way for all to see.
Not displaying himself, he shines as an example.
Not promoting himself, he is known by all.
Not crediting himself, he is recognized,
Not lauding himself, he is remembered.

He does not compete,
hence no one can get the better of him.
Just soï¼š
Who yields is preserved.
