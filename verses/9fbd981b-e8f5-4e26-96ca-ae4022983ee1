I am no socialist and I do not want to dispossess those who have got
possessionsï¼š but I do say that personally those of us who want to see
light out of darkness have to follow this rule. I do not want to dispossess
anybody. I should then be departing from the rule of Ahimsa. If somebody
else possesses more than I do, let him. But so far as my own life has to
be regulated, I dare not possess anything which I do not want.
