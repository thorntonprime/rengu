White whisk, sandalwood, the handle,
with a natural fragrance that lasts sun's rise to fall.
The whisk itself is soft as rolling mist,
turning, when it's brandished, like a rank of clouds.
Its lightness fits it to the rites of summer,
raised high, then flicking in the dust.
Day after day arid season into season,
inside the master's cell ...
It has pointed many a lost man well upon his way.
