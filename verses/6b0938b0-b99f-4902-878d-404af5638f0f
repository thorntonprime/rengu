Now there are two kinds of sulphur, the living and the combustible.
Quick sulphur is the active principle of metals, and, when purged
from all foreign matter, is the Matter of our Stone. But the common
combustible variety is not the Matter of metals or of our Stone;
rather, it is injurious to them. Common, combustible sulphur -- so we
are told by Avicenna and Richard the Englishman -- has nothing to do
with our art. However carefully prepared, it still disintegrates and
destroys metals, because it has no affinity with them. ... How then
can it impart life to other things? For it has two principles of
decay -- its inflammability and its earthy impurity. The sulphur of
the Sages, on the other hand, is living fire; it is quick, and
quickens and matures lifeless substances. Common sulphur, then, cannot
be the substance of the Stone.
