Title: Amergin's Song
---
I am the stag with seven tines,
a flood widening across a plain.
I am wind in a trough of ocean,
the sun's tear, a globe of dew-wet
on an alder branch. I am a hawk
above the cliff, streaming and still,
a thorn beneath the thumbnail,
fire that makes a human head
of smoke above itself.

I am the oak and the lightning
that blackens one side, salmon swimming
and the taste of it cooked
on a hawthorne shaft, a hill of vineyards
and hazelnut trees where poets walk.

I am the charging wild boar, the ivy,
a breaker thrumming down its falling edge.
I am the infant under the unhewn dolmen stone,
flower in the midst of other flowers,
spearpoint. I am the bonfire on the hill,
the hive-queen and the shield,
the screech owl. I am the burning raft
with its body set adrift on nightwater.
