Title: Silence
---
Weave a silence onto my lips.
Weave a silence into my mind.
Weave a silence within my heart.
Close my ears to distractions.
Close my eyes to attractions.
Close my heart to temptations.

Calm me, as you have calmed the storm.
Still me, keep me from harm.
Let all tumult within me cease.
Enfold me in your peace.
