Tze Ch'i of Nan-poh was travelling on the Shang mountain when he saw a
large tree which astonished him very much. A thousand chariot teams
could have found shelter under its shade.

\‘What tree is this?' cried Tze Ch'i. ‘Surely it must have unusually
fine timber." Then looking up. he saw that its branches were too
crooked for rafters： while as to the trunk he saw that its irregular
grain made it valueless for coffins. He tasted a leaf, but it took the
skin off his lips： and its odour was so strong that it would make a
man as it were drunk for three days together.

\'Ah!' said Tze Ch'i. ‘This tree is good for nothing, and that is how
it has attained this size. A wise man might well follow its example.'
