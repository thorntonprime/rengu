    Title: Brihad-Âranyaka Upanishad
    Locus: III vii 23
Tags:
  - Discernment-Truth=Knowledge=The Knower and the Known
  - Discernment-Truth=Reality=The Nature of Reality
Commentary: These formulae have their Islamic equivalent in the Shahâdah：
  Là ilâha illâ 'Lláh, 'There is no divinity if not the Divinity' --  a
  doctrinal synthesis which can be extended to all Archetypes. Thus： there
  is no act if not the Act, there is no beauty if not the Beauty, there is no
  wisdom if not the Wisdom, etc.

He is the unseen Seer, the unheard Hearer, the unthought Thinker, the
uncomprehended Comprehensor. Other than He there is no seer. Other than He
there is no hearer. Other than He there is no thinker. Other than He there is
no comprehensor. He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.
