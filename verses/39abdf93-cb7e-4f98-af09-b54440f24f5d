Title: His Parting Face
---
Flowers are sweetest when they fall,
the sun most fine when it sets.
Melodies are best when choked,
his face most enticing when we part.

After parting, the face reflected in my fantasy is so bewitching
  I can’t look at it without a cushion of tears.
I’ll chisel that enticing face in my mind’s eye：
a face too unfeeling to move me, it cannot stir my heart to love.
To lose sight of that charming face would pain me more than tears
 of sorrow.
