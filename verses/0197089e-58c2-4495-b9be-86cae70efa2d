Ordinary love based on the physical affinity is a source of misery both to
the lover and the loved. But Divine Love based on the feeling of
spiritual oneness is sublime. It is a source of pure bliss. Here you love
another not because he is a relation of yours, but because you and he are one
in Spirit.
