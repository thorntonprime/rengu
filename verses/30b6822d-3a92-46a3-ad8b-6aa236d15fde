Worldly folk who have heaped up evil karma during their lifetime, and
who anticipate reaping, as the result, the pangs of birth, old age,
illness, and death, in this world, vainly seek to evade or ameliorate
the intensity and anguish thereof by means of propitiatory ceremonies
and medical treatment. Neither through the power or authority of
kings, nor the valour of the hero, nor the charming form of the belle,
nor the wealth of the rich, nor the fleetness of the coward, nor the
oratory of an able pleader, can one ward off, or retard for a moment,
the Decree of Time. There are no means or methods, be they peaceful,
noble, fascinating, or stern, which can buy off or stop the execution
of this unalterable decree. If any there be who are truly fearful of
those pangs, and sincerely seek to prevent their recurrence, and are
really eager to attain a state of eternal bliss. I possess the secret
rite for the attainment thereof.
