Oh God, the Protector, the basis of all life, Who is self-existent, Who is free
from all pains and Whose contact frees the soul from all troubles, Who pervades
the Universe and sustains all, the Creator and Energizer of the whole Universe,
the Giver of happiness, Who is worthy of acceptance, the most excellent, Who is
Pure and the Purifier of all, let us embrace that very God, so that He may
direct our mental faculties in the right direction.
