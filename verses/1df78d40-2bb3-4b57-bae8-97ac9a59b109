Title: The Oldest Thirst There Is
---
Give us gladdness that connects
with the Friend, a taste of the quick,
you that make a cypress strong
and jasmine jasmine.

Give us the inner listening
that is a way in itself
and the oldest thirst there is.

Don't measure it out with a cup.
I am a fish. You are the moon.
You cannot touch me, but your light
can fill the ocean where I live.
