Everyone under heaven calls my Tao great, and unlike anything else. It is
 great only because It is unlike anything else. If it were like anything
 else It would stretch and become thin.
I have three treasures to maintain and conserve： the first is compassion.
 The second is frugality. The third is not presuming To be first under
 heaven.
Compassion leads to courage. Frugality allows generosity. Not presuming to
 be first Creates a lasting instrument.
Nowadays, People reject compassion But want to be brave, Reject frugality
 But want to be generous, Reject humility And want to come first. This is
 death.
Compassion： Attack with it and win. Defend with it and stand firm. Heaven
 aids and protects Through compassion.
