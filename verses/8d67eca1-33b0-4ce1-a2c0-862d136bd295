Unity has in all the cosmos no place of manifestation (maçhar) more perfect
than thyself, when thou plungest thyself into thine own essence in forgetting
all relationship, and when thou seizest thyself with thyself, stripped of
thy appearances, so that thou art thyself in thyself and none of the divine
Qualities or created attributes (which normally pertain to thee) any longer
refer to thee. It is this state of man which is the most perfect place of
manifestation for Unity in all existence.
