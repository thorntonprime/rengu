The ‘Eight Hundred Myriads of Gods’ are nothing but different manifestations of
one and the same Deity Kunitokotachi-no-Kami or the Eternally Standing Divine
Being of the Earth, the Great Unity of all things in the Universe, the
Primordial Being of Heaven and Earth, eternally existing from the beginning to
the end of the universe.
