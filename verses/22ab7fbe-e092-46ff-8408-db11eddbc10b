Lord Dhanvantari, the physician of the three worlds (who expounded the
Ayurvedic Medical Science), has himself declaredï¼š 'By the medicine of
the repetition of the Names Achyuta. Ananta. Govinda, all diseases are
cured -- this is my definite and honest declaration.' ... The Divine Name
will eradicate the disease of birth and death, and bestow on you Moksha,
liberation, or immortality.
