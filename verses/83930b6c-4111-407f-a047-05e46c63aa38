Man was very goodly to look on, bearing the likeness of his Father. ...
And ... downward-tending Nature ..., seing the beauty of the form of God,
smiled with insatiate love of Man, showing the reflection of that most
beautiful form in the water, and its shadow on the earth. And he, seeing
this form, a form like to his own, in earth and water, loved it, and
willed to dwell there. And the deed followed close on the design; and he
took up his abode in matter devoid of reason. And Nature, when she had got
him with whom she was in love, wrapped him in her clasp.
