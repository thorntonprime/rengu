Title: Of the wonderful love that Christ had to man in person of all
  sinners truly turned and called to the grace of contemplation
---
SWEET was that love betwixt our Lord and Mary. Much love had she to Him. Much
more had He to her. For whoso would utterly behold all the behaviour that
was betwixt Him and her, not as a trifler may tell, but as the story of the
gospel will witness -- the which on nowise may be false -- he should find
that she was so heartily set for to love Him, that nothing beneath Him might
comfort her, nor yet hold her heart from Him. This is she, that same Mary,
that when she sought Him at the sepulchre with weeping cheer would not be
comforted of angels.

For when they spake unto her so sweetly and so lovely and said, “Weep not,
Mary; for why, our Lord whom thou seekest is risen, and thou shalt have Him,
and see Him live full fair amongst His disciples in Galilee as He hight,” she
would not cease for them. For why? Her thought that whoso sought verily the
King of Angels, them list not cease for angels. And what more? Surely whoso
will look verily in the story of the gospel, he shall find many wonderful
points of perfect love written of her to our ensample, and as even according
to the work of this writing, as if they had been set and written therefore;
and surely so were they, take whoso take may. And if a man list for to see in
the gospel written the wonderful and the special love that our Lord had to her,
in person of all accustomed sinners truly turned and called to the grace of
contemplation, he shall find that our Lord might not suffer any man or woman --
yea, not her own sister -- speak a word against her, but if He answered for
her Himself. Yea, and what more? He blamed Symon Leprous in his own house,
for that he thought against her. This was great love： this was passing love.
