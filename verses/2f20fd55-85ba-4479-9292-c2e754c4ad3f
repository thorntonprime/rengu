The men of God are priests and prophets who have refused to accept membership
in the commonwealth of the world and to become citizens therein, but have
risen wholly above the sphere of sense-perception and have been translated
into the world of the intelligible and dwell there registered as freemen of
the commonwealth of Ideas, which are imperishable and incorporeal.
