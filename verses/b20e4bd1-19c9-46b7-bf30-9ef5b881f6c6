Title: Psalm One Hundred Thirty One
---
My mind is not noisy with desires,
    and my heart has come to rest.
I do not care about forms
    or anything that is not You.
I have soothed and quieted my soul,
    like a child at it's mother's breast.
And my soul is as peaceful as a child
    sleeping in its mother's arms.
