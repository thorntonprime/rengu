Man’s mind is more treacherous than mountains and rivers and more
difficult to know than the sky. For with the sky you know what to expect
in respect of the coming of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and
the alternation of day and night. But man hides his character behind an
inscrutable appearance. There are those who appear tame and self-effacing,
but conceal a terrible pride. There are those who have some special ability
but appear to be stupid. There are those who are compliant and yielding
but always get their objective. Some are hard outside but soft inside, and
some are slow without but impatient within. Therefore a gentleman sends a
man to a distant mission in order to test his loyalty. He employs him near
by in order to observe his manners. He gives him a lot to do in order to
judge his ability. He suddenly puts a question to him in order to test his
knowledge and makes a commitment with him under difficult circumstances to
test his ability to live up to his word. He trusts him with money in order
to test his heart, and announces to him the coming of a crisis to test his
integrity. He makes him drunk in order to see the inside of his character,
and puts him in female company to see his attitude toward women. Submitted
to these nine tests, a fool always reveals himself.
