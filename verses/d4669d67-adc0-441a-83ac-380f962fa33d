My father and mother were frugal, hard workers.
The grain fields, the vegetable plots,
they left me are as good as any man's.
My wife keeps the loom click-clacking,
and my boy can goo-goo with the best.
I just clap time for the flowers as they dance,
or sit chin in hand and listen to the birds sing.
And who should come by from time to time
to sigh their admiration? The woodcutters
quite often do!
