Jesus (Peace be upon him!) struck the ground with his hand and took up some
of it and spread it out, and behold, he had gold in one of his hands and clay
in the other. Then he said to his companions, ‘Which of them is sweeter to
your hearts?’ They said, ‘The gold.’ He said, ‘They are both alike to me.’
