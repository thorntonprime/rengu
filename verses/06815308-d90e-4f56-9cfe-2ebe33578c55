    Title: The Politics of Women's Spirituality
By: Charlene Spretnak

In my own life, for instance, I know intellectually that the perception
oftime as a linear continuum with three neat divisions of past, present,
and future is merely an artifice, a mental device; I have read the words
of the physicists and the Eastern metaphysicians explaining that all time
(and space) is of one essence, is now. But I neverfelt that knowledge
as an experiential truth until I encountered women’s spirituality and
discovered that temporal boundaries can be rather simply dissolved by the
female mind’s propensity for empathetic comprehension and bonding. Through
ritual moments and countless meditations, through absorbing the sacred
myths of our prepatriarchal foremothers and passing them on to my daughter,
through experiencing in my own daughter/mother mind and body the mysteries
celebrated in the ancient rites, l have come to know, to feel, oneness with
all the millions of women who have lived, who live, and who will live. I
contain those millions. Each of us does. Every moment. Such a power cannot
be stopped.
