It is fitting that the workman should use the tool, and not the tool the
workman; that the rider should guide and spur the horse, and not the horse
the rider; and that the sovereign should direct and govern the people, and
not the people the sovereign. If in such things as these the natural order
is maintained, the result is harmony and beauty; but if the relations are
reversed, the result is confusion, ugliness and distortion.
