A (metal) mirror that has been stained with rust by some passing
incident can be made bright again by rubbing and polishing; but when a
mirror has been rusted ... so that the mirror takes on the character
of a different mirror, with a nature that is fixed and ingrained,—then
the polisher’s skill is of no avail, and the mirror cannot be cleansed
from rust except by submitting it again to the refining fire. And even
so, souls stained by some passing incident can be made bright again by
warnings and reproofs -- so that they recall to memory the state of
life in which they were before; but souls (that have become) foul and
unclean in their very nature can be made bright again only by being
plunged in misery, and remaining long in that condition, and
undergoing it again and again.
