For verily, though We Ourselves should send down the angels unto them,
and the dead should speak unto them, and We should gather against them
all things in array, still they would not believe unless Allâh so
willed. However, most of them are ignorant.

Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary -- devils of
humankind and jinn who inspire in one another gilded words of guile.
And if thy Lord willed, they would not do so; therefore abandon them
and what they invent.
