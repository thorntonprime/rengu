    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Try to Be Close to Things
---
When you feel no commonality between yourself and other people, try to be
close to Things, which will not abandon you. Nights are still there and winds
that blow through the trees and over many lands. Amidst the things and beings
of this world so much is happening that you can take part in. And children
are still the way you were as a child, that happy and that sad, and when you
think of your childhood you live it again with them, the lonely childhood,
and grown-ups count for nothing.
