Title: He Didn't Want to Think Anymore
---
He didn't want to think anymore, a young man I heard about, so he traveled far
  and checked himself into an ashram, where most lose IQ points each day and
  after a while just babble or keep silent.

Sometimes, though, the monastic life can do just the opposite： increase the
  brain and heart's power. It simply depends on who one turns the reins of life
  over to.

My general advice is： Anyone wearing spiritual robes is potentially lethal;
  best to consider they already have two strikes against them ... and if they
  make just one tiny false move -- best to run, or hit them with your bat.

And a word about dead gurus reincarnating. Most are just that, deadbeats. A lot
  of very tricky psycho games can go on with them, in which your bank account
  might weep.
