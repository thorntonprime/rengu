Title: We Live to Be Near Her
---
When beauty walks into the room and sits down close to you and is
willing to let you gaze at her as much as you want,

no one has to tell you all is alright now, no one has to parrot
again ... someday your pain won't exist.

For we live to be near her. She oozes grace. Part of her benediction
is that all the hormones you want to come alive do.

Passion in full throttle says to the past, says to worries -- go fuck
yourself, and the past will crouch down or run ... like a pup in the
presence of a fierce dog.

When God makes itself more known and all our attention rivets on some
aspect of Splendor,

all our internal dialogue -- what can it do, but cease to deplete
one,

then something lifts our heart toward the Sky.
