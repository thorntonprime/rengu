  Title: For Lovers of God Everywhere
Title: Indescribable Vastness
---
Indescribable vastness,
streaming from all sides,
streaming from no sides,
an ocean full and overflowing
with a luminous nothing.

where no word has ever gone, but
out of which the Word emerges.
And so this Silence washes
onto the shores of perception,
making it stretch to receive
in metaphors of light,
union, calm,
spaciousness.

You are the vastness
into which you gaze.
"Deep calls unto deep in the
roar of your waters" (Ps 42ï¼š7).
