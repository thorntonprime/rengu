Lord, I am as willing to be poor in all those things of which I have
been deprived as I am ready to be rich. O Lord, if it be Thy will and
to Thy glory; not my will according to nature. O Lord, but Thy will
and my will according to spirit be done. For I am Thine own. O Lord,
and would as well be in hell as in heaven, if it were to Thy glory.
Lord, do unto me according to Thy good pleasure.
