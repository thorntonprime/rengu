Jo of the North Sea said, "Horses and oxen have four feet - this is
what I mean by the Heavenly. Putting a halter on the horse's head,
piercing the ox's nose - this is what I mean by the human. So I say do
not let what is human wipe out what is Heavenly; do not let what is
purposeful wipe out what is fated; do not let [the desire for] gain
lead you after fame. Be cautious, guard it, and do not lose it - this
is what I mean by returning to the True."
