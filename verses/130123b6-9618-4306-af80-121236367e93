Title: A Bleak Extra Day
Format: mixed
---
Bleak leap-year extra day. Black, with a few snowflakes, like yesterday when
no snow stayed on the ground but there was sleet and the rain-buckets nearly
filled. All the grass is white with, not snow, death.

A magazine in English -- in Burma or somewhere (India?) -- has an article by
a Buddhist laywoman of her practice of meditation -- emphasizing minfdulness
of suffering in its existential reality, not escaping into ecstasy, etc. On
one of the pages with this article, the following advertisement：

  If you use Balm
  Use only the strongest Balm
  de Songa’s Dali Brand
  BURMA BALM (picture of jar -- radiating light)
  50 powerful yet only K1 a jar
  Relieves all pain -- and quickly!
  From de Songa’s of course.

Though it is still cold (with a bitterly biting wind) there were a few moments
this afternoon when the coming of spring might almost be credible -- perhaps
because I so desire it after this cold winter. Out in St. Bernard’s field,
just as the Clock was striking two, the sound of the bells came clear in a lull
of the wind, and, with the Wind down, the sun was suddenly warm. Fern-like
walnut trees in the hollow stood as if ready for summer, and I looked at the
distant valley and at the slight haze in the sky. Perhaps warm weather will
once again be possible.
