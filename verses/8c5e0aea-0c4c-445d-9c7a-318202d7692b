Description: August 2

Don't be confused by the nature of solitude, when something inside you wants
to break free of your loneliness. This very wish, when you use it as a tool
for understanding, can illumine your solitude and expand it to include all
that is. Bound by conventions, people tend to reach for what is easy. It
is clear, however, that here we must be unafraid of what is difficult. For
all living things in nature must unfold in their particular way and become
themselves at any cost and despite all opposition.
