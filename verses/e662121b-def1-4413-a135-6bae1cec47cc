Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
Chuang Tzu said, "Maybe you've never seen a wildcat or a weasel. It
crouches down and hides, watching for something to come along. It leaps
and races east and west, not hesitating to go high or low-until it
falls into the trap and dies in the net. Then again there's the yak,
big as a cloud covering the sky. It certainly knows how to be big,
though it doesn't know how to catch rats. Now You have this big tree
and you're distressed because it's useless. Why don't you plant it in
Not-Even-Anything Village, or the field of Broad-and-Boundless, relax
and do nothing by its side, or lie down for a free and easy sleep under
it? Axes will never shorten its life, nothing can ever harm it. If
there's no use for it, how can it come to grief or pain?"
