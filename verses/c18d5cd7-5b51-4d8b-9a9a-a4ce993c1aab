Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
There is such a thing as completion and injury - Mr. Chao playing the
lute is an example. There is such a thing as no completion and no
injury - Mr. Chao not playing the lute is an example. Chao Wen played
the lute; Music Master K'uang waved his baton; Hui Tzu leaned on his
desk. The knowledge of these three was close to perfection. All were
masters, and therefore their names have been handed down to later ages.
Only in their likes they were different from him [the true sage]. What
they liked, they tried to make clear. What he is not clear about, they
tried to make clear, and so they ended in the foolishness of "hard" and
"white." Their sons, too, devoted all their lives to their fathers'
theories, but till their death never reached any completion. Can these
men be said to have attained completion? If so, then so have all the
rest of us. Or can they not be said to have attained completion? If so,
then neither we nor anything else have ever attained it.
