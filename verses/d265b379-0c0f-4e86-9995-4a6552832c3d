Title: Learning Love's Language
---
I live in the woods out of necessity. I get out of bed in the middle of
the night because it is imperative that I hear the silence of the night,
alone, and, with my face on the floor, say psalms, alone, in the silence
of the night.

It is necessary for me to live here alone without a woman, for the silence
of the forest is my bride and the sweet dark warmth of the whole world
is my love, and out of the heart of that dark warmth comes that secret
which is only heard in silence, but it is the root of all the secrets
that are whispered by all the lovers in their beds all over the world. I
have an obligation to preserve the stillness, the silence, the poverty,
the virginal point of pure nothingness which is at the center of all
other loves. I cultivate this plant silently in the middle of the night
and water it with psalms and prophecies in silence. It becomes the most
beautiful of all the trees in the garden, at once the primordial paradise
tree, the axis mundi, the cosmic axle, and the Cross.

It is necessary for me to see the first point of light that begins to
be dawn. It is necessary to be present alone at the resurrection of Day
in solemn silence at which the sun appears, for at this moment all the
affairs of cities, of governments, of war departments, are seen to be the
bickering of mice. I receive from the eastern woods, the tall oaks, the
one word DAY. It is never the same. It is always in a totally new language.
