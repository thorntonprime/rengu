Title: Huangbo Slurping Dregs
---
Huangbo instructed the assembly and said, "You people of
various ranks are fellows who indeed slurp the dregs of the wine to the
limit. In this way you travel about on your feet. At what place is
today? Do you even know that within the great nation of Tang there are
no Zen teachers?"

At that time there was a monk who stood out and said, "But
there seems to be in the various directions those who correct disciples
and guide assemblies, how do they make it come alive?"

Bo said, "I did not say no Zen; only no teachers."
