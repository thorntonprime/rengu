Oh I cant keep it in, I cant keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, worlds got to see, see all the love
Love that's in me. I said, why walk alone, why worry when its
Warm over here. you've got so much to say, say what you mean,
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything.
Oh why, why must you waste you're life away,
You've got to live for today, then let it go
Oh, lover, I want to spend this time with you,
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know.
And I cant keep it in, I cant hide it and I cant lock it away.
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood,
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love, oh.
No, I cant keep it in, I cant keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've gotta show the world, worlds got to know,
Know of the love, love that lies low, so
Why cant you say, if you know, then why cant you say.
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light,
Light needs to shine, I said shine light , shine light.
Love, that's no way to live your life,
You allow too much to go by, and that wont do.
No, lover. I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you.
n I cant keep it in, I cant keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, worlds got to see, see all the love
Love that's in me. I said, why walk alone, why worry when its
Warm over here. you've got so much to say, say what you mean,
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything. why not?
Now why why why not?
