The disciples said to Jesus： Tell us how our end will be.

Jesus said： Have you then discovered the beginning so that you inquire
about the end? For where the beginning is, there shall be the end. Blessed
is he who shall stand at the beginning, and he shall know the end and he
shall not taste death.
