Description: Hindu Prayer
---
He whom the Saivites worship as Siva (the Auspicious One), the Vedantins as the
Absolute, the Bauddhas as the Buddha (the Enlightened On√©), the Logicians,
experts in proofs, as the author of the world, those devoted to Jain doctrines
as the Arhat (the Worthy), the Mimamsakas as ordained Duty, -- May that Hari,
the Lord of the three worlds, bestow on you the desired fruit.
