Remember, an thou seekest aught of thine thou never shalt find God, for thou
art not seeking God merely. Thou art seeking for something with God, making a
candle of God, as it were, with which to find something, and then, having
found it.  throwing the candle away. Thus shalt thou fare： aught that thou
findest with God is naught, whatsoever it be, whether profit or wages or the
interior life or anything else： naught dost thou seek and naught shalt thou
find.
