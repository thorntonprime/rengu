Q： How can a European best try to fulfil the conditions necessary for
Japa Yoga, in the midst of all the confused life and activity in
Europe?

Ramdas： If we depend upon God, everything becomes possible. The
conditions prevailing in Europe are more or less the same as those
prevailing in other parts of the world. It is not external conditions
that deter us from trying to realise God. but our own mind. If the
mind is averse to the practice of constantly remembering God. then the
external circumstances seem to hamper us. If the mind longs to realise
God. and pines for His contact, the circumstances automatically prove
to be conducive and helpful. Even difficulties that face us will
become helpers in our path, provided our aspiration for God is very
keen. In a wonderful way, the very obstacles become our aids, and
people around us will cooperate with us in our efforts to reach Him.
In strange and mysterious ways. God Himself provides us with all the
things necessary for our spiritual progress.
