Commentary: The six thousand years are roughly the extent of the present age,
  or ‘Kali Yuga’, following another traditional chronology.
---
The tribulations and temporal sufferings of God’s people have now lasted six
thousand years; but during this whole time, men have again and again been
refreshed, comforted, and strengthened by the Spirit of God -- and so it is
now, and ever will be, until the great universal Sabbath and rest-day of the
seventh millenium. Then this occasional spiritual refreshing will cease, and
everlasting joy will reign, since God will be all in all.
