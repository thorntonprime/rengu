Though the châtak bird is about to die of a parched throat, and around
it there are seven oceans, rivers, and lakes overflowing with water,
still it will not touch that water. Its throat is cracking with
thirst, and still it will not drink that water. It looks up, mouth
agape, for the rain to fall when the star Svâti is in the ascendant.
‘To the châtak bird all waters are mere dryness beside Svâti water.’
