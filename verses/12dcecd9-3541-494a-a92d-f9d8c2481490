I am no sooner before God but I lose all other objects and do nothing else than
follow the drawings and inclinations which He Himself has laid in me, to flow
in God and sink down in Him -- like a vessel full of water which when emptied
nothing remains in it, so will I wholly empty and sink myself quite in God.
This is my sole endeavor, I desire only this, and after this manner I pray.
