Long on the road, poor scholar!
Cold and hungry, to and from the poles ...
Free, retired, in love, with writing poems,
scratch, scratch, with all your heart!
But who'd even pick up a poor boy's poems?
I beg you, sir, please stop your moaning.
If you wrote your poems on fat rice balls,
even a beggar's dog wouldn't eat 'em.
