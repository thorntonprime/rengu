Manâ€™s chief work is but to praise God. To Him it belongs to satisfy
thee by His beauty, to thee to praise Him in acts of thanksgiving. If
thy works be not the praise of God, thou art beginning to love
thyself. ... For it is not He that increaseth by our praises, but we.
God is neither the better if thou praise Him, nor worse if thou
disparage Him; but thou, by praising Him that is good, art the better;
by disparaging thou art the worse, for He remaineth good, as He is.
