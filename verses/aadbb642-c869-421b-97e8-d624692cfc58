Commentary: These passages treating of multiple births are applicable both
  'horizontally' or 'historically', where the reference to Arjuna,
  for example, is one of the transmigration of the being through multiple
  states of existence, and ‘vertically’ or principally, in the sense that
  ‘there is no other transmigrant but the Lord’ (Sankarâchârya： Brahma
  Sûtra Bhâsya, I. I. 5) -- Krishna in the citation above speaking as the
  universal omniscient Self： One as he is Person there, and many as he is
  in his children here' (Salapalha Brâhmana. X. 5. 2. 16). In neither case
  is there any question of 'reincarnation', the belief, incompatible
  metaphysically because implying a scission in the unity of the Divine
  Nature, that an individual being can repeat a determined state of
  existence. Cf. Guenon： L'Erreur spirite, and Coomaraswamy： 'On the One
  and Only Transmigrant'. Cf, also Qur'ân. XXIII. 100： Behind them is a
  barrier until the day when they are raised'： likewise Heraclitus：
  'You cannot dip your feet twice in the same stream, for other waters
  are ever flowing on.'

O Arjuna, both you and I have gone through many births. I know them all,
but thou knowest them not, O Parantapa.
