Commentary: |
  These passages treating of multiple births are applicable
  both 'horizontally' or 'historically', where the reference to Arjuna,
  for example, is one of the transmigration of the being through
  multiple states of existence, and 'vertically' or principally,
  in the sense that 'there is no other transmigrant but the Lord'
  (Sankar\xE2ch\xE2rya\uFF1A Brahma S\xFBtra Bh\xE2sya, I. I. 5)
  -- Krishna in the citation above speaking as the universal omniscient
  Self\uFF1A One as he is Person there, and many as he is in his
  children here' (Salapalha Br\xE2hmana. X. 5. 2. 16). In neither
  case is there any question of 'reincarnation', the belief, incompatible
  metaphysically because implying a scission in the unity of the
  Divine Nature, that an individual being can repeat a determined
  state of existence. Cf. Guenon\uFF1A L'Erreur spirite, and
  Coomaraswamy\uFF1A 'On the One and Only Transmigrant'. Cf, also
  Qur'\xE2n. XXIII. 100\uFF1A Behind them is a barrier until the day when
  they are raised'\uFF1A likewise Heraclitus\uFF1A 'You cannot dip your feet
  twice in the same stream, for other waters are ever flowing on.'"

O Arjuna, both you and I have gone through many births. I know them all,
but thou knowest them not, O Parantapa.
