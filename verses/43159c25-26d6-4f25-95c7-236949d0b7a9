First it is browne, roddy, and after some deale white,
And then it is called our chosen Markasite;
One ounce thereof is better then fifty pound
It is not to be sould in all Christian grounde;
But he that would have it he shalbe faine
To doe it make, or take himselfe the paine;
But one greate grace in that labour is saine,
Make it once well and never more againe.
Olde fathers called it thinge of vile price,
For it is nought worth by way of Marchandise;
Noe man that findeth it woll beare it awaie,
Noe more then thei would an Ounce of Claye;
Men will not beleeve that it is of high price,
No man knoweth it therefore but he be wise.
Here have I disclosed a greate secret wonder,
Which never was writ by them which been erth under.
