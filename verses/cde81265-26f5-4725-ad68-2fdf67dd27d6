Peace through stalemate based on a coincident recognition by each side of
the opponent’s strength is at least preferable to peace through common
exhaustion -- and has often provided a better foundation for lasting
peace. ...

Where the two sides are too evenly matched to offer a reasonable chance
of early success to either, the statesman is wise who can learn something
from the psychology of strategy, if you find your opponent in a strong
position costly to force, you should leave him a line of retreat --
as the quickest way of loosening his resistance.
