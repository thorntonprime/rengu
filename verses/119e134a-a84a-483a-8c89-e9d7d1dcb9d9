Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
The shaman Hsien beckoned  and said, "Come - I will tell you. Heaven
has the six directions and the five constants. When emperors and kings
go along with these, there is good order; when they move contrary to
these, there is disaster. With the instructions of the Nine Lo, order
can be made to reign and virtue completed. The ruler will shine
mirror-like over the earth below, and the world will bear him up. He
may be called an August One on high."
