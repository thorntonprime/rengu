By: Swami Sivananda

The most comfortable, best furnished, and wonderful cave, inspiring
holy fear, is in your heart. It is the hridaya-guha spoken of in the
Upanishads. and in which formerly dwelt Datt√¢treya. Shankara. and
Yajnavalkya. It is here in modern times that rishis still dwell, who
have withdrawn their mind and senses from the outward world.
