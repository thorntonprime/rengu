All day long the ‘lamenter’ sends his voice to Wakan-Tanka for aid, and he
walks as we have described upon the sacred paths which form a cross. This form
has much power in it, for whenever we return to the center, we know that it is
as if we are returning to Wakan-Tanka, who is the center of everything; and
although we may think that we are going away from Him, sooner or later we and
all things must return to Him
