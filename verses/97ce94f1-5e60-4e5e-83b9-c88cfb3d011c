My heart desires to see thee. O lord of the Acacia trees; my heart desires
to see thee. O Amon. Thou art the protector of the poor, a father to the
motherless, a husband to the widow. Sweet it is to speak thy name; it is
like the taste of life, like the taste of bread to a child, like the breath
of freedom to a prisoner. Turn thyself to us. O Eternal One, who wast here
before others existed. Though thou makest me to see darkness yet cause light
to shine on me that I may see thee.
