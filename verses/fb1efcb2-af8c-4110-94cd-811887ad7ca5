A great saint has said that he who has got Godâ€™s name on his lips is a
Jivan-mukta, because continuous remembrance of God eliminates the ego-sense
and grants him the realisation of his immortal, changeless Self. Name is a
link between the devotee and God. It brings the devotee face to face with
God and enables him to attain the knowledge of his oneness with Him.
