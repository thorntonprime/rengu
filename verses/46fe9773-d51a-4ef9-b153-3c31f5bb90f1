Title: The Speech of God is Silence
---
For the first time in my life I am finding you. O Solitude. I can count on
the fingers of one hand the few short moments of purity, of neutrality,
in which I have found you. Now I know I am coming to the day in which I
will be able to live without words, even outside my prayer. For I still
need to go out into this no-man's-land of language, which does not quite
join me to others and which throws a veil over my own solitude. I my "live
without words." By words I mean the half-helpless and half-wise looks by
which we seek one mother‘s thoughts. But I do not abdicate all language,
for there is the Word of God. This I proclaim and I live to proclaim it. I
live to utter the Mass, the Canon, which implicitly contains‘ all words,
all reveltition, and teaches everything. It is at the Canon and at the
words at Consecration that all solitudes come into a single focus.There is
the City of God gathered together in that one Word spoken in silence. The
speech of God is silence. His word is solitude. Him I will never deny, by
His grace! Everything else is fiction, half-hiding the truth it tries to
reveal. We are travelers from the half-world of language mto solitude and
infinity. We are strangers. Paper. I have not in you a lasting city. Yet,
there is a return from solitude to make manifest His Name to them who have
not known it. And then to re-enter solitude again and dwell in silence.
