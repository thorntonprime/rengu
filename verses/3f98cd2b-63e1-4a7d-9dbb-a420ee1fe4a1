Jesus saw children who were being suckled. He said to his disciples： These
children who are being suckled are like those who enter the Kingdom. They
said to Him： Shall we then, being children, enter the Kingdom? Jesus said
to them： When you make the two one, and when you make the inner as the
outer and the outer as the inner and the above as the below, and when you
make the male and the female into a single one, so that the male will not
be male and the female (not) be female. ... then shall you enter (the Kingdom).
