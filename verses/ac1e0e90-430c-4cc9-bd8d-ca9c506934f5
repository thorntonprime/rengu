Now the free will may reach to which it pleases; both gates stand open
to him. Many who are in Christ’s line are also brought through
imagination and lust, as Adam was, into iniquity： they are indeed
called, but they persevere not in the election, for the election is
set upon him who departs from sin： he is elected that dies to sin in
Christ's death, and rises in Christ's resurrection, who receives God
in Christ, not only in the mouth, but in divine desire in the will and
new-birth. as a new fiery generation： Knowledge apprehends it not.
only the earnest desire and breaking of the sinful will, that
apprehends it. ... Adam is chosen in Christ： but that many a twig
withers on the tree, is not the tree's fault, for it withdraws its sap
from no twig, only the twig gives forth itself too eagerly with the
desire： it runs on in self-will. viz. it is taken by the inflammation
of the sun and the fire, before it can draw sap again in its mother,
and refresh itself.
