So far as the soul sinks down in faith into the unknown good, so far she is
one with the unknown good and is unknown to self or any creature. She well
knows that she is but knows not what she is. Not till she knows all that
there is to know does she cross over to the unknown good. This crossing is
obscure to many a religious.
