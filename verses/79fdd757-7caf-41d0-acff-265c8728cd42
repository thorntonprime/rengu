Mr. Lame-Hunchback-No-Lips talked to Duke Ling of Wei, and Duke Ling
was so pleased with him that when he looked at normal men he thought
their necks looked too lean and skinny. Mr. Pitcher-Sized-Wen talked
to Duke Huan of Ch'i, and Duke Huan was so pleased with him that when
he looked at normal men he thought their necks looked too lean and
skinny. Therefore, if virtue is preeminent, the body will be forgotten.
But when men do not forget what can be forgotten, but forget what
cannot be forgotten - that may be called true forgetting.
