All men's thoughts, which are turmoiled with manifold cares, take indeed
divers courses, but yet endeavour to attain the same end of happiness, which
is that good which, being once obtained, nothing can be further desired.
Which is the chiefest of all goods, and containeth in itself whatsoever is
good, and if it wanted anything it could not be the chiefest. because there
would something remain besides it which might be wished for. Wherefore, it
is manifest that blessedness is an estate replenished with all that is good.
This, as we said, all men endeavour to obtain by divers ways. For there is
naturally ingrafted in men’s minds an earnest desire of that which is truly
good： but deceitful error withdraweth it to that which falsely seemeth
such. ... Wherefore, since all things are desired in respect of goodness, they
are not so much wished for as goodness itself. But we granted that to be
blessedness for which other things are desired, wherefore in like manner only
blessedness is sought after： by which it plainly appeareth. that goodness
and blessedness have one and the self-same substance. ... But we have showed
that God and true blessedness are one and the self-same thing. ... We may
then securely conclude that the substance of God consisteth in nothing else
but in goodness.
