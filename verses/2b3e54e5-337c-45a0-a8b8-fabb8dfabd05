Title: A Single Mind
---
The strongest prayer I could ever pray
and the one that will give me no less

than everything is the one that proceeds
from a single mind, simple and uncluttered

of my I, for in this emptying, when I want
nothing more for myself, You cannot help

but come and give me all You will and all
You are of Yourself, and !n the meeting

of this gift You become who You truly are
and I become who I truly am and come

to know that in this we are one single One.
