To wander free among the mountains,
you don't have to buy them.
For a steep climb you need a stout staff,
and a good strong vine helps when it's steeper.
The pines beside the creeks are always green,
but the rocks in their beds come in all colors.
You might get cut off from all your friends,
but in the spring the birds will sing for you.
