The Waters (representing the principle of substance) being ripe unto conception
(lit. ‘in their season’), Vâyu (that is, the Wind, as physical symbol of
spiration, prâna) moved over their surface. Wherefrom came into being a lovely
(vâma) thing (that is, the world-picture), there in the Waters Mitra-Varuna
beheld-themselves-reflected (paryapasyat).
