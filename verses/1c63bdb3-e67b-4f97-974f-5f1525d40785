Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in
fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.

Humble thy heart, and endure： incline thy ear, and receive the words
of understanding： and make not haste in the time of clouds.

Wait on God with patience： join thyself to God, and endure, that thy
life may be increased in the latter end.

Take all that shall be brought upon thee： and in thy sorrow endure,
and in thy humiliation keep patience.

For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the
furnace of humiliation.
