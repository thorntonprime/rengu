Mad! That’s the thing! Shivanath once said that one ‘loses one’s head’ by
thinking too much of God. ‘What?’ said I. ‘Can anyone ever become unconscious
by thinking of Consciousness? God is of the nature of Eternity, Purity, and
Consciousness. Through His Consciousness one becomes conscious of everything;
through His Intelligence the whole world appears intelligent.’ Shivanath said
that some Europeans had gone insane, that they had ‘lost their heads’, by
thinking too much about God. In their case it may be true; for they think of
worldly things. There is a line in a song： ‘Divine fervour fills my body and
robs me of consciousness.’ The consciousness referred to here is the
consciousness of the outer world.
