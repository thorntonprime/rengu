Our holy things are defiled,
  the name that is called upon us is profanedï¼š
our nobles are dishonoured.
  our priests burnt,
our Levites gone into captivity;
our virgins are defiled,
  our wives ravished;
our righteous are seized,
  our saints scattered,
  our children are cast out.
  our youths are enslaved,
  our heroes made powerless.
