Title: Giving Thanks Is Dangerous
---
Giving thanks is dangerous, for inherent in doing so is to rea? rm duality. And
 duality is living on borrowed time.
Thanks to God are most always an admitting, always a making of a statement
 that basically
says, "I am glad things are no longer as they were."
From perfect to perfect we go. From unconscious divinity to conscious God.
A masterpiece you always were. Anyone who truly sees would never want you
 to change,
though the teacher may play the horrific game of right and wrong
so that you won't kill yourself. Or you won't dissolve in bliss, until
 you have given to this world all you were supposed to; or something like that.
