    Title: The Book of Hours
Title: My Own Deep Soul
---
You, my own deep soul,
trust me. I will not betray you.
My blood is alive with many voices
telling me I am made of longing.

What mystery breaks over me now?
In its shadow I come into life.
For the first time I am alone with you --

you, my power to feel.
