Title: Threw Them out of Whack
---
Sometimes when visitors come and words have done what they can, I say,
There is a lute in the room where I rest. Go there, please, and fetch that,
 for I am having trouble walking these days.
I will play you a tune that came to me last night when I was bowed in prayer,
for I noticed this morning when I hummed it some angels with hangovers
 gathered near and they felt better.
It is not that they were drinking things we do; it is that they stepped into
 the minds
of some humans for a while, and that really threw them out of whack.
