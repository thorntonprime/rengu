Title: The Table where You Ate
---
For your sake we are here, not for our own. Why should I ever complain about
 working in the shop where you did?
And the table, earth, where you ate -- isn't that good enough for me?
Your legs stretched out across every particle of space I might ever encounter;
 the wise could build monuments here because of this.
If my senses were less dull the scent of your breath would enter me,
for you exhaled something of your soul into this world, and what you do
 does last.
For your sake, Beloved, we are here, not for our own, no matter what directions
 our thoughts and actions may turn.
When dawn pulls the veil from my eye, the scent of your breath will enter
 me forever, and lift every sail.
