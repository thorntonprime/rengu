Commentary: The "Path of altruism" refers to the universilization of the will.
By: Milarepa
---
The perseverance with which I had meditated had prepared my nerves for an
internal change in the whole nervous system. ... I saw that the minuter
nerves of my system were being straightened out; even the knot of the
Sushumnâ-Nâdi was loosening below the navel; and I experienced a state of
supersensual calmness and clearness resembling the former states which I had
experienced, but exceeding them in its depth and ecstatic intensity, and
therein differing from them. Thus was a hitherto unknown and transcendent
knowledge born in me. ... What till now had been regarded as objective
discrimination shone forth as the Dharma-Kâya (Body of Truth). I understood
the Sangsâra and Nirvâna to be dependent and relative states; and that the
Universal Cause is Mind, which is distinct from the ideas of Interestedness or
Partiality. This Universal Cause, when directed along the path of Disbelief
(or Selfishness), resulteth in the Sangsâra; while if it be directed along
the path of Altruism, it resulteth in Nirvâna. I was perfectly convinced
that the real source of both Sangsâra and Nirvâna lay in the Voidness. The
knowledge I now had obtained was born of my previous energetic devotions,
which had served as its main cause; and it only awaited the accident, at the
crisis, of the wholesome and nourishing food, and the timely prescription
contained in the scroll, to bring it forth.
