Now the king (Kappina), with his thousand ministers, reached the bank of the
Ganges.  But at this time the Ganges was full. When the king saw this, he said：
'The Ganges here is full, and swarms with savage fish. Moreover we have with us
no slaves or men to make boats or rafts for us. But of this Teacher the virtues
extend from the Avici Hell beneath to the Peak of Existence above. If this
Teacher be the Supremely Enlightened Buddha, may not the tips of the hoofs of
these horses be wetted!’

They caused the horses to spring forward on the surface of the water. Of not a
single horse was so much as the tip of the hoof wetted. On a king’s highway
proceeding, as it were, they went to the far shore. Farther on they reached
another river. There, was needed no other Act of Truth. By the same Act of
Truth, that river also, half a league in breadth, did they cross over. Then
they reached the third river, the mighty river Candabhâgâ. That river also, by
the same Act of Truth, did they cross over. ...

Queen Anojâ, surrounded by a thousand chariots, reaching the bank of the Ganges
and seeing no boat or raft brought for the King, by her own intuition
concluded： ‘The King must have crossed by making an Act of Truth. But this
Teacher was reborn not for them alone. If this Teacher be the Supremely
Enlightened Buddha, may our chariots not sink into the water!’

She caused the chariots to spring forward on the surface of the water. Of the
chariots not even so much as the outer rims of the wheels were wetted. The
second river also, the third river also, she crossed by the same Act of Truth.
