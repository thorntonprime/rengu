Unfortunately there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good
than he imagines himselfor wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the
less it is embodied in the individualâ€™s conscious life, the blacker and
denser it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to
correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests,
so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed
and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected, and is liable to
burst forth suddenly in a moment of unawareness. At all events, it forms
an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.

We carry our past with us, to wit, the primitive and inferior man with
his desires and emotions, and it is only with an enormous effort that
we can detach ourselves from this burden. If it comes to a neurosis, we
invariably have to deal with a considerably intensified shadow. And if
such a person wants to be cured it is necessary to find a way in which
his conscious personality and his shadow can live together.
