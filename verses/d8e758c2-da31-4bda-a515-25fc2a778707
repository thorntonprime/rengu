A monk asked Zhaozhou, "When first born, does the infant
also possess the sixth consciousness or not?

Zhaozhou said, "A ball strikes the surface of the
rushing water."

The monk, in repeating this, asked Touzi, "So what was
the meaning and purpose of 'A ball strikes the surface of the rushing
water.'"

Zi said, "Moment by moment, unceasing flowing."
