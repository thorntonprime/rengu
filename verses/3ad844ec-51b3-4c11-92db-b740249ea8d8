Title: Living with Change
Commentary: |
  In the first verse, the words “dull and confused” and “sharp and
  keen” are, as Waley points out, the words used in chapter 20 to describe
  the Taoist and the non-Taoists.

  In the last verse most translators say the Taoist is square but doesn’t
  cut, shines but doesn’t dazzle. Waley says that this misses the point. The
  point is that Taoists gain their ends without the use of means. That is
  indeed a light that does not shine -- an idea that must be pondered and
  brooded over. A small dark light.

When the government’s dull and confused,
the people are placid.
When the government’s sharp and keen,
the people are discontented.
Alas! misery lies under happiness,
and happiness sits on misery, alas!
Who knows where it will end?
Nothing is certain.

The normal changes into the monstrous,
the fortunate into the unfortunate,
and our bewilderment
goes on and on.

And so the wise
shape without cutting,
square without sawing,
true without forcing.
They are the light that does not shine.
