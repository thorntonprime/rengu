Title: One Dog's Good Afternoon
---
This afternoon -- a quiet walk in the sun： again down by St. Bernard’s
pond. The Cannons' dog tagged along -- the pretty collie bitch with a
feathery tail- running busily into everything, immense interest in all kinds
of smells, mysteries, secrets in the bushes and in the grass. She ran on the
melting ice, rolled in the manure spread over the pasture (rolled twice!),
came out of the brush with her tail full of dead leaves, and, in a final
paroxysm of energy, chased a cat into the cow barn. A completely successful
afternoon for her anyway!

I had Martin Buber’s Ten Runes in my pocket and couldn’t read a line
of it, only looked at the sun, the dead grass, the green soft“ ice, the
blue sky, and felt utterly blank. Will there never be any peace on earth
in our lifetime? Will they never do anything but kill, and then kill some
more? Apparently they are caught in that impasse： the system is completely
violent and involved in violence, and there is no way out but violence, and
that leads only to more Violence. Really -- what is ahead but the apocalypse?
