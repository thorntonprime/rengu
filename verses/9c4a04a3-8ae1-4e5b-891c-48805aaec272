Can a man ever understand Godâ€™s ways? 1 too think of God sometimes as good
and sometimes as bad. He has kept us deluded by His great illusion.
Sometimes He wakes us up and sometimes He keeps us unconscious. One moment
the ignorance disappears, and the next moment it covers our mind. If you
throw a brick-bat into a pond covered with moss, you get a glimpse of the
water. But a few moments later the moss comes dancing back and covers the
water.

One is aware of pleasure and pain, birth and death, disease and grief, as
long as one is identified with the body. All these belong to the body alone,
and not to the Soul. ... Renun. Attaining Self-Knowledge, one looks on
pleasure and pain, birth and death, as a dream.
