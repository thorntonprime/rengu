Title: Like the Ganges
Description: October 10-11
---
The Sun needs a sacred tablet where it can write its resplendent verse,
 and Hafiz has become a blessed stone.
When the Friend begins to sway from being so full of wine, music flows like
 the Ganges from His mouth.
God then needs fertile banks and walls in this world to govern all that
 raging light.
I build canals into the cities and into the plains. I run beside small
 villages and sing.
I nourish and cool the roots of stars and mankind. Women wash their clothes
 in me,
thirsty cattle and skinny dogs come accompanied by spellbound children,
 but soon we all begin to splash and kiss.
Birds fly to my shores, then get excited and spread the news：
The verse of Hafiz is a wonderful bath; the glance of Hafiz is a beatific
 ocean bath
where all can clean their bodies in the sounds of my lyre and mirth, in the
 tenderness of my drum’s alluring beat.

His music has filled my pores. I am inebriated with the unbearable Truth.
Tonight I am a staggering, awesome planet, for all day long I construct
 alliances
using my divine gravity upon all sinew, minds, and souls.
I ecstatically speak with words, and also with purest language-silence --
saying in a thousand different ways： “Dear countrymen,
all nearby cousins, comets and galaxies, every amoeba, creature and plant --
bring your cup, bring your cup, and I will pour you God.”
O when the Friend begins to sway from being so full of love, divine music
 flows from my mouth.
