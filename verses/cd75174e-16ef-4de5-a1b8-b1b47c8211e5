Title: Mount Sinai
---
Mount Sinai sought my counsel last night, knowing I had become its elder.
They may look like they never have problems, the planets, but they at times
 do, like us, and then look for a friend to talk with.
All things are living, even stones. It has to be that way; energy pulsates
 from their bodies, since all are part of the Omnipresent Living Being.
Everything is holding out their hands, offering something,
how much easier the world would be to live in if we were as kind and accepted
 all. But discernment should not be abandoned.
The chorus from the peaks will sing in praise when the Messiah comes again. And
 He will.
And Mount Sinai will seek your counsel some night, when you no longer need
 to sleep.
