Title: Natural Virtue
---
I don’t wait for you because I want to
but because I find myself waiting for you.
That is： waiting for you is love, not chastity.

Some laugh and call me an old-fashioned woman
  guarding a petty virtue,
but it’s not that I don’t understand these times.
I don’t aspire to make deep statements about life and virtue;
I don’t rashly deny the sanctity of free love.
Once I tried to be natural and to live freely.

But in the end we say and do as we like.
As I wait for you I grow fat on anguish and tall on sadness.
My virtue is a “natural virtue.”
