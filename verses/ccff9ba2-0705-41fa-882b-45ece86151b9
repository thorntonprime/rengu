Title: Within Me in That Soft Place
---
Within me in the soft place
we call the soul is a fortress

so strong and beyond all
knowing that no one can

enter, not I, not those I
love or fear, not even You.

In this citadel, I am truly
who I am beyond how I

know myself and how
others know me and there

You are truly You beyond
the names we have chosen

to give You, and here we
arc not united but one.
