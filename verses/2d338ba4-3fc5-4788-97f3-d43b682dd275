In spiritual practice in general -- and asceticism in particular -- the
goal is always the recovery of wholeness. Today, I believe, the attainment
of this goal requires great discretion in the use of physical means such
as fasting and sleep deprivation. We need to recover, after thirteen
centuries of Platonic dualism and three centuries of Cartesian dualism,
a profoundly holistic understanding of ourselves as embodied spirit in
the world, part of this world of bodies and open to Absolute Spirit or God.
