Jo of the North Sea said, "From the point of view of the Way, what is
noble or what is mean? These are merely what are called endless
changes. Do not hobble your will, or you will be departing far from the
Way! What is few, or what is many? These are merely what are called
boundless turnings. Do not strive to unify your actions, or you will
be at sixes and sevens with the Way! Be stern like the ruler of a state
- he grants no private favor. Be benign and impartial like the god of
the soil at the sacrifice - he grants no private blessing. Be broad and
expansive like the endlessness of the four directions they have
nothing which bounds or hedges them. Embrace the ten thousand things
universally - how could there be one you should give special support
to? This is called being without bent. When the ten thousand things are
unified and equal, then which is short and which is long?
