Has not the famous political fable of the snake, with two heads and one
body, some useful instruction contained in it? She was going to a brook to
drink, and in her way was to pass through a hedge, a twig of which opposed
her direct course; one head chose to go on the right side of the twig,
the other on the left; so that time was spent in the contest, and before
the decision was completed, the poor snake died with thirst.
