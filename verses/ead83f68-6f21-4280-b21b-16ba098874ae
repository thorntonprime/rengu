Title: A Dying Dog
---
A dog is dying on the road.
A man is weeping beside him. A beggar comes by.

Why the tears? This dog hunted game for me.
He kept watch at night.
Many times he drove away thieves.

What's wrong? Hunger has weakened him.
What's in the bag? Your food sack looks full.

Those are leftovers from last night.
I'll eat them later.
Give a little to the dog.

I give him these tears instead.
They are easier to come by.
Food on the road costs hard-earned money.

The beggar curses the man and leaves.
The beggar is right. The man's values are reversed.
Tears are worth more than money.
Tears are blood distilled into water.

Pay attention to those who want to change
so badly that they cry and dissolve
into lovingkindness and freedom.
