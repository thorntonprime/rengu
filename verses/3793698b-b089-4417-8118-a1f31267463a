Confucius said, "Life and death are great affairs, and yet they are no
change to him. Though heaven and earth flop over and fall down, it is
no loss to him. He sees clearly into what has no falsehood and does not
shift with things. He takes it as fate that things should change, and
he holds fast to the source."
