A sight of Happiness is Happiness. It transforms the Soul and makes it
Heavenly, it powerfully calls us to communion with God, and weans us
from the customs of this world. ... I no sooner discerned this but I
was (as Plato saith, In summ√¢ Rationis arce quies habitat) seated in a
throne of repose and perfect rest. ... Whereupon you will not believe,
how I was withdrawn from all endeavours of altering and mending
outward things.  They lay so well, methought, they could not be
mended; but I must be mended to enjoy them.
