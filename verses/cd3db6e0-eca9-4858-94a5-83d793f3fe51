The Brahman (Supreme Being) created Brahmâ, the creator seated on the lotus;
having been created, Brahmâ began to think, "By which single syllable may
I be able to enjoy all the desires, all the worlds, all the gods, all the
Vedas, all the sacrifices, all the sounds, all the rewards, all the beings,
stationary and moving." He practised self-control and saw OM, of two syllables,
of four morae, the all-pervading, omnipresent, the eternally potent Brahman,
the Brahman’s own symbolic syllable, of which the presiding divinity is
Brahman itself; with it, he enjoyed all the desires of all the worlds, all
gods, all Vedas, all sacrifices, all sounds, all rewards and all beings,
both stationary and moving.
