There is a sect of heretics called Sophists (Sûfistâ’iyân). who believe that
nothing can be known and that knowledge itself does not exist. I say to them：
‘You think that nothing can be known; is your opinion correct or not?’ If they
answer 'it is correct', they thereby affirm the reality of knowledge; and if
they reply 'it is not correct', then to argue against an avowedly incorrect
assertion is absurd.
