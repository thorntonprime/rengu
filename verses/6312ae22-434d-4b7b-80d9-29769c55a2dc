We have the two fundamental elementsï¼š the ecstatic and the rational
element united. There is ecstasy but the highest creation of the ecstasy
is love in the sense of agape. There is ecstasy but the other creation of
ecstasy is gnosis, the knowledge ofGod. It is knowledge, and it is not
disorder and chaos.
