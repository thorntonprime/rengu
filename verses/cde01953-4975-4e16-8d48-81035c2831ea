\"Lady Li was the daughter of the border guard of Ai. When she was
first taken captive and brought to the state of Chin, she wept until
her tears drenched the collar of her robe. But later, when she went to
live in the palace of the ruler, shared his couch with him, and ate the
delicious meats of his table, she wondered why she had ever wept. How
do I know that the dead do not wonder why they ever longed for life?
