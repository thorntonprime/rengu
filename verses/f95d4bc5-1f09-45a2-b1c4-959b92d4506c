Title: Ax
By: Suio Genro
Commentary: |
  Suio, one of the leading followers of Hakuin, was known for the charm of his
  paintings, but here he has depicted a jaggededged ax that fills much of the
  composition with its sturdy form. Above the ax comes the haiku inscription,
  Visually suggesting another ax-head in three flowing and descending columns,
  but the center of the scroll is left empty. Is it incomplete.
Format: verse

This ax of mine
does away with
peopleâ€˜s incompleteness.
