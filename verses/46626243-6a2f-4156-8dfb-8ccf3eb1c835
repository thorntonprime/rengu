And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him
was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he
had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called
The Word of God.
