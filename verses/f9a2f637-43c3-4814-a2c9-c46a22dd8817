Now God and heaven gone, the soul is finally cut off from every influx of
divinity, so his spirit is no longer given to her. Arrived at this the soul
belongs to the eternal life rather than creation; her uncreated spirit lives
rather than herself; the uncreated, eternally-existent which is no less than
God. ...

We ought to be eternally as poor as when we were not. ... St Dionysius says,
‘Be the soul never so bare the Godhead is barer’; a naught from which no shoot
was ever lopped nor ever shall be. ... The Godhead is as void as though it were
not.
