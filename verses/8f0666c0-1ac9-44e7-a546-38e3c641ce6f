If then the rational part of a man’s soul is illumined by a ray of
light from God, for that man the working of the. daemons is brought to
naught; for no daemon and no god has power against a single ray of the
light of God. But such men are few indeed; and all others are led and
driven, soul and body, by the daemons, setting their hearts and
affections on the workings of the daemons. This is that love which is
devoid of reason, that love which goes astray and leads men astray.
The daemons then govern all our earthly life, using our bodies as
their instruments; and this government Hermes called 'destiny’.
