  [The deer and the unicorn are] Soul and Spirit respectively, according to
  the alchemist, who calls the forest the Body.
---
The Sages say truly
That two animals are in this forestï¼š
One glorious, beautiful, and swift,
A great and strong deer;
The other an unicorn.
They are concealed in the forest.
But happy shall that man be called
Who shall snare and capture them.

 ...

He that knows how to tame and master them by Art,
To couple them together.
And to lead them in and out of the forest.
May justly be called a Master.
For we rightly judge
That he has attained the golden flesh.
And may triumph everywhere;
Nay, he may bear rule over great Augustus.
