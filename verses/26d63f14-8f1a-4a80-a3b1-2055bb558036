If thou standest resolutely here, and shrinkest not back, thou shalt
see or feel great wonders. For thou shalt find Christ in thee
assaulting hell, and crushing thy beasts in pieces, and that a great
tumult and misery will arise in thee： also thy secret undiscovered
sins will then first awake, and labour to separate thee from God. and
to keep thee back.  Thus shalt thou truely find and feel how death and
life fight one against the other, and shalt understand by what passeth
within thyself, what heaven and hell are. At all which be not moved,
but stand firm and shrink not： for at length all thy creatures will
grow faint, weak, and ready to die： and then thy will shall wax
stronger, and be able to subdue and keep down the evil inclinations.
So shall thy will and mind ascend into heaven every day. and thy
creatures gradually die away. Thou wilt get a mind wholly new. and
begin to be a new creature, and getting rid of the bestial deformity,
recover the divine image. Thus shalt thou be delivered from thy
present anguish, and return to thy original rest.
