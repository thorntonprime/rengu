  Evidently, the enlightened contemplative is not deceived regarding his
  true state, but the above citation is a way of affirming that the absolute
  Subject knows no objectification, or -- from a different perspective --
  that the absolute Object knows no subjectification.

The Lord Buddha ... inquired of Subhuti, saying： ‘What think you? May
an Arhat (having attained to absolute quiescence of mind) thus meditate
within himself, “I have obtained the condition of an Arhat”?’ Subhuti
replied, saying： ‘No! honoured of the worlds! And why? Because there is
not in reality a condition synonymous with the term Arhat. Honoured of the
worlds! If an Arhat thus meditates within himself, “I hâve obtained the
condition of an Arhat.” there would be obvious recurrence of such arbitrary
concepts as an entity, a being, a living being, and a personality.’
