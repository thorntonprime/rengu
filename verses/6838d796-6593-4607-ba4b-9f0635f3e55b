Such a man will leave the gold hidden in the mountains, the pearls
hidden in the depths. He will see no profit in money and goods, no
enticement in eminence and wealth, no joy in long life, no grief in
early death, no honor in affluence, no shame in poverty. He will not
snatch the profits of a whole generation and make them his private
hoard; he will not lord it over the world and think that he dwells in
glory. His glory is enlightenment, [for he knows that] the ten thousand
things belong to one storehouse, that life and death share the same
body.
