It is hard for us to forsake the familiar things around us, and turn
back to the old home whence we came. Things seen delight us, and
things unseen give rise to disbelief. Now the things that are evil are
more manifest to sight; but the Good cannot be seen by things
manifest; for it has no form or shape. It is impossible that an
incorporeal thing should be manifested to a thing that is corporeal;
because the incorporeal is like to itself, but unlike to all else.
