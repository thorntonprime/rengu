Title: Blessing the Marriage
---
This marriage be wine with halvah,
honey dissolving in milk.

This marriage be the leaves and fruit of a date tree.
This marriage be women laughing together for days on end.

This marriage, a sign for us to study.
This marriage, beauty.

This marriage, a moon in a light blue sky.
This marriage, this silence fully mixed with spirit.
