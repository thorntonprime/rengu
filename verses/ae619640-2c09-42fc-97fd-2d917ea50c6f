Title: The Return to Unity
---
Lightning, thunder and rain on and off all night. The lovely grey-green
valley; misty clouds sweeping low over the hills and forest out there in
the South, iron dark clouds heavy above them.

As I have been asked to write a piece on Paul the Hermit (died ca. 341)),
I reread his Vita by St. Jerome. A work of art, really, with plenty of
monastic theology in its symbolism. A beautiful piece of writing, with
deep mystical and psychological implications -- so that whether or not it
is “historical” is irrelevant. It awakens a kind of inner awareness
of psychic possibilities which one so easily forgets and neglects. The
return to unity, to the ground, the paradisial inner sacred space where
the archetypal man dwells in peace and in God. The journey to that space,
through a realm of aridity, dualism, dryness, death. The need of courage
and of desire. Above all faith, praise, obedience to the inner voice of
the Spirit, refusal to give up or to compromise.

What is " wrong" in my life is not so much a matter of “sin“ (though it
is sin, too), but a matter of unawareness, lostness, slackness, relaxation,
dissipation of desire, lack of courage and decision, so that I let myself
be carried along and dictated by an alien movement. The current of "
the world," which I know is not mine. I am always being diverted into
a way that is not my way and is not going where I am called to go. And
only if I go where I must go can I be of any use to “the world." I can
serve the world best by keeping my distance and my freedom.
