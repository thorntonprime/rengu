Title: How You Are with Me
Description: April 23
---
God spoke to Moses,
You are the one I have chosen,
and I love you.

Moses replies, I feel the generosity,
but say what it is in me
that causes your love.

God explains, You have seen a little child with its mother.
It does not know anyone else exists.

The mother praises or scolds,
a little slap perhaps,
but still the child reaches
to be held by her.

Disappointment, elation,
there is only one direction
that the child turns.

That is how
you are with me.
