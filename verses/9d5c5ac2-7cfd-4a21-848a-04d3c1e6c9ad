I am blind and do not see the things of this world; but when the light
comes from Above, it enlightens my Heart and I can see, for the Eye of my
Heart (Chante Ishta) sees everything; and through this vision I can help
my people. The heart is a sanctuary at the Center of which there is a little
space, wherein the Great Spirit ( Wakantanka) dwells, and this is the Eye. This
is the Eye of Wakantanka by which He sees all things, and through which we see
Him. If the heart is not pure. Wakantanka cannot be seen, and if you should
die in this ignorance, your soul shall not return immediately to Wakantanka,
but it must be purified by wandering about in the world. In order to know the
Centre of the Heart in which is the Mind of Wakantanka, you must be pure and
good, and live in the manner that Wakantanka has taught us. The man who is
thus pure contains the Universe within the Pocket of his Heart (Chante Ognaka).
