Commentary: |
  It is perhaps well to remind the reader here that where it is a
  question of rebirth into formal states of manifestation,
  transmigration but not reincarnation is involved, i.e. the states
  resemble those of our world by analogy but not identity, as a being
  can never pass through the same state twice.

0 son of Kunti, whatever state (or being) one dwells upon in the end,
at the time of leaving the body, that alone he attains, because of his
constant thought of that state or being. ...

If the embodied meets with death when Sattva is predominant, then he
attains the spotless regions of the knowers of the Highest. Meeting
with death in Rajas, one is born among those attached to action; and
dying in Tamas, one is born in the wombs of senseless beings.
