Lao Tan said, "The government of the enlightened king? His achievements
blanket the world but appear not to be his own doing. His transforming
influence touches the ten thousand things but the people do not depend
on him. With him there is no promotion or praise - he lets everything
find its own enjoyment. He takes his stand on what cannot be fathomed
and wanders where there is nothing at all."
