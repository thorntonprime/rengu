All things which have a soul change, and possess in themselves a
principle of change, and in changing move according to law and to the
order of destiny： natures which have undergone a lesser change move
less and on the earth’s surface, but those which have suffered more
change and have become more criminal sink into the abyss, that is to
say, into Hades and other places in the world below, of which the very
names terrify men. ...  When (the soul) has communion with divine
virtue and becomes divine, she is carried into another and better
place, which is perfect in holiness; but when she has communion with
evil, then she also changes the place of her life.
