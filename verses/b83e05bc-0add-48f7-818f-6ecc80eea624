Among men, be aloof

Do not engage yourself to any idea you get

Free yourself from everything chance brings to you,
things that accumulate and cumber you

Set your mind in virtue to contemplation,
in which the God you bear in your heart
shall be your steady object,
the object from which your attention never wavers

Whatever else your duty may be,
whether it be fasting, watching, or praying,
dedicate it all to this one end,
doing each only as much is necessary to your single end.

Thus you shall come to the goal of perfection.

Who could long endure this unwavering contemplation of the divine object?
No one living in such times as these.

I tell you about these things to have you know what the highest is,
so that you may desire it and aspire to it.
And if this vision is withdrawn from you,
if you are a good man,
the withdrawal shall be to you as if the eternity of bliss were taken away,
but you must return at once to the pursuit of it,
so that it may return to you.

Set a perpetual watch over yourself and your thoughts
and let your refuge be in this vision,
in which you abide as constantly as possible.
