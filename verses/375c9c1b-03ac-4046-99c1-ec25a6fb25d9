Commentary: It is noteworthy that Alchemy and Zen in common use a terminology
  which is the despair of rational logic, and which -- whatever needs for
  secrecy are incidentally served -- is aimed essentially at awakening the
  intellect through sudden 'vertical' intuitions. Moreover, the formulas and
  the koans once properly 'situated' prove not to be illogical.

If one objects that this (Taoist) method is exactly that of the Zen Buddhists,
we reply that under Heaven two Ways do not exist, and that the Sages are always
of the same Heart.
