The reason why ... we live starving in the coldness and deadness of a
formal, historical, hearsay-religion, is thisï¼š we are strangers to our
own inward misery and wants, we know not that we lie in the jaws of
death and hell; we keep all things quiet within us, partly by outward
forms and modes of religion and morality, and partly by the comforts,
cares and delights of this world. Hence it is that we consent to
receive a Saviour ... not because we feel an absolute want of one, but
because we have been told there is one, and that it would be a
rebellion against God to reject Him.
