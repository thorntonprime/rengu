How little
is my good.
Worry worn,
an urchin
in the chest.

In my foot
my mother
cries, and
swells. A
rare form
that grows
inward and
not outward.

How little
is my bone.
On a table
in the yard
and rain in
the cold air.

In my body
my mother
closes her
mouth, and
does not
touch me.
An animal,
small and soft,
walks in
between.

How little
is my thought.
Golden and
sunken.
