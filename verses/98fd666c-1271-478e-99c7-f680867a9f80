There is an Art by Fire to make Glass of Ashes. The Holy Ghost is that Fire,
which first reduceth this Creation, as into Ashes; then out of these Ashes
raiseth a new Heaven and Earth; The same in a new Form of Gold for Glory,
pouring forth Divine Beams; of Crystal for transparency, taking in the Divine
Light. Then shall the glorifyâ€™d Person of him. who is the righteousness of God;
then shall the Person of the Spirit, with all his Riches and Beauties, dwell
unveil'd in this Natural Image thus Spiritualiz'd; as the Sun-Beams dwell in
every Part and Point of clear Crystal.
