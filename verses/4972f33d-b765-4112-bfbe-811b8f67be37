Commentary: The two souls would corrspond with Âtmâ and jtvâtmâ.

The living all find death unpleasant, men mourn over it. And yet, what
is death, but the unbending of the bow and its return to its case;
what is it, but the emptying of the corporeal envelope and the
liberation of the two souls imprisoned therein?  After the
encumbrances and vicissitudes of life the two souls leave; the body
follows them into repose. This is the Great Return. -- That the
incorporeal has produced the corporeal, and that the body returns to
incorporeity, this idea of the Eternal Round is known to many people,
but only the elect draw the practical consequences from it.
