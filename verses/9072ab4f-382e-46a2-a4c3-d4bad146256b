Commentary: |
  In the first stanza we see the followers of the Way in ancient times or
  illo tempore, remote and inaccessible; but the second stanza brings them
  close and alive in a series of marvelous similes. (I am particularly fond
  of the polite and quiet houseguests.) The images of the valley and of uncut
  or uncarved wood will recur again and again.

Once upon a time
people who knew the Way
were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating,
unfathomable.

Since they’re inexplicable
I can only say what they seemed like：
Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river.
Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors.
Polite and quiet, like houseguests.
Elusive, like melting ice.
Blank, like uncut wood.
Empty, like valleys.
Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water.

Who can by stillness, little by little
make what is troubled grow clear?
Who can by movement, little by little
make what is still grow quick?

To follow the Way
is not to need fulfillment.
Unfulfilled, one may live on
needing no renewal.
