Title: The Attributes of Fine Spice
---
What soup could resist being affected by the attributes of fine spice,

especially if it were added by the hand of an excellent cook?

If you memorize some of my words they will release some of their
qualities into your ways. Friends might say hmmm ... you taste better,
what happened?

I am not talking about any kind of voodoo. It is just a fact.

What body would not want to surrender its tension to a skilled hand,
or a pir's words that can equal any touch?
