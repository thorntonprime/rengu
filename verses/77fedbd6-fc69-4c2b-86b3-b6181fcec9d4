As milk is spontaneously changed into curds and water into ice, so Brahma
modifies Itself in diverse ways, without the aid of instruments or external
means of any kind whatever. Thus the spider spins its web out of its own
substance, subtle beings take diverse forms, and the lotus grows from marsh
to marsh without organs of locomotion.
