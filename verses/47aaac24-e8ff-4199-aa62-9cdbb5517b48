Know that the discipline of outward acts, though it subdue nature,
cannot kill it. Nature dies by ghostly acts. There are many to be
found who, with the best intentions, cling on to themselves, not
denying themselves. Verily I say, these persons are mistaken, for it
is contrary to human reason, contrary to the habit of grace and
against the nature of the Holy Ghost. As for those who see their
salvation in outward practices, I do not say they will be lost, but
they will get to God only through hot cleansing fires; for they follow
not God who quit not themselves; keeping hold of themselves they
follow their own darkness.  God is no more to be found in any bodily
exercise than in sin.
