Title: On Security
---
Outside of poetry and art, security is only and ever achieved at the cost of
the most inescapable limitation. This diminishment consists of choosing to
be satisfied and pleasured by a world where everything is known and where
preoccupation with self is both possible and useful. But how could we want
that? Our security must become a relationship to the whole, omitting nothing.
