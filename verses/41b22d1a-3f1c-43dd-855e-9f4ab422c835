Allâh! There is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal. Neither sleep
overtaketh Him, nor slumber. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens
and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His
leave? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them,
while they encompass nothing of His Knowledge save what He will. His Throne
includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them.
He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.
