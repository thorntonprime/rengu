This earthly existence of ours is more brittle than the glass bangles
that ladies wear. You can keep glass bangles for thousands of years if
you treasure them in a chest and let them remain untouched. But this
earthly existence is so fickle that it may be wiped out in the twinkling
of an eye. Therefore while we get breathing time, let us get rid of the
distinctions of high and low, purify our hearts and be ready to face our
maker when an earthquake or some natural calamity or death in the ordinary
course takes us.
