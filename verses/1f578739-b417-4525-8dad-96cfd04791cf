Title: Easter's Clean Taste
---
The grace of Easter is a great silence, an immense tranquility and a
clean taste in your soul. It is the taste of heaven, but not the heaven
of some wild exaltation.The Easter vision is not riot and drunkenness of
spirit, but a discovery of order above all order -- a discovery of God
and of all things in Him.This is a wine without intoxication, a joy that
has no poison in it. It is life without death. Tasting it for a moment,
we are briefly able to see and love all things according to their truth,
to possess them in their substance hidden in God, beyond all sense. For
desire clings to the vesture and accident of things, but charity possesses
them in the simple depths of God.

If Mass could only be, every morning, what it is on Easter morning! If the
prayers could always be so clear, if the Risen Christ would always shine,
in my heart and all around me and before me in His Easter simplicity! For
His simplicity is our feast. This is the unleavened bread which is
manna and the bread of heaven, this Easter cleanness, this freedom, this
sincerity. Give us always this bread of heaven. Slake us always with this
water that we might not thirst forever!

This is the life that pours down into us from the Risen Christ, this is the
breath of his Spirit, and this is the love that quickens His Mystical Body.
