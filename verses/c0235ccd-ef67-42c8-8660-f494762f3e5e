Title: Don't Doubt
---
Don’t doubt. Don’t doubt even a little, though I’m far from you.
I don’t mind if you do, but it only adds to your pain.

When I first held you, I shed my clothes of deceit
and presented myself naked as when I first entered the world.
Even now I offer myself as that first time.

If this seems unnatural, it is only because I want to
give you my guileless self forever.
If it’s your will, I’ll shed even the clothes of life.

If I have a fault, it’s the “sorrow” of longing for you.
Because when you left, you pressed my lips over and over,
saying, “Don’t be sad.”

So forgive me this.
Sorrow for you is my very life.
If you don’t forgive me, I’ll take a shower of punishment
like falling petals in the spring morning rain.
I won’t refuse the lash of your love.
I’ll accept the bind of love’s harsh law.

If you doubt me, then your error of doubt
and my fault of sorrow will cancel each other.
Don’t doubt, though I’m far from you.
Don’t add to your pain.
