Maria Alvarez Davila y Salazar was one of the nieces of Madre Teresa; as
noble as one could be; as beautiful as one could wish. One September day, she
invited her friends to accompany her on an outing： the women in litter, the
gentlemen on horseback. ...

She has them take the direction of the Convent of Saint-Joseph, she descends,
the gate to the enclosure opens, Teresa of Jesus who was awaiting her appears
carrying a crucifix. Maria, kneeling, kisses ardently the feet of Jesus,
then without turning back to answer the farewells, she lets the Madre close
the door behind her and forthwith divests herself of her finery.

Thus did Maria Davila cause among all the nobility and knights of the city a
great astonishment.
