Title: Behold Your Self
---
Like a great film or play everyone should see, BEHOLD THYSELF.
Hints of your beauty the mountains have. The enchanting complexions of the
 coral reefs are pale to a golden candle in our heart.
What moves in any ocean moves through us. A thousand kinds of music play
 every hour that you orchestrate.
Let the next ticket you buy help seat you in front of ... your soul
