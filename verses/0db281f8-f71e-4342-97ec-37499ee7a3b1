  - Discernment-Truth=The Void=The Shattering of Forms
By: Shen-hui

\‘What is the Void?’ asked the Master of the Law Ch’ung-yüan. ‘If you tell me
that it exists, then you are surely implying that it is solid and resistant. If
on the other hand you say it is something that does not exist, in that case why
go to it for help?’ ‘One talks of the Void.’ replied Shen-hui, ‘for the benefit
of those who have not seen their own Buddhanatures. For those who have seen
their Buddha-natures the Void does not exist. It is this view about the Void
that I call “going to it for help".’
