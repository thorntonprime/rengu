Title: My Path
---
So many paths in this world --
in the mountain, paths of stone;
in the ocean, waterways;
in the sky, paths of moon and stars.

Along the river, the fisherman makes footprints in the sand.
In the field, the girl picking greens tramples sweet grass.
The evil one travels the way of wrongdoing.
The righteous one walks the blade’s edge.
The setting sun treads the reddening sky.
Morning’s pure dew glides down flower buds.

As for me, I have two possible paths in this world：
one is the path of your embrace;
the other is death’s.
Other paths are worse than dying.

Who lays down my path?
In this world, only you can.
If you have laid down my path
why that of death as well?
