You are the soul, the universe,
and what animates the universe.

I live and work inside you.
I speak with what was found in the ruins of a former self.

Concealed in your garden, I have become a ladder,
propped against and leading up into the sky-dome.

Why cry for what is closer than voice?
I ask to hear the wisdom that uncovers the soul.

These four come with their answers.

Fire： You have a saucepan to cook what is raw.
Wear it like a saddle on your back.

Water： You have a spring inside.
Soak the earth.

Jupiter in its good luck aspect： Show your talent.
Do something outside time and space.

Jupiter in its bad mood： Be consumed with jealousy.
What else is there?

Prophets come and go for one reason,
to say：

Human beings, you have great value inside your form, a seed.
Be led by the rose inside the rose.

Doubt is part of existence.
There is no proof of the soul.

To I ask in this talking with soul, this prayer, this kindness：

When the soul leaves my body, where will these poems be?

Answer： It was like that in the beginning, before you were born,
so what are you worrying about?

Love, finish this verse, please.
You know which words will last.

Friend, say the meaning of the names,
the inward sky that you are.
