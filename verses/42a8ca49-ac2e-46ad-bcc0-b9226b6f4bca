Title: The Sole Heir to the King
---
Perhaps for one minute out of the day it may be of value to torture yourself
 with thoughts like,
"I should be doing a hell of a lot more with my life than I am ... 'cause
 I'm so damn talented."
But remember for just one minute out of the day.
With all the rest of your time it would be best to try looking upon yourself
 more as God does.
For God knows your true royal nature. God is never confused and can only
 see Himself in you.
My dear, Venus just leaned down and asked me to tell you a secret, to confess
she is just a mirror that has been stealing your light and music for centuries.
She knows, as does Hafiz, you are the sole heir to the King.
