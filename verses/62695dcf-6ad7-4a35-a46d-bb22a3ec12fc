  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=Music
By: Confucius

The music of Cheng is lewd and corrupting, the music of Sung is soft and makes
one effeminate, the music of Wei is repetitious and annoying, and the music of
Ch'i is harsh and makes one haughty. These four kinds of music are all sensual
music and undermine the people's character, and that is why they cannot be used
at the sacrifices. The Book of Songs says. 'The harmonious sounds are shu and
vung and my ancestor listened to them.' Shu means ‘pious’ and yung means
‘peaceful’. If you have piety and peacefulness of character, you can do
everything you want with a country.
