Eternal Wisdomï¼š According to the natural order, we take the highest
emanation of all beings from their first origin through the noblest
beings down to the lowest. But the return to the origin takes place
through the lowest to the highest. Therefore, if thou wouldst see Me
in My uncreated Divinity, thou shoudst learn to know Me in My
suffering humanity, for that is the swiftest way to eternal bliss.
