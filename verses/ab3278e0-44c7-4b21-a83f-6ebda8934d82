Brahmacharya is â€˜living in Brahman'. It has no connection with celibacy as
commonly understood. ... Celibacy is certainly an aid to realisation among so
many other aids.. .. It is a matter of fitness of mind. Married or unmarried, a
man can realise the Self, because that is here and now. If it were not so. but
attainable by some efforts at some other time, and if it were new and something
to be acquired, it would not be worthy of pursuit. Because what is not natural
cannot be permanent either. But what I say is that the Self is here and now and
alone.
