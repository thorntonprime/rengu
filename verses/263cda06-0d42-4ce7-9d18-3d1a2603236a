Title: Ramadan Silence
Description: July 12
---
When the Ramadan banner flies,
soul restrains nature, so it can taste its own food.

The strength of horses and the intensity of fire,
these are the powers of sacrifice.

Fasting, we honor the guest. Clouds of courage
give rain, because it was in this month
that the Qur'an rained down,
light through an opening.

Grab the rope, and be lifted out
of the body's pit.

Announce to Egypt that Joseph of Canaan
has come. Jesus dismounts the donkey,
and the sacrament table descends.

Wash your hands. Wash your face.
Do not eat or speak as you normally do.
Other food and other words will come in the silence.
