“What do you do all day?” he said.

“Teach music; I have another interest too.”

"Work!" said old Jolyon, picking up the doll from off the swing, and
smoothing its black petticoat. “Nothing like it, is there? I don’t
do any now. I’m getting on. What interest is that?”

“Trying to help women who’ve come to grief.” Old Jolyon did not
quite understand. “To grief?” he repeated; then realized with a shock
that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that
expression. Assisting the Madgalenes of London! What a weird and terrifying
interest! And, curiously overcoming his natural shrinking, he asked：

“Why? What do you do for them?"

"Not much. I’ve no money to spare. I can only give sympathy and food
sometimes.”

Involuntarily old Jolyon’s hand sought his purse. He said hastily：
“How d’you get hold of them?”

"I go to a hospital.”

“A hospital! Phew!”

“What hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of
beauty.”
