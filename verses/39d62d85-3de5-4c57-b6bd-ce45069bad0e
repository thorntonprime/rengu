---
Who keeps his own mind to follow
with mind enough among his fellows?

Respect the good.
Respect the evil, too.
Such is respect.
Trust the faithful.
Trust the untrue, as well.
Such is trust.

A wise man disappears himself,
and appears to all confounded and wild.
With every eye and ear upon him,
he exudes the innocence of a child.
