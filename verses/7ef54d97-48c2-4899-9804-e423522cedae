Title: The Secret of Embroidery
---
I finished sewing all your clothes.
I sewed your scholar’s coat, your suit, your pajamas --
 all but the embroidery on a small satchel.

That satchel is stained by my fingers --
 because I worked it, then worked it again.
Others suppose that I have little talent for needlework, but only I know
 this secret：
when my heart aches I embroider.
My heart follows the golden thread through the eye of the needle
 and from the embroidery comes a pure song that becomes my heart.
And still there are no valuables in the world worth carrying
 in this little satchel.

I haven’t finished the satchel- --
not because I can’t, but because I like to embroider.
