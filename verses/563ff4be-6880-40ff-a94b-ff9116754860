Commentary: Citing Kablaya, a holy man, on the Sun Dance
---
You should prepare a necklace of otter skin, and from it there should hang a
circle with a cross in the center. At the four places where the cross meets the
circle there should hang eagle feathers which represent the four Powers of the
universe and the four ages. At the center of the circle you should tie a plume
taken from the breast of the eagle, for this is the place which is nearest to
the heart and center of the sacred bird. This plume will be for Wakan-Tanka,
who dwells at the depths of the heavens, and who is the center of all things.
