The Self is self-effulgent. One need give it no mental picture, any way. The
thought that imagines is itself bondage, because the Self is the Effulgence
transcending darkness and light; one should not think of it with the mind. Such
imagination will end in bondage, whereas the Self is spontaneously shining as
the Absolute. This enquiry into the Self in the form of devotional meditation,
evolves into the state of absorption of the mind into the Self and leads to
Liberation.
