Devotee： My work demands the best part of my time and energy; often I
am too tired to devote myself to Atma-chintana.

Maharshi： The feeling ‘I work’ is the hindrance. Enquire, ‘Who
works?’ Remember, ‘Who am I?’ The work will not bind you. It will go
on automatically.  Make no effort either to work or to renounce work.
Your effort is the bondage. What is bound to happen will happen.

If you are destined to cease working, work cannot be had even if you
hunt for it. If you are destined to work you cannot leave it; you will
be forced to engage in it. So leave it to the Higher Power. You cannot
renounce or hold as you choose
