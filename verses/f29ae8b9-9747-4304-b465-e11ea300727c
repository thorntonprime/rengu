Musical harmony is a most powerful conceiver. It allures the celestial
influences and changes affections, intentions, gestures, notions, actions, and
dispositions. ... Fish in the lake of Alexandria are delighted with harmonious
sounds; music has caused friendship between dolphins and men. The playing of
the harp affects the Hyperborean swans.  Melodious voices tame the Indian
elephants. The elements themselves delight in music.
