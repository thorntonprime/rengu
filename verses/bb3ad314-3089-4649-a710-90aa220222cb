This state is not to be got by effort, but through the dawn of knowledge,
in a mysterious way. We may call it divine grace, or it may be as a result of
the efforts done in a previous life. Whatever that be, when knowledge comes,
we are lost in the radiance of the supreme Reality, which is universal,
infinite and eternal, and thereafter we live in that state perennially.
