Know, may Allâh the Exalted have mercy on thee, that the Elixir of Redness
is not directly formed, but must first pass through the stage of the Elixir
of Whiteness (i.e, of silver). ... After it has become dry ... it becomes
fixed in the colour of purple, and is waxy, fusible, soluble, stable. One
part of it is capable of transforming into gold a thousand parts of mercury
which has been fixed by means of the Elixir of Silver. Similarly if you wish
to project it upon silver it will turn it into pure gold, more precious than
the gold of mines.
