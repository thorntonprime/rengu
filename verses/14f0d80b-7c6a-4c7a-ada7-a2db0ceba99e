Title: The New Man
---
The old and the new.

For the "old man.“ everything is old： he has seen everything or
thinks he has. He has lost hope in anything new.What pleases him is the
“old” he clings to, tearing to lose it, but he is certainly not happy
with it. And so he keeps hinrseltmold" and cannot change： he is not
open to any newness. His life is stagnant and futile. And yet there may
be much movement -- but change that leads to no change. Plus ca change,
plus c'est la meme chosen.

For the "new man" everything is new. Even the old is transfigured in
the Holy Spirit and is always new. There is nothing to cling to, there
is nothing to be hoped for in what is already past -- it is nothing. The
new man is he who can find reality where it cannot be seen by the eyes
of the flesh -- where it is not yet -- where it comes into being the
moment he sees it. And would not be (at least to‘r him) if he did not
see it. The new man lives in a world that is always being created, and
renewed. He lives in this realm of renewal and creation. He lives in life.

The old man lives Without life. He lives in death, and clings to what has
died precisely because he clings to it. And yet he is crazy for change,
as if struggling with the bonds of death. His struggle is miserable,
and cannot be a substitute for life“.

Thought of these things atter Communion today, when I suddenly realized
that I had, and for how long, deeply lost hope of "anything new." How
foolish, when in fact the newness is there all the time.
