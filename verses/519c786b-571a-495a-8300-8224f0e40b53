Title: Not Prisoners
---
If we imagine our being as a room of any size, it seems that most of
us know only a single corner of that room, a spot by the window, a
narrow strip on which we keep walking back and forth. That gives a
kind of security. But isn't insecurity with all its dangers so much
more human?

We are not prisoners of that room.
