Now the possessor of a state possesses a great thing. Because he
possesses a great thing, he cannot be regarded as a mere thing himself.
 He is a thing, and yet he is not a mere thing; therefore he can
treat other things as mere things. He who clearly- understands that, in
treating other things as mere things, he himself is no longer a mere
thing-how could he be content only to govern the hundred clans of the
world and do nothing more? He will move in and out of the Six Realms,
wander over the Nine Continents, going alone, coming alone. He may be
called a Sole Possessor, and a man who is a Sole Possessor may be said
to have reached the peak of eminence.
