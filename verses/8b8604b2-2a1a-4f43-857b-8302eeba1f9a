The golden rule, is resolutely to refuse to have what millions cannot. This
ability to refuse will not descend upon us all of a sudden. The first
thing is to cultivate the mental,attitude that will not have possession or
facilities denied to millions, and the next immediate thing is to rearrange
our lives as fast as possible in accordance with that mentality.
