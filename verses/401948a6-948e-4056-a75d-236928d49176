Let me assure you that in our whole work there is nothing hidden but
the regimen, of which it was truly said by the Sage that whoever knows
it perfectly will be honoured by princes and potentates. I tell you
plainly that if this one point were clearly set forth, our Art would
become mere women’s work and child’s play： there would be nothing in
it but a simple process of ‘cooking’. Hence it has always been most
carefully concealed by the Sages. But I have determined to write in a
more sympathetic and kindly spirit： know then that our regimen
throughout consists in coction and digestion, but that it implies a
good many other processes, which those jealous Sages have made to
appear different by describing them under different names.
