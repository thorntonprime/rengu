This was the True Man of oldï¼š his bearing was lofty and did not
crumble; he appeared to lack but accepted nothing; he was dignified in
his correctness but not insistent; he was vast in his emptiness but not
ostentatious. Mild and cheerful, he seemed to be happy; reluctant, he
could not help doing certain things; annoyed, he let it show in his
face; relaxed, he rested in his virtue. Tolerant, he seemed to be part
of the world; towering alone, he could be checked by nothing;
withdrawn, he seemed to prefer to cut himself off; bemused, he forgot
what he was going to say.
