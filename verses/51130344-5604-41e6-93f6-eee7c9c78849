  - Body: It may he observed here that wherever it is asserted that a given
      event, such as the temporal birth of Christ, is at once unique and
      historically true we recognize an antinomy; because, as Aristotle
      perceived "knowledge () is of that which is always or usually so, not
      of exceptions." whence it follows that the birth in Bethlehem can only
      be thought of as historical if it is granted, that there have
      also been other such "descents".

0 Bhârata, whenever there is decline of virtue and predominance of vice, then I
embody Myself.

For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil-doers and for
the re-establishment of Dharma am born from age to age.
