The Way is always inaction,
But nothing is left undone.
If the rulers could realise it
The people would be themselves transformed.
If, being transformed, they show desire
I restrain it by means of the un-carved block.
The nameless un-carved block
Is freedom from desire.
Without desire they are calm,
And the realm is of itself at peace.
