There is a brighter ether than this blue
  Pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,
  A deeper greenness than this laughing assault
Of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.
Immortal spaces of cerulean hue
  Are in our reach and fields without this fault
  Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
In their deep murmur which white flowers strew

Floating like stars upon a strip of sky.
  This world behind is made of truer stuff
    Than the manufactured tissue of earth’s grace.
There we can walk and see the gods go by
  And sip from Hebe’s cup nectar enough
    To make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face.
