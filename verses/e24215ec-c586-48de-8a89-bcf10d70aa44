Title: Cupping My Hands Like a Mountain Valley
Description: September 27
---
Like the way the valleys of the earth cup their hands for light and drink;
like the way the desert opens up its sweet mouth and laughs when
someone melts pearls in the sky, and rain, rain returns like a divine
 lover with
a hundred wonderful gifts; O the words of the true teacher now bring to my
 mind and soul such a sacred nourishment and life.
Like the way the valleys of the earth cup their hands for light and drink;
like the way the desert opens up its sweet mouth and laughs when someone
 melts pearls in the sky and rain, rain, rain returns like a divine lover;
hey, I think there is a song here? Go for it!
