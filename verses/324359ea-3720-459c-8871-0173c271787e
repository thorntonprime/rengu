A monk asked Daishu Ekai (Ta-chu Hui-hai), one of the T’ang masters, when Zen
was in its heyday：

‘What is great nirvana?'

The master answered, ‘Not to commit oneself to the karma of birth-and-death
is great nirvana'

‘What, then, is the karma of birth-and-death?’

‘To desire great nirvâna is the karma of birth-and-death.’
