Title: Sour, Doughy, Raw and Numb
Description: August 3
---
If we are not together in the heart,
what's the point?

When body and soul are not dancing,
there is no pleasure in colorful clothing.

Why have cooking pans
if there is no food in the house?

In this world full of fresh bread,
amber, and musk, what are they
to someone with no sense of smell?

If you stay away from fire,
you will remain sour,
doughy, raw, and numb.

You may have lovely just-baked loaves
around you, but those friends cannot help.
You have to feel the oven fire yourself.
