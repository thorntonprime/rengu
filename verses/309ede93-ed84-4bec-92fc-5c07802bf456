A life devoted to the interests and enjoyments of this world, spent and
wasted in the slavery of earthly desires, may be truly called a dream, as
having all the shortness, vanity, and delusion of a dream; only with this
great difference, that when a dream is over nothing is lost but fictions and
fancies; but when the dream of life is ended only by death, all that eternity
is lost, for which we were brought into being.
