Great Tao overflows. To the left To the right.
All beings owe their life to it And do not depart from it. It acts without
 a name. It clothes and nourishes all beings But does not become their
 master.
Enduring without desires, It may be called slight.
All beings return to it, But it does not become their master. It may be
 called immense.
By not making itself great, It can do great things.
