Title: My Farewell
Description: September 26
---
Some new texture of consciousness has risen where I camped.
A fire that I sat around and thought of you, you turned into a place of
 pilgrimage that God visits.
Not bowing to anyone but yourself, is where this world is rightfully heading.
The Beloved is making me the center of His own being. How can one accept
 such an office?
Take your greatest moment of pleasure and multiply that by a millionfold,
 then you might barely conceive of what I am talking about.
Has your life been so conservative and restrained that you never collapsed
 onto the floor from ecstasy?
Who can remain standing in this divine process of turning into God? All
 forms collapse into a golden dust.
Nothing of me may survive to speak. These poems are my farewell. A silence
 between us
would be my preference, but then my awkward kiss, my words, might not be known.
