I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
worshiping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth --
pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit
of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship? -- to do the will of God --
that is worship. And what is the will of God? -- to do to my fellow man
what I would have my fellow man do to me -- that is the will of God. Now,
Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do
to me? Why, unite with me in my particular form of worship. Consequently,
I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator.
