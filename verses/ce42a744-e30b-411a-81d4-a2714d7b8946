Title: He Yawned Thirty-Three and One-Half Times
Description: October 16
---
I sat with him for an hour, a man who kept insisting I come to his house.
I brought one of my students with me, someone who I know gets easily bored
 if the conversation or thought content ... ebbs.
This man had in mind to try and impress me with a thesis he wrote.
I listened as if I never heard anything as great in my whole life,
which was then confusing to our host, as my student yawned 33 and 1/2 times
 and then fell asleep, expelled foul gas and snored loudly.
All is a kind of learning curve, and perhaps that man and his pen are still
 assessing that nightâ€™s events.
