Title: Every Angel
---
A theologian once taught that the angels around us
here on earth are unhappy compared with those that
surround God in heaven. Nonsense!

Every angel does the will of the One who sent it and
God's work is good equally and everywhere.

Were the Holy One to have an angel in the trees for
picking off caterpillars, that would be the greatest joy
imaginable.
