  Note Dante's ‘abandon all hope, ye that enter', for the inverse analogy,
  that of those condemned to damnation.

The saint hath no fear, because fear is the expectation either of some
future calamity or of the eventual loss of some object of desire, whereas the
saint is the son of his time (ibn waqtihi); he has no future that he should
fear anything; and as he hath no fear so he hath no hope, since hope is the
expectation either of gaining an object of desire or of being relieved from
a misfortune, and this belongs to the future; nor does he grieve, because
grief arises from the rigour of time, and how should he feel grief who is
in the radiance of satisfaction (ridâ) and the garden of concord (muwâfaqat)?
