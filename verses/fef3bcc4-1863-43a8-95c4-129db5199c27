With some people God will transform their disobedience into obedience,
so that their actions will not be counted as transgressions before
God. With others, their apparent disobedience is in itself obedience,
since it is in conformity with the Divine Will, although the Divine
Commandment contradicts what the Divine Will demands of them.
