    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Train Yourself to This
---
You carry within you the capacity to imagine and give shape to your world. It
is a pure and blessed way of living. Train yourself to this, but also trust
whatever comes. If it comes from your desire, from some inner need, accept
that and hate nothing.
