Title: Two Solitudes Protecting Each Other
---
The experience of loving, that now disappoints so many, can actually change and
be transformed from the ground up into the building of a relationship between
two human beings, not just a man and a woman. And this more authentic love will
be evident in the utterly considerate, gentle, and clear manner of its binding
and releasing. It will resemble what we now struggle to prepareï¼š the love
that consists of two solitudes which border, protect, and greet each other.
