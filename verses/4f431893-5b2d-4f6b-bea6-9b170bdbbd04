Title: Changsha Hiking on the Mountain
---
Changsha one day returned from hiking on the mountain
and came to the Leader at the gate.

The Leader-Seat asked, "Venerable, what places have you
been going to and coming from?"

Sha said, "I'm coming from hiking on the mountain."

The Leader-Seat said, "You arrived, where did you come
from?"

Sha said, "In the beginning I left following the
fragrant grasses; and then I returned chasing the falling blossoms."

The Seat said, "That is very much like the meaning of
Spring."

Sha said, "It even excels the Autumn dew drops on the
lotus."

Xuedou's attached words said, "Thank you for the words
of reply."

The great earth is broken into fine dust.

Whose eyes are not opened?

"In the beginning I left following the fragrant grasses;

and then I returned chasing the falling blossoms."

A feeble crane raises up a cold tree.

A wild ape howls in an ancient tower.

The infinite meaning of Changsha.

Bah!
