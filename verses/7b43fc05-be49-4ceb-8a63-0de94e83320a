Title: A Life of Clashes and Discoveries
---
I begin my jubilee year not exactly clear what I am doing, for everything
is always beginning again. If everything in my life remains indefinite
to some extent (though it is superficially definite), I accept this as a
good thing. As a serious and perhaps troubling thing, always faced with
possibilities, I must recognize that many of the “possibilities” are
so illusory or so impossible as not to be worth considering. And at times
I will not know which to consider, which not.

Coming to grips with my reality -- (as if this were not going on all the time)
coordinating, incorporating in a living regime all that I can reach to make
relevant my presence here, on its way to ending. The religious depth of
Ammonias, the perspicacity of Merleau-Ponty, even the tedious subtleties
of Sartre, and always the Bible. Meetings of opposites, not carefully
planned exclusions and mere inclusion of the familiar.A life of clashes
and discoveries, not of repetitions： and yet also deep dread before God,
and not trivial excitement.
