Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher

Confucius said, "Fish thrive in water, man thrives in the Way. For
those that thrive in water, dig a pond and they will find nourishment
enough. For those that thrive in the Way, don't bother about them and
their lives will be secure. So it is said, the fish forget each other
in the rivers and lakes, and men forget each other in the arts of the
Way."
