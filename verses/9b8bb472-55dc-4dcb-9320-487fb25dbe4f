Crippled become whole, Crooked becomes straight, Hollow becomes full, Worn
 becomes new, Little becomes more, Much becomes delusion.
Therefore the Sages cling to the One And take care of this world;
Do not display themselves And therefore shine. Do not assert themselves and
 therefore stand out. Do not praise themselves And therefore succeed.
Do not contend And therefore no one under heaven Can contend with them.
The old saying Crippled becomes whole Is not empty words. It becomes whole
 and returns.
