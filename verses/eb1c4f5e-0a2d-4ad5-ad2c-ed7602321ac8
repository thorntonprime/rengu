Sansheng asked Xuefeng, "[If] the golden fish scales
that pass through the net are not investigated, [then] what is used for
food?"

Feng said, "Wait until you come out of the net, then
[I'll] speak to you."

Sheng said, "A Learned and Virtuous One of fifteen
hundred people and [you] still don't know the 'head of the word'
(huatou). "

Feng said, "[I'm] an old monk in residence managing
numerous affairs."
