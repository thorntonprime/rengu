The prophets meditate within their own hearts,
and watch their thoughts change in substance.
This process is subjective, but God's light illumines their thoughts.
This light emanates from outside the subjective mind.
But it does not result in words that can be understood.
It is simply light.
From this point on, one may transcend to higher and higher realms of
light until the mind of one who meditates reaches its divine destination.
