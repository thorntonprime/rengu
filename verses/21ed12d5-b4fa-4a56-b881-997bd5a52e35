The Absolute Beauty is the Divine Majesty endued with (the attributes of) power
and bounty. Every beauty and perfection manifested in the theatre of the
various grades of beings is a ray of His perfect beauty reflected therein. It
is from these rays that exalted souls have received their impress of beauty and
their quality of perfection.
