  Title: Meister Eckhart
---
When you get rid of selfishness,
together with things and what pertains to them,
and have transferred all to God,
and united with him,
and abandoned all for him in complete trust and love,
then whatever your lot,
whatever touches you,
for better or worse, sour or sweet,
none of it is yours but it is all God's.
