Title: How Can I Possess You?
---
Do not be content with the God
you think about, for when this

thinking comes to an end you lose
the one you thought about as God.

Trust that you already have God
in your heart, for God is always

already there, and in that trust
you will find God shining out

to you in everything in your life.
