Be free of learnedness, renounce what's told,
and all will benefit a hundredfold.
Be free of "charity," renounce what's "right,"
and natural affections will reignite.
Be free of shrewdness, renounce what's dear,
and thieves and bandits will disappear.

These three alone will not suffice,
thus honor these as wellï¼š

Be simple, like an undyed cloth,
authentic, like an unhewn block.
Be free of self.
Be free of want.
Be free of all that's taught as true,
and thus be free of troubles, too.
