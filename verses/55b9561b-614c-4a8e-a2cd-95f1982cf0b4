Commentary: The faithless have been defined as those who doubt all
  their former beliefs and believe all their former doubts.

Be attached, like the door-ring, to that same door; keep watch and be
nimble and ready to spring.

Do not be the type of our breaking faith, do not recklessly make
disloyalty notorious.

Since fidelity is the badge by which the dogs are known, begone and do
not bring opprobrium and ill-fame upon the dogs.
