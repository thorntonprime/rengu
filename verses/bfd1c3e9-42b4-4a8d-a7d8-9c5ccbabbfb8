By: John Smith the Platonist
Commentary: In answer to Epicurus. The argument in this paragraph, which is
  derived from Plotinus (Enneads, iv. vii. S). rejects evolutionism while
  anticipating it.

As by its xpovixol npooSoi (as the Platonists are wont to speak) ‘chronical and
successive operations’, (the soul) unravels and unfolds the contexture of its
own indefinite intellectual powers by degrees; so by this memory and prevision
it recollects and twists them all up together again into itself. And though it
seems to be continually sliding from itself in those several vicissitudes and
changes which it runs through in the constant variety of its own effluxes and
emanations; yet is it always returning back again to its first original, by a
swift remembrance of all those motions and multiplicity of operations which
have begot in it the first sense of this constant efflux. As if we should see a
sunbeam perpetually flowing forth from the bright body of the sun, and yet ever
returning back to it again; it never loseth any part of its being, because it
never forgets what itself was; and though it may number out never so vast a
length of its duration, yet it never comes nearer to its old age, but carrieth
a lively sense of its youth and infancy along with it, which it can at pleasure
lay a fast hold on.

But if our souls were nothing else but a complex of fluid atoms, we should be
continually roving and sliding from ourselves, and soon forget what we once
were. The new matter that would come in to fill up that vacuity which the old
had made by its departure, would never know what the old were, nor what that
should be that would succeed.
