Tao gave birth to One,
One gave birth to Two,
Two gave birth to Three,
Three gave birth to all the myriad things.

All the myriad things carry the Yin on their backs and hold the Yang in
 their embrace,
Deriving their vital harmony from the proper blending of the two vital
 Breaths.

What is more loathed by men than to be "helpless," "little," and
 "worthless"?
And yet these are the very names the princes and barons call themselves.

Truly, one may gain by losing;
And one may lose by gaining.

What another has taught let me repeatï¼š
"A man of violence will come to a violent end."
Whoever said this can be my teacher and my father.
