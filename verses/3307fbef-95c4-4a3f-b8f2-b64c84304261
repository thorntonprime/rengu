Title: What Good Is a Book of Poems?
---
What good is a book of my poems if you are reading it while riding

in the back of a wagon that is heading toward the edge of a cliff?

A greater awareness is what our relationship is supposed to be about.

I was hoping something I might have said by now could have made you
stop, get your bearings,

and start traveling in a direction that will yield lots of fruit.
Maybe you are? That would be nice.
