If you treat other people as other, as separate, or as people different
from yourself, you will not be inclined to be fair or merciful in your
judgment of them. But if you treat other people as if they were just
versions of yourself, you will understand their errors and appreciate their
qualities.

Are we not fortunate that this is the way Heaven regards earth.
