In the beginning, verily, this world was non-existent. Therefrom, verily,
Being (sat) was produced. That made itself a Self (Âtman). Therefore it is
called the well-done. What that well-done is -- that, verily, is the essence
(rasa) of existence. For truly, on obtaining that essence, one becomes
blissful.
