Not that the Good is wholly incommunicable to anything; nay, rather, while
dwelling alone by Itself, and having there firmly fixed Its super-essential
Ray, It lovingly reveals Itself by illuminations corresponding to each separate
creatureâ€™s powers, and thus draws upwards holy minds into such contemplation,
participation and resemblance of Itself as they can attain -- even them that
holily and duly strive thereafter and do not seek with impotent presumption the
Mystery beyond that heavenly revelation which is so granted as to fit their
powers, nor yet through their lower propensity slip down the steep descent, but
with unwavering constancy press onwards toward the ray that casts its light
upon them and, through the love responsive to these gracious illuminations,
speed their temperate and holy flight on the wings of a godly reverence.
