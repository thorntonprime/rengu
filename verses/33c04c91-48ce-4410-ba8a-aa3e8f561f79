Title: An Ocean of Joy
---
An ocean of joy arises
    as all living things are liberated
It is all that I wish for --
    why would I care for my liberation alone?

I work for the liberation of others
    without pride or pretension
Moved only by the joy of benefiting others
    I do not hope for any reward

Just as I would act to protect myself
    from anything unpleasant, however small
So must I act toward others
    with a compassionate and caring mind
