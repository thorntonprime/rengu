And why the pentangel apendes 0 to that prince noble
I am intent you to telle, - thogh tary hit me shuldeï¼š
Hit is a signe that Salamon - set sumwhile
In bitokning of trawthe, - bi title that hit habbes,
For hit is a figure that haldes - five pointes.
And eche line umbelappes - and loukes in other,
And aywhere hit is endeles; - and Englich hit callen
Overal, as I here, - the endeles knot.
Forthy hit acordes to this knight - and to his cler armes,
For ay faithful in five - and sere five sithes
Gawan was for gode knawen, - and as golde pured,
Voided of eche vilany, - with vertues ennoumed in mote;

Forthy the pentangel newe
He ber in shelde and cote,
As tulk of tale most trewe
And gentilest knight of lote.
