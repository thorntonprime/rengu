Thus the creaturely self-will dies： it enters wholly into the
nothing, that it might no more live to itself, but to God.

Thus it falls out also in the philosophic work; when the artist has
first seen great wonders, which the creaturely and natural will has
wrought in the power of Venus, insomuch that he supposes that he is
nigh thereunto： even then nature does first die in his work, and
becomes a dark night unto him.
