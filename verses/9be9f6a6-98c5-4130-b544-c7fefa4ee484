Title: With a Pure and Empty Heart
---
My great obligation is to obey God, and to seek His will carefully with
a pure and empty heart. Not to try to impose my own order on my life but
let God impose His.To serve His will and His order by realizing them in my
own life. This means certainly a deep consent to all that is actually and
manifestly His will for me.

After dinner read the Prometheus Bound of Aeschylus. Shattered by it. I do not
know when I have read anything so stupendous and so completely contemporary. I
felt like throwing away everything and reading nothing but Aeschylus for six
months. Like discovering a mountain full of diamond mines. It is like Zen --
like Dostoevsky -- like existentialism -- like Francis -- like the New
Testament. It is inconceivably rich. I consider this a great grace. A great
religious experience. Prometheus, archetypal representation of the suffering
Christ. But we must go deep into this. Prometheus startles us by being more
fully Christ than the Lord of our own clich√©s -- I mean, he is free from
all the falsifications and limitations of our hackneyed vision which has
slowly emptied itself of reality.
