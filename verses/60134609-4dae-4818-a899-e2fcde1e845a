Title: Holding On to Nothing
---
God is using everything that happens to lead me into solitude. Every
creature that enters my life, every instant of my days is designed to
touch me with the sense ofthe world’s insufficiency. And that goes for
every created thing, including monasteries, including even sensible graces,
lights of the mind, ideas, fervor in the will. Everything I touch cauterizes
me with a light and healing burn, l can hold on to nothing.

It is useless to get upset over these things that pain me. The pain is
the token and pledge of God’s love for me. It is the promise of His
deep and perfect solitude.

Today I seemed to be very much assured that this solitude is indeed His
Will for me, and that it is truly He Who is calling me into the desert. Not
necessarily a geographical one, but the solitude ofHis own heart in Which
all created joys and light and satisfactions are annihilated and consumed.

Things that should have satisfied me, but did not.
