He who is overnice in hearing will be confused by the five notes,
bewitched by the six tones, by the sounds of metal and stone, strings
and woodwinds, the huang-chung and ta-lu pitch pipes - am I wrong? So
we have Music Master K'uang. He who is fork-fingered with benevolence
will tear out the Virtue given him and stifle his inborn nature in
order to seize fame and reputation, leading the world on with pipe and
drum in the service of an unattainable ideal - am I wrong? So we have
Tseng and Shih. He who is web-toed in argumentation will pile up
bricks, knot the plumb line, apply the curve, letting his mind wander
in the realm of "hard" and "white," "likeness" and "difference,"
huffing and puffing away, lauding his useless words - am I wrong? So we
have Yang and Mo.' All these men walk a way that is overnice, web-toed,
wide of the mark, fork-fingered, not that which is the True Rightness
of the world.
