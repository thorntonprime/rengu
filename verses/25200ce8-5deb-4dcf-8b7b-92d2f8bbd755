Title: The Best I Can Do for Moral Advice
---
Anyone you have made love with, it is because you were really looking
for God.

If you have known hundreds of partners, God may not say this publicly,
but I think He is proud of all your efforts.

Don't let the freedom in this truth get you in trouble.

There are men out there who get lonely up in the hills and then take
it out on their camels, sheep and goats.

I think about the best I can do today along the lines of moral advice,
in such a universe as we live, is to say,

try to not hurt any living thing, 'cause your odds will then,
probably, increase for happinessâ€”and who doesn't want some of that?
