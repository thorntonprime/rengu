Eternal blessedness lieth in one thing alone, and in nought else. And if
ever man or the soul is to be made blessed, that one thing alone must be in
the soul. Now some might ask, 'But what is that one thing?' I answer, it is
Goodness, or that which hath been made good; and yet neither this good nor
that, which we can name, or perceive or show . but it is all and above all
good things.
