Commentary: In mediaeval times astrology and astronomy formed a single
  cosmological science.

This science (of Astrology) more than any (other) is high and noble on account
of its high and noble subject (which is the movement of heaven), and high and
noble by its certainty, which is without any defect, as coming from a most
perfect and most regular principle. And if any conceive it to have a defect, it
does not belong to it, but, as Ptolemy says, comes of our negligence and to
that should be imputed.
