(The disbelievers) follow what the devils relate against the kingdom
of Solomon. And Solomon disbelieved not, but the devils disbelieved.
They teach men magical arts and what was revealed to the two angels of
Babel, Hârût and Mârût. But they taught no one until they had said：
Verily, we are but a temptation, so do not disbelieve. And from these
two they learn that by which they cause division between man and wife,
but they injure no one thereby save with the permission of Allâh. And
they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And they
surely (know that he who traffics therein has no share in the
Hereafter. And evil is the price for which they have sold their souls,
did they but know.
