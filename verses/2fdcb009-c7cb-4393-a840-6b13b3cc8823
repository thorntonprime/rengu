The Way creates one： one creates two：
Two creates three： three creates every being.
All beings carry the yin on their back
And embrace the yang in their arms,
Their gentleness achieves harmony.
Men hate the words ‘abandoned, humble, and unfortunate’
Yet rulers call themselves by these names.
So things are sometimes augmented
By being diminished,
And diminished by addition.
I teach what others also teach：
‘The violent won’t die a natural death.’
I adopt this as my basic principle.
