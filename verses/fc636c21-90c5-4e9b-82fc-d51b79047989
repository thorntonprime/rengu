Let not their conduct grieve thee, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they
injure Allâh not at all. It is Allâh’s Will to assign them no portion in the
Hereafter, and theirs will be an awful doom. ...

And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth
good unto their souls. We only give them rein that they may grow in
sinfulness. And theirs will be a shameful doom.
