One, however sinful, who loves God and surrenders himself to him, is
his beloved and his own. The mere name of God has power to save even the
most depraved. Wrongdoing is not eradicated merely by expiation if the
mind continues to follow wicked desires. But when the name of God and
God's love have purified the heart, then indeed are all sins completely
destroyed. ... Verily nothing is more purifying than the holy name of God.
