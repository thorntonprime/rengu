Title: The Climate of My Prayer
---
Our mentioning of the weather -- our perfunctory observations on what kind
of day it is -- are perhaps not idle. Perhaps we have a deep and legitimate
need to know in our entire being what the day is like, to see it and feel
it, to know how the sky is grey, paler in the south, with patches of blue
in the southwest, with snow on the ground, the thermometer at 18, and cold
wind making your ears ache, l have a real need to know these things because I
myself am part of the weather and part of the climate and part of the place,
and a day in which I have not shared truly in all this is no day at all. It
is certainly part of my life of prayer.
