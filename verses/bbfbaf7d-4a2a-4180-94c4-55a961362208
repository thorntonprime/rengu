Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
A man of Sung who sold ceremonial hats made a trip to Yueh, but the
Yueh people cut their hair short and tattoo their bodies and had no use
for such things. Yao brought order to the people of the world and
directed the government of all within the seas. But he went to see the
Four Masters of the faraway Ku-she ï¼šMountain, [and when he got home]
north of the Fen. River, he was dazed and had forgotten his kingdom
there.
