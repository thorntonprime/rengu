Title: Diffferent Loads
---
Do not feed both sides of yourself equally.
The spirit and the body carry different loads
and require different attentions.

Too often we put saddlebags on Jesus,
and let the donkey run loose in the pasture.

Do not make the body do what the spirit does best,
and don't put a big load on the spirit
that the body could carry easily.
