Title: Women in Their Tender Way
---
God listens more to women's prayers than men's when women are in their
 tender way.
Because often they have achieved with the blessings of earth
what a man can rarely do on his ownï¼š bring empathy, sensitivity and kindness
 into the heart and mind,
and make the voice more tender, one's touch more gentle, one's plea more
 powerful from it being so sincere.
It is holy, blood. And all that can come from a body.
As if it were part of God, everything should be enshrined.
