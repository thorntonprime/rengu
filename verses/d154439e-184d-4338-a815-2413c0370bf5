Strategists sayï¼š
"Rather play the guest than dare to host."
"Rather retreat a foot than advance an inch."

Advance without armies.
Ward off without arms.
Cast out without confronting.
Pursue without weapons.

No misfortune is greater
than mistaking a worthy opponent.
Not thinking your opponent worthy,
you sacrifice your touchstone.

When well matched forces meet,
who sees the loss will win.
