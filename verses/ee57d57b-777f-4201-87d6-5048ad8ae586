Do I have a self or not, or is there one at all?
A right me, oh my belly, or, perhaps again, a wrong
 one!
Shall I go right on thinking just like this,
or go back and sit in meditation on the cliff,
green grass growing up between my feet
and the red dust dropping on my head?
All the while the common folk
think I'm a saintï¼š
laying fruit and wine around me,
as if to decorate my bier.
