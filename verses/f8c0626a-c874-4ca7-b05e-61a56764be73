There is nothing in the world easier than goodness and nothing more
difficult than depravity. By ‘goodness’ is meant tranquillity of mind,
undisturbed by cupidity. By ‘depravity’ is meant a grasping spirit
with many cravings. He who is satisfied with the simple needs of his
nature, refusing the superfluous delights of the world, will not be
tempted by any seductions. He who follows the law of his nature, will
preserve his soul, without any inward conflicts. Hence the statement
‘It is easy to be good.’ Clambering up city walls, scaling dangerous
heights, thieving the official keys, forging and stealing official money,
rebelling and murdering, lying and bearing false witness, are acts
contrary to human nature. Hence the saying, ‘It is difficult to be bad.’
