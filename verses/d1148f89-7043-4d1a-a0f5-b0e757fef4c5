Title: Not Knowing Exactly What Is Going On
---
You are newly hatched, so when someone comes by to feed you with some
 friendship or even something well cooked,
your beak on occasion sticks them in the neck, not knowing exactly what is
 going on.
Even when the Beloved lands on your limb with a fresh worm of guidance
 or wisdom,
your clumsiness can persist, and He too gets poked.
That is why I thought I might keep a safe distance from you, maybe that of
 a few hundred years
until you settle down, and get things properly worked out.
