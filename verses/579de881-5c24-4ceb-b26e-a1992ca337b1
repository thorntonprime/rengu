If you want happiness for an hour -- take a nap. If you want happiness for
a day -- go fishing. If you want happiness for a month -- get married. If
you want happiness for a year -- inherit a fortune. If you want happiness
for a lifetime -- help someone else. If you want eternal happiness --
know yourself.
