To those desiring to learn the great and hidden good it is authority which
opens the door. And whoever enters by it and, leaving doubt behind, follows
the precepts for a truly good life, and has been made receptive to teaching
by them, will at length learn how pre-eminently possessed of reason those
things are which he pursued before he saw their reason, and what that reason
itself is, which, now that he is made steadfast and equal to his task in
the cradle of authority, he now follows and comprehends, and he learns what
that intelligence is in which are all things, or rather what He is who is
all things, and what beyond and above all things is their prime cause.
