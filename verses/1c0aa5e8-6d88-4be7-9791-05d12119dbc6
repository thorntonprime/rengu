When ... I prayed with my heart, everything around me seemed delightful and
marvellous. The trees, the grass, the birds, the earth, the air, the light
seemed to be telling me that they existed for manâ€™s sake, that they witnessed
to the love of God for man, that everything proved the love of God for man,
that all things prayed to God and sang His praise.
