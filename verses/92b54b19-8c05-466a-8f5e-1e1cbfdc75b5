IN THE NORTHERN DARKNESS there is a fish and his name is K'un. The
K'un is so huge I don't know how many thousand li he measures. He
changes and becomes a bird whose name is P'eng. The back of the P'eng
measures I don't know how many thousand li across and, when he rises up
and flies off, his wings are like clouds all over the sky. When the sea
begins to move, this bird sets off for the southern darkness, which is
the Lake of Heaven.
