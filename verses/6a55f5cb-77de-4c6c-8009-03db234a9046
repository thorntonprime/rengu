All creatures are a mere naught. I say not they are small, are aughtï¼š they are
absolutely naught. A thing without being is not (or is naught). Creatures have
no real being, for their being consists in the presence of God. If God turned
away for an instant they would all perish. I have sometimes said, and it is
triie, that he who has gotten the whole world plus God has gotten no more than
God by himself. Having all creatures without God is no more than having one fly
without God; just the same, no more nor less.
