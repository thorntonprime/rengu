---
Favour and disgrace are like fear. Honour and distress are like the self.
What does this mean? Favour debases us. Afraid when we get it, Afraid when
 we lose it.
The self embodies distress. No self, No distress.
Respect the world as your self： The world can be your lodging. Love the
 world as your self： The world can be your trust.
