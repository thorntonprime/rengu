The Divine Love in every Person or Spirit lives not in it self as a part, but
in the life or the whole, in the Divine, the Universal Spirit, the Spirit of
Love, the Spirit of the whole. I live not, saith St Paul, but Christ liveth in
me. Again, I f you live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit. Thus the Divine Love
having its life in each person, in the life of the whole, the Universal Spirit,
being one Spirit with that Spirit, which is the Unity of the whole,
comprehendeth all things with strictest tenderest imbraces in it self, as one
self with it self.
