He thought within himself that this world was far better than Paradise had
men eyes to see its glory, and their advantages. For the very miseries and
sins and offences that are in it are the materials of his joy and triumph
and glory. So that he is to learn a diviner art that will now be happy,
and that is like a royal chemist to reign among poisons, to turn scorpions
into fishes, weeds into flowers, bruises into ornaments, poisons into cordials.
And he that cannot learn this art, of extracting good out of evil, is to be
accounted nothing. Heretofore, to enjoy beauties, and be grateful for benefits
was all the art that was required to felicity, but now a man must, like a God,
bring Light out of Darkness, and order out of confusion. Which we are taught
to do by His wisdom, that ruleth in the midst of storms and tempests.
