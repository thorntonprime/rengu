By: John Smith the Platonist
Commentary: |
  The particular structure of the Qur’ân, for example, results from the
  translation of archetypal Idea into a temporal mode corresponding at its
  level with the spiritual Prototype in immediacy of concept, image and sound;
  cf. Schuon： Comprendre l ’Islam, ch. II, and Burckhardt; Introduction
  aux Doctrines ésotériques de l ’Islam, pp. 45-46.

For the better understanding all prophetical writ, we must observe. That
there is sometimes a seeming inconsistence in things spoken of, if we shall
come to examine them by the strict logical rules of method; we must not
therefore, in the matter of any prophetical vision, look for a constant
methodical contexture of things carried on in a perpetual coherence. The
prophetical spirit doth not tie itself to these rules of art, or thus knit
up its dictates systematically, fitly framing one piece or member into a
combination with the rest, as it were with the joints and sinews of method;
for this indeed would rather argue a human and artificial contrivance than
any inspiration, which, as it must beget a transportation in the mind, so
it must spend itself in such abrupt kind of revelations as may argue indeed
the prophet to have been inspired.
