When we approach these temples we must cleanse our bodies, our minds and
our hearts and we should enter them in a prayerful mood and ask God to
make us purer men and purer women for having entered their portals. And
if you will take this advice of an old man, this physical deliverance that
you have secured will be a deliverance of the soul.
