Title: The Sweet Blade of Your Anger
---
What is the use of going to see a mountain cliff
if your face is not there?

Why hear the secret of secrets
if you are not mentioned?

If Adam and Eve and their family knew nothing of you,
whom should I ask?

What if I get prosperity and honors
and all the satisfactions anyone could want,
and never meet you?

What use is understanding
if I do not see the blade of your anger
with honey curling around it?

What use is water, wedding gifts, Joseph's soul,
sparks igniting hair?

The hundreds of lies composing one truth?
The two worlds calling each other?

I praise stray dofs on the street,
lions wandering wilderness, and Shams Tabriz
It does not matter what I say.
