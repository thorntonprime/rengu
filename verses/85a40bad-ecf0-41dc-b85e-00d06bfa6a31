Title: Fengxue's One Dust
---
Fengxue handed down words saying, If the one dust is
established the home country prospers. If the one dust is not
established, the home country is mournfully lost.

Xuedou picked up the staff and said, Still, patch-robed
monks do you have the same birth and the same death?

The people in ancient accord with the teaching do not unfurrow the
eyebrows

They just plan on the home country establishing a strong foundation.

Scheming ministers and fierce generals, now where are they?

For ten thousand miles the clear wind and only oneself knows.
