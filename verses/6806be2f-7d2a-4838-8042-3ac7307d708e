Title: Sunlight on a Vase of Carnations
---
Beauty of the sunlight falling on a tall vase of red and white carnations
and green leaves on the altar in the novitiate. The light and shade of the
red, especially the darkness in the fresh crinkled flower and the light warm
red around the darkness, the same color as blood but not â€œred as blood,"
utterly unlike blood. Red as a carnation. This flower, this light, this
moment, this silence = Dominus est, eternity! Best because the flower is
itself and the light is itself and the silence is itself and I am myself --
all, perhaps, an illusion, but no matter, for illusion is nevertheless the
shadow of reality and reality is the grace that underlies these lights,
these colors, and this silence.

The "simplicity" that would have kept those flowers off the altar is, to my
mind, less simple than the simplicity that enjoys them there, but does not
need them to be there.
