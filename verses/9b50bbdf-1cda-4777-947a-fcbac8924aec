Title: A Single Undivided Love
---
When I open my heart to receive You
in times of peace and quiet, this is as

it should be, but if I close my heart
to You when I have lost my way and

my life is a mess. I have failed to know
the truth, for these differ only for me

but not for You, for Your heart opens
to me with a single undivided love.
