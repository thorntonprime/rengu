Title: An Artist's Blessing
---
Why would a rich man sweep the streets from morning till night,
and with a broom that causes his back to bend over to the point of now aching
 all the time?
There are people like that around, who could live in a garden paradise and
 never know of the common man’s suff ering,
but instead stay among us, rolling up their sleeves, drawing from the well
 until their hands are blistered and calloused.
They might pass out for a few hours, then get up early and pick up their pens,
 chisels, or brushes again.
Find someone like that, offer help. Next to a saint, a true artist’s
 blessing can do the most for this world and you.
