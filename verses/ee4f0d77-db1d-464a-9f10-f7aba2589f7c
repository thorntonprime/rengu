Title: The Further You Go
---
Mercy, there have been revelations.
Grace, there has been realisation. Still, you must
travel the path of time and circumstance.
The further you go, the more it comes back to paying attention.
The rough skin of the tallowwood, the trade routes of lorikeets,
 a sky lifting
behind afternoon clouds. Staying close to the texture of things.
People can go before you and talk all they want,
but only one thing makes sense： the way the world enters
and finds its voice in you： the place you are free.
