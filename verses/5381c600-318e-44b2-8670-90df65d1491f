Commentary: \'These rites' refers to Hunkapi, â€˜the making of relatives',
  i.e. peace with other tribes.

Through these rites a three-fold peace was established. The first peace, which
is the most important, is that which comes within the souls of men when they
realize their relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its
Powers, and when they realize that at the center of the universe dwells
Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of
us. This is the real Peace, and the others are but reflections of this. The
second peace is that which is made between two individuals, and the third is
that which is made between two nations. But above all you should understand
that there can never be peace between nations until there is first known that
true peace which, as I have often said, is within the souls of men.
