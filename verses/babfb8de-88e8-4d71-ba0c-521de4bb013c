When you think of a thing, you impart existence to it. Objects which cause
desire to arise disappear when the mindâ€™s eye closes to them. They blend
into the scenery.

It is the same with emotions. Hopes, fears, judgments of right and wrong,
and feelings of pleasure or misery also vanish when the mind remains
uninvolved in the worldly events that occasioned them. When uncluttered by
worldly refuse, the empty mind can hold infinite space. Peace pervades its
purity, heaven gleams, and the harmony of the spheres resonates throughout.
