This state of mere inherence in pure Being (Quiescence or Mound) is known as
the Vision of Wisdom. Such inherence means and implies the entire subsidence
of the mind in the Self. Anything other than this and all psychic powers of
the mind, such as thought-reading, telepathy and clairvoyance, cannot be
Wisdom.
