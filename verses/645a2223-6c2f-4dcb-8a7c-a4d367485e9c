Commentary: Fortunatus was an inveterate disbleiever.

And John, when he saw the unchanged mind (soul) of Fortunatus, said：
O nature that is not changed for the better! O fountain of the soul
that abideth in foulness! O essence of corruption full of darkness! O
death exulting in them that are thine!  O fruitless tree full of fire!
O tree that bearest coals for fruit! O matter that dwellest with the
madness of matter and neighbour of unbelief! Thou hast proved who thou
art, and thou art always convicted, with thy children. And thou
knowest not how to praise the better things： for thou hast them not.
Therefore, such as is thy way, such also is thy root and thy nature.
Be thou destroyed from among them that trust in the Lord： from their
thoughts, from their mind, from their souls, from their bodies, from
their acts, their life, their conversation, from their business, their
occupations, their counsel, from the resurrection unto God, from their
sweet savour wherein thou wilt not share, from their faith, their
prayers, from the holy bath, from the eucharist, from the food of the
flesh, from drink, from clothing, from love, from care, from
abstinence, from righteousness： from all these, thou most unholy
Satan, enemy of God, shall Jesus Christ our God and the judge of all
that are like thee and have thy character, make thee to perish.
