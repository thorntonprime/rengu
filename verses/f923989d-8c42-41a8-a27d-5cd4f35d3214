Title: A Mime
Description: October 6
---
A mime stands upon a gallows for a crime he did not do. When given a last
 chance to speak he remains true to his art.
A crowd of hundreds has gathered to see his last performance, knowing he
 will not talk.
The mime takes from the sky the circle of bright spheres, lays them on a
 table, expressing deep love for the companionship and guidance they have
 given him for so many years.
He brings the seas before our eyes. Somehow an emerald fin appears,
 splashes. Look, there is turquoise rain.
He removes his heart from his body and seems to arouse all life on this
 splendid earth with such a sacred tenderness;
there, for an extraordinary moment, it looked like someone was giving birth
 to the Christ again.
He mounts his soul upon the body of Freedom. The great breeze comes by. The
 sun and moon join hands; they bow so gracefully
that for a moment, for a moment everyone knows that God is real. So the
 tongue fell out of the mouth of the world for days.
