Title: Cuckoo
---
The cuckoo cries its heart out.
It cries and when it can cry no more,
it cries blood.

The bitterness of parting is not yours alone.
I cannot cry even though I want to.
I’m not a cuckoo, and that bitterness can’t be helped either.

The heartless cuckoo：
I have nowhere to return, and yet it cries,
“Better turn back, better turn back.”
