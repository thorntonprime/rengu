“But why should you, friend, be so very solicitous about the safety of
the king?”

“Oh,” replied the good man, " because I honor him more than I do any
one else, and love him more than myself.”

“But what good has he ever done you,” asked the king (in disguise),
“that you should hold him in high esteem? Methinks you would be rather
more comfortably lodged and clothed were you any extraordinary favorite
of his.”

“Not so,” answered the fisherman, “for tell me, Sir Knight, what
greater favor can I receive from my honored king, in my humble sphere,
than to be protected in the enjoyment of my house and goods, and the little
earnings which I make? All I have I owe to his kindness, to the wisdom and
justice with which he rules over his subjects, preserving us in peace or
protecting us in war from the inroads of the Arabs, as well as all other
enemies. Even I, a poor fisherman, with a wife and little family, am not
forgotten, and enjoy my poverty in peace. He permits me to fish for eels
wherever I please, and take them afterwards to the best market I can find,
in order to provide for my little ones. At any hour, night or day, I go
out or I come in just as I like, to or fro, in my humble dwelling; and
there is not a single person in all these neighboring woods and valleys
who has ever dared to do me wrong. To whom am I indebted for all this,
but to him for whom I daily offer up my prayers to God and our holy
prophet to watch over his preservation?"
