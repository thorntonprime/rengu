The object of your search should be to find a hidden thing from which, by a
marvellous artifice, there is obtained a liquid by whose means gold is
dissolved as gently and naturally as ice is melted in warm water. If you can
find this substance, you have that out of which Nature produced gold, and
though all metals and all things are derived from it, yet it takes most kindly
to gold. For all other things are clogged with impurity, except gold wherein
there is no uncleanness, whence in a special manner this matter is, as it were,
the mother of gold.
