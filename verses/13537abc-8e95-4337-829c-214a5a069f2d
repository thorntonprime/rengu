The mysteries of God. of grace, of nature, of time and eternity can no other
possible way be opened in man but by this simplicity of a godly life taught in
the Gospel, because only the godly life hath knowledge of God. just as the
creaturely life hath only knowledge of the creature and the painful life hath
knowledge of pain.
