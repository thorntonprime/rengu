Title: Come
---
Come, please come. It’s time.
Do you know when you’re supposed to come?
The time to come is when I’m waiting.

Come in to my garden, the flowers are blooming there.
Should anyone chase you, hide in the blossoms.
I’ll turn into a butterfly and light upon the ones you hide among.
Then your pursuer won’t find you.
Come, please come. It’s time.

Come in to my arms, my breast is soft there.
Should anyone chase you, sink your head into my breast.
Though I’m soft as water, I’m a golden sword and iron shield
 to protect you.
Should my breast be like petals trampled by horses,
 your head still won’t fall.
Then your pursuer won’t touch you.
Come, please come. It’s time.

Come in to my death, my death is always ready for you.
Should anyone chase you, stand behind my death.
In death, emptiness and omnipotence are one.
Love’s death is at once infinite, everlasting.
In death, battleship and fortress become dust.
In death, the strong and the weak are companions.
Then your pursuer won’t catch you.
Come, please come. It’s time.
