The best inscription of the Name of Jesus is that to be found in the innermost
heart of hearts; the next best is in words, and finally the visible Name
written or carved. If the bodily eye be constantly confronted with it, it
will soon become visible to the eye of the heart, that inward spiritual eye
of the soul.
