When the spirit of darkness and of foul odour is rejected, so that no
stench and no shadow of darkness appear, then the body is clothed with
light and the soul and spirit rejoice because darkness has fled from the
body. And the soul, calling to thé body that has been filled with light,
says： ‘Awaken from Hades! Arise from the tomb and rouse thyself from
darkness! For thou hast clothed thyself with spirituality and divinity,
since the voice of the resurrection has sounded and the medicine of life
has entered into thee.' For the spirit is again made glad in the body, as
is also the soul, and runs with joyous haste to embrace it and does embrace
it. Darkness no longer has dominion over the body, since it is a subject of
light and they will not suffer separation again for eternity. And the soul
rejoices in her home, because after the body had been hidden in darkness,
she found it filled with light. And she united with it, since it had become
divine towards her, and it is now her home. For it had put on the light of
divinity and darkness had departed from it. And the body and the soul and
the spirit were all united in love and had become one, in which unity the
mystery had been concealed. In their being united together the mystery has
been accomplished, its dwelling place sealed up and a monument erected full
of light and divinity.
