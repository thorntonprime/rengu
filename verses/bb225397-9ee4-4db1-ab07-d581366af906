Sin is nothing better than a brat of darkness and deformity; it hath no other
extraction or pedigree than may be derived from those unclean spirits that
are nestled in hell. All men in reality converse either with God or with the
devil, and walk in the confínes either of heaven or of hell： they have their
fellowship either with the Father and the Son, as St John speaks; or else with
the apostate and evil angels.
