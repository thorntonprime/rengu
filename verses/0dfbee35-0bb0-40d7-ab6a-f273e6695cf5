There was once a goldsmith whose tongue suddenly turned up and stuck
to his palate. He looked like a man in sam√¢dhi. He became completely
inert and remained so a long time. People came to worship him. After
several years, his tongue suddenly returned to its natural position,
and he became conscious of things as before. So he went back to his
work as a goldsmith.
