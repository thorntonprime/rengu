Sound produced from ether is known as 'unstruck'. In this unstruck sound the
Gods delight. The Yogis, the Great Spirits, projecting their minds by an effort
of the mind into this unstruck sound, depart, attaining Liberation.

Struck sound is said to give pleasure, ‘unstruck’ sound gives Liberation.

This (unstruck sound) having no relation with human enjoyment does not interest
ordinary men.
