Title: Pray to Your Hand
---
The foundation for insanity is laid, and every moment it increases as the
  universe expands.

Too convincing for most everyone is form to then not call it real. And to not
  then be its wholehearted servant at times.

Some balance, dear, some delicate discernment is required between what appears
  to be and what really is not.

Let it often come down to this, for the right equation you need to solve the
  big dilemma is just too vast for most.

Yes, let it come down to this, when thoughts and aspects of the infinite can no
  longer delight youï¼š

Pray to your hand that it reveals all the wonder you will ever need to be
  satisfied. For it is there. The divine mystery is in all things.
