There a father becomes not a father; a mother, not a mother; the worlds,
not the worlds; the gods, not the gods; the Vedas, not the Vedas; a thief,
not a thief. There the destroyer of an embryo becomes not the destroyer of
an embryo; a Cândâla (the son of a Sûdra father and a Brahman mother)
is not a Cândâla; a Paulkasa (the son of a Sûdra father and a Kshatriya
mother) is not a Paulkasa; a mendicant is not a mendicant; an ascetic is
not an ascetic. He is not followed by good, he is not followed by evil,
for then he has passed beyond all sorrows of the heart.
