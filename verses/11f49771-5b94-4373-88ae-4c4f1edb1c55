And Cleopatra going with John into her bedchamber, and seeing
Lycomedes dead for her sake, had no power to speak, and ground her
teeth and bit her tongue, and closed her eyes, raining down tears：
and with calmness gave heed to the apostle.  But John had compassion
on Cleopatra when he saw that she neither raged nor was beside
herself, and called upon the perfect and condescending mercy, saying：
Lord Jesus Christ, thou seest the pressure of sorrow, thou seest the
need： thou seest Cleopatra shrieking her soul out in silence, for she
constraineth within her the frenzy that cannot be borne.
