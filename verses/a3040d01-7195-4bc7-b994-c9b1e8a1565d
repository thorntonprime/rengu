What is the opposite of water?
    A skeleton frowning,
    three femurs in a ditch,
    a honeycomb filling the
    gooey heart-hole, spilling
What is the opposite of a parade?
    a familiar voice, thundercracked
    across the sky; a crowâ€™s tongue
    split in two, the crow speaking
    short stabbing sentences, making
What is the opposite of a guess?
    love in the form of a mistake,
    you and me in the form of
    Cygnus in July -- or perhaps
    Draco, but there seems to be
What is the opposite of a constellation?
    a quorum of light receding
    from where we are to where
    we came from -- two mirrors
    facing each other, shattered.
