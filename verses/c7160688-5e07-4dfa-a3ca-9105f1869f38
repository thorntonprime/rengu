As a pearl-oyster patiently and eagerly awaits the drops of rain when the
star Swati is in ascendency, receives the drop and converts it in itself,
through its own efforts and processes, into a very valuable pearl, the
Sadhaka eagerly and devoutly awaits Mantrainitiation from the Guru, receives
the sacred Mantra from him on the rare auspicious occasion, cherishes it and
nurtures it in himself, and by his effort or process of Sadhana transforms
it into a tremendous spiritual power which breaks the fort of Avidya or
ignorance and opens the door to the blissful Immortal Experience.
