Please train yourselves thusï¼š In the seen, there will he just the seen. In the
heard, there will he iust the heard. In the sensed, there will he just the
sensed. In the cognized, there will be just the cognized. When for you, in the
seen there is just the seen, in the heard just the heard, in the sensed just
the sensed, in the cognized just the cognized, then you will not identify with
the seen, and so on. And if you do not identify with them, you will not he
located in them; if you are not located in them, there will be no here, no
there, or in-between. And this will he the end of suffering.
