Title: And Words Like These
---
Tilled ground the soft heart, and words like these the seeds,

and words like these the water, and words like these a sun.

Beneath the surface of this game, behind the veil, all is working on
your behalf.

Surely then you will rise up and embrace what will make you most
happy.
