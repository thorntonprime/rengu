Title: Pick the Lock
Description: June 24
---
There are so many keys on your ring, so many fine spiritual sayings you can
 recite, and maybe so many pictures of saints in your house.
But you rarely work hard enough, peer deep enough, to pick the lock.
You should have stopped reading pages ago, if not in this book, in another,
and just sat down and done whatever it took to grab God by the tail and pull
 Him from a cave in you.
