Title: Necessary Experiences
---
Two inner experiences were necessary for the creation of these books (The
Sonnets to Orpheus and The Duino Elegies). One is the increasingly conscious
decision to hold life open to death. The other is the spiritual imperative
to present, in this wider context, the transformations of love that are not
possible in a narrower circle where Death is simply excluded as The Other.
