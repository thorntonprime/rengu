Devotion to Truth is the sole reason, for our existence. All our
activities should be centred in Truth. Truth should be the very breath
of our life. When once this stage in the pilgrim's progress is reached,
all other rules of correct living will come without effort, and obedience
to them will be instinctive. But without Truth it would be impossible to
observe any principles or rules in life.
