There is communion between soul and soul. The souls of the gods are in
communion with those of men, and the souls of men with those of the creatures
without reason. And God takes care of all; for He is higher than all. The
Kosmos then is subject to God; man is subject to the Kosmos; the creatures
without reason are subject to man; and God is above all, and watches over all.
