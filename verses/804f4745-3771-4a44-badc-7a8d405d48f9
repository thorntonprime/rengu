Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
To hope to practice the ways of Chou in the state of Lu is like trying
to push a boat over land - a great deal of work, no success, and
certain danger to the person who tries it. The man who tries to do so
has failed to understand the turning that has no direction, that
responds to things and is never at a loss.
