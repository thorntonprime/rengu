The greatest warrior is not formidable.
The greatest fighter is never angry.
The best strategist never encounters the enemy.
The best employer of talent is humble.
This is known as the power of non-contention.
This is known as respecting othersâ€™ talents.
This is known as echoing the profundity of heaven.
