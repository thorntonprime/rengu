\"Hence it is said the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is on the
outside. Virtue resides in the Heavenly. Understand the actions of
Heaven and man, base yourself upon Heaven, take vour stand in virtue
, and then, although you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you
may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate."
