My life's grown from old roots on Cold Mountain,
on the stone cliffs, perched, heart breathing free.
At the end no mere image ever leaves scarsï¼š
I'm settled in to watch this universe flow by.
Time's light and shadows rise, a flutter of brilliance,
shining where my heart dwells.
Being, and nothingness, one dharma before me.
The tool I use shines from the Pearl of Wisdom.
When you know the use of the method
that is no method at all, then every single place
 is perfect.
