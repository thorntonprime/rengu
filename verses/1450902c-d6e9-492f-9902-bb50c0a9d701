Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
When the Perfect Man rules the world, he has hold of a huge thing, does
he not? - yet it is not enough to snare him in entanglement. He works
the handles that control the world, but is not a party to the workings.
He sees clearly into what has no falsehood and is unswayed by thoughts
of gain. He ferrets out the truth of things and knows how to cling to
the source. Therefore he can put Heaven and earth outside himself,
forget the ten thousand things, and his spirit has no cause to be
wearied. He dismisses benevolence and righteousness, rejects rites
and music, for the mind of the Perfect Man knows where to find repose.
