Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
Lieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and
breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as
the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped
the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get
around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden
the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the
boundless, then what would he have had to depend on?
