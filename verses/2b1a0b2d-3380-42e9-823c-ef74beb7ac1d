Your attitude toward your body should be pure, friendly, respectful, and
affectionate. The body has been manâ€™s companion and friend through many
births, through many different journeys of pain and happiness. The body is a
fundamental necessity ofxadhana. It is the ladder to the city ofliberation;
it is the great temple ofthe inner Self. In the innermost part of this
bodily temple, God, the Lord of love, lives as the inner Self. Muktananda
therefore says that, when a Siddha student achieves understanding of the
body and sees that it is the temple of the inner Self, he will never do
anything unfriendly to it nor involve it in anything degrading nor defile
it through depraved or immoral acts.

Some people regard the body as a place of pleasure, like a club or a hotel
or a cinema, and thus destroy its purity and lose their Shakti. In my
opinion, they insult their bodies instead of honoring them and treating
them justly. There are also some disturbed people who torture and repress
their pure and friendly bodies in a way that is cruel and unnatural. Their
hearts, which should be filled with love, are filled with lamentation. They
hurt their bodies day and night. They constantly pray to the Lord to
free them from the prison of the body. But the truth is that your body
is without fault.
