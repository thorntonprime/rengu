Then I turned my attention to the Way of the Sufis. I knew that it could not be
traversed to the end without both doctrine and practice, and that the gist of
the doctrine lies in overcoming the appetites of the flesh and getting rid of
its evil dispositions and vile qualities, so that the heart may be cleared of
all but God ; and the means of clearing it is dhikr Allah, i.e, commemoration
of God and concentration of every thought upon Him. Now, the doctrine was
easier to me than the practice, so I began by learning their doctrine from the
books and sayings of their Shaykhs, until I acquired as much of their Way as it
is possible to acquire by learning and hearing, and saw plainly that what is
most peculiar to them cannot be learned, but can only be reached by immediate
experience and ecstasy and inward transformation. ... I looked on myself as I
then was. Worldly interests encompassed me on every side. ... I realised that I
stood on the edge of a precipice and would fall into Hell-fire unless I set
about to mend my ways. ... Conscious of my helplessness and having surrendered
my will entirely. I took refuge with God as a man in sore trouble who has no
resource left. God answered my prayer and made it easy for me to turn my back
on reputation and wealth and wife and children and friends.
