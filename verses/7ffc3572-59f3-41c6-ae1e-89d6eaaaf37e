Title: Opening the Heart's Door
---
Ours is not the work
of seeking You here
or there where we

think You might be,
but of opening
the heart’s door,

and when we do this
You cannot resist
coming in, since

our opening and Your
entering are one： You
knock and wait, and

when we open we
find that You were
there all along and

will not leave us.
