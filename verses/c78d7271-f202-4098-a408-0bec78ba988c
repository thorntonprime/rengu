(The soul) knows that God will never forsake his own life which he
hath quickened in it： he will never deny those ardent desires of a
blissful fruition of himself, which the lively sense of his own
goodness hath excited within it： those breathings and gaspings after
an eternal participation of him are but the energy of his own breath
within us; if he had had any mind to destroy it, he would never have
shown it such things as he hath done; he would not raise it up to such
mounts of vision, to show it all the glory of that heavenly Canaan
flowing with eternal and unbounded pleasures, and then precipitate it
again into that deep and darkest abyss of death and non-entity. Divine
goodness cannot, it will not. be so cruel to holy souls that are such
ambitious suitors for his love.
