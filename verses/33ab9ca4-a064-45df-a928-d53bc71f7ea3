God, rest in my heart
and fortify me,
take away my hunger for answers,
let the hours play upon my body

like the hands of my beloved.
Let the cathead appear again --
the smallest of your mysteries,
some wild cousin of my own blood probably --
some cousin of my own wild blood probably,
in the black dinner-bowl of the pond.
