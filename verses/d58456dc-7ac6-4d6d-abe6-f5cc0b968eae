Commentary: The allusion here is to the souls in purgatory.

Those who have merited paradise will enter therein ; the damned will
go to hell. God will then sayï¼š Let those leave hell whose hearts
contain faith even the weight of a mustard seed!  Then they will be
let out, although they have already been burned to ashes, and plunged
into the river of rain-water, or into the river of life; and
immediately they will be revived.
