\‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself’ is another full proof that God is
in us of a truth and that the Holy Spirit hath as certainly an essential birth
within us as the spirit of this world hath. For this precept might as well be
given to a fox as to a man, if man had not something quite supernatural in him.
For mere nature and natural creature is nothing else but mere self, and can
work nothing but to and for itself. And this not through any corruption or
depravity of nature, but because it is nature's best state and it can be
nothing else either in man or beast.
