Title: Without Thought of Loving
---
I only find You when I let go
of what I expect, and I only seek

You truly when I bring my
nothingness to You, beyond

all my certainties and doubts,
for in the hollow of my not-

knowing there is room for the
fullness of Your all-loving,

for You give all of Yourself
without thought of loving,

as simply and wholly as
the sun when it shines

as it ever does.
