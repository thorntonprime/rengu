Title: The Artist
---
I’m a clumsy painter.
Sleepless, my finger traced your nose, your lips,
  even your dimple, on my breast.
Then, I drew the slight smile that hovers around your eyes,
but I erased it a hundred times over.

I’m an amateur singer.
The neighbors gone and the insects quiet, I wanted to sing the song
  you taught me,
but I felt shy seeing the dozing cat.
So I softly joined the chorus of the breeze that fluttered
  against the paper door.

I don’t have the makings of a lyric poet.
I don’t want to write about “joy” or “sorrow” or “love.”
I want to capture exactly your face, your voice, your walk.
I’ll write about your house, your bed, and even the pebbles
  in your flower garden.
