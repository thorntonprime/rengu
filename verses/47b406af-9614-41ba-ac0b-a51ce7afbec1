Yen Hui said to Confucius, "When Meng-sun Ts'ai's mother died, he
wailed without shedding any tears, he did not grieve in his heart, and
he conducted the funeral without any look of sorrow. He fell down on
these three counts, and yet he is known all over the state of Lu for
the excellent way he managed the funeral. Is it really possible to gain
such a reputation when there are no facts to support it? I find it very
peculiar indeed!"
