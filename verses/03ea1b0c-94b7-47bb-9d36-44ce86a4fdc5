Title: The Sign of the Mysterious
Commentary: |
  As a model for the Taoist, the baby is in many ways ideal： totally
  unaltruistic, not interested in politics, business, or the proprieties,
  weak, soft, and able to scream placidly for hours without wearing itself
  out (its parents are another matter). The baby’s unawareness of poisonous
  insects and carnivorous beasts means that such dangers simply do not exist
  for it. (Again, its parents are a different case.)

  As a metaphor of the Tao, the baby embodies the eternal beginning, the
  ever-springing source. “We come, trailing clouds of glory,” Wordsworth says;
  and Hopkins, “There lives the dearest freshness deep down things.” No Peter
  Panish refusal to grow up is involved, no hunt for the fountain of youth. What
  is eternal is forever young, never grows old. But we are not eternal.

  It is in this sense that I understand how the natural, inevitable cycle
  of youth, growth, mature vigor, age, and decay can be “not the Way.”
  The Way is more than the cycle of any individual life. We rise, flourish,
  fail. The Way never fails. We are waves. It is the sea.

Being full of power
is like being a baby.
Scorpions don’t sting,
tigers don’t attack,
eagles don’t strike.
Soft bones, weak muscles,
but a firm grasp.
Ignorant of the intercourse
of man and woman,
yet the baby penis is erect.
True and perfect energy!
All day long screaming and crying,
but never getting hoarse.
True and perfect harmony!

To know harmony
is to know what’s eternal.
To know what’s eternal
is enlightenment.
Increase of life is full of portent：
the strong heart exhausts the vital breath.
The full-grown is on the edge of age.
Not the Way.
What’s not the Way soon dies.
