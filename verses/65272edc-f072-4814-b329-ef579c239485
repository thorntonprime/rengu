Title: Only God I Saw
---
In the market, in the cloister -- only God I saw.
In the valley and on the mountain -- only God I saw.
Him I have seen beside me oft in tribulation;
In favour and in fortune -- only God I saw.
In prayer and fasting, in praise and contemplation,
In the religion of the Prophet -- only God I saw.
Neither soul nor body, accident nor substance,
Qualities nor causes -- only God I saw.
I opened mine eyes and by the light of His face around me
In all the eye discovered -- only God I saw.
Like a candle I was melting in His fireï¼š
Amidst the flames outflashing -- only God I saw.
Myself with mine own eyes I saw most clearly,
But when I looked with God's eyes -- only God I saw.
I passed away into nothingness, I vanished,
And lo, I was the All-living -- only God I saw.
