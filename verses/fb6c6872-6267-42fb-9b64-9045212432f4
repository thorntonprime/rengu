Title: The Way Love Is
---
You are love in everything
that is, and it belongs to

the perfection of Your greatness
that not even my nothingness

is far from You, for You
meet me in my imperfection

and You act on me not from
the distance of my failings

but from the presence
of Your perfection which

is the way love is.
