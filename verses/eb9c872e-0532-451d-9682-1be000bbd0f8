Title: Would It Not Be?
---
Many times I have been asked, What is it like to know the Truth?
And my answers have varied depending on who posed the question, but this
 one I have never quite said before,
and it is, To know the Truth is to be able to enjoy deeply anything, anything
 that can happen in this world.
For the one who knows the Truth knows all is perfect. But sometimes it is best
 I pretend as if it is not.  Some words come to mind about this, they areï¼š
There are wings that can applaud even the madness but to it never add one's
 own precious touch.
The seer can see any event as if it were the only event that has ever happened
 in creation, or will happen,
thus all appears miraculous, miraculous. Would it then not?
