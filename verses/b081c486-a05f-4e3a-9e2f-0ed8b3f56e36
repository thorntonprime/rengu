Beauty as beauty? Only with ugliness.
Goodness as goodness? Only with villainy.

Being and non-being arise as one.
Hard and easy,
long and short,
high and low,
text and voice,
before and after
gain meaning together.

A wise man works without ado,
and teaches by example merely.
He creates, not claiming it his own.
He works, not waiting for return.
With deeds complete, he sets no store by them.
When achievements are not owned, neither can they be lost.
