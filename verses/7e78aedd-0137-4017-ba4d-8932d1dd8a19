\"What's more, we go around telling each other, I do this, I do that -
but how do we know that this `I' we talk about has any `I' to it? You
dream you're a bird and soar up into the sky; you dream you're a fish
and dive down in the pool. But now when you tell me about it, I don't
know whether you are awake or whether you are dreaming. Running around
accusing others is not as good as laughing, and enjoying a good laugh
is not as good as going along with things. Be content to go along and
forget about change and then you can enter the mysterious oneness of
Heaven."
