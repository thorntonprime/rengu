When we preach the Dharma to those who see only the ego’s illusory world,
we preach in vain. We might as well preach to the dead.

How foolish are they who turn away from what is real and true and lasting
and instead pursue the fleeting shapes of the physical world, shapes that
are mere reflections in the ego’s mirror. Not caring to peer beneath the
surfaces, deluded beings are content to snatch at images. They think that
the material world’s ever-flowing energy can be modified into permanent
forms, that they can name and value these forms, and then, like great
lords, exert dominion over them.

Material things are like dead things and the ego cannot vivify them. As the
great lord is by his very identity attached to his kingdom, the ego, when
it attaches itself to material objects, presides over a realm of the dead.
The Dharma is for the living. The permanent cannot abide in the ephemeral.
True and lasting joy can’t be found in the ego’s world of changing
illusion. No one can drink the water of a mirage.
