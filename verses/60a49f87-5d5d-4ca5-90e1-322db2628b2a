Title: The Extraordinary Influence You Can Yield
---
At some point one's prayers will become so powerful that they can shake a full
  tree in an orchard in heaven and fruit will roll through the streets in this
  world.

But, dear, until you can do that, maybe apprentice yourself to someone who can,
  and they will help your destiny achieve the height of the extraordinary
  influence you can yield.
