The man of kingly Virtue moves in simplicity and is ashamed to be a
master of facts. He takes his stand in the original source and his
understanding extends to the spirits. Therefore his Virtue is
far-reaching. His mind moves forth only when some external thing has
roused it. Without the Way the body can have no life, and without
Virtue, life can have no clarity. To preserve the body and live out
life, to establish Virtue and make clear the Way - is this not kingly
Virtue? Broad and boundless, suddenly he emerges, abruptly he moves,
and the ten thousand things follow him - this is what is called the man
of kingly Virtue!
