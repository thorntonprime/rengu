There were others like Plato, a most excellent man, who maintained that there
are not only as many Intelligences as there are motions of the heavens, but
also as many as there are kinds of thingsï¼š such as one kind for all men,
another for gold, another for silver, and so on; and they say that as the
Intelligences are the generators of these (motions), each of its own, so these
other (Intelligences) are the generators of all other things, and the exemplars
each of their own kind; and Plato calls them Ideas, which is as much as to say
forms, and universal natures. The heathen called them gods and goddesses
(although they had not so philosophical an understanding of them as Plato had),
and adored their images, and built to them great temples.
