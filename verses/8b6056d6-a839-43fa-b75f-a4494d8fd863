Simplicius ... who had read Empedocles, acquaints us, that he made two
worlds, the one intellectual, the other sensible; and the former of
these to be the exemplar and archetype of the latter. And so the
writer De Placitis Philosophorum observes ... that Empedocles made 8vo
rjiovs, to v fièv àpxtTvirov.Tov 8¿ <f)aívó/j.evov, two suns, the one
archetypal and intelligible, the other apparent or sensible.
