Title: On America in the Sixties
---
Yesterday I dipped into the manuscript that Julian Miller at Harcourt,
Brace & World wanted me to comment on -- nuns used as whores by Viet Cong,
etc. The correct mythology, which assumes a compound of oversexuality, crude
violence, honest bourgeois privatism, native American honesty, a bit of
lesbianism for kicks. In other words, a pile of stupid shit. What revolted
me was not so much the sex as the attitude -- the mixture of superficial
objectivity and Time-Life self-righteousness -- and the suburb
sophistication. America as she sees herself. The kind of America that
makes Norman Mailer vomit -- and me too.

It always gets back to the same thing. I have dutifully done my bit. I have
been “open to the world.” That is to say, I have undergone my dose of
exposure to American society in the ’60s -- particularly in these last
weeks. I love the people I run into, but I pity them for having to live as
they do, and I think the world of USA, in 1967 is a world of crass, blind,
overstimulated, phony, lying stupidity. The war in Asia slowly gets worse --
and almost more inane. The temper of the country is one of blindness,
fat, self-satisfied, ruthless, mindless corruption. A lot of people are
uneasy about it but helpless to do anything against it. The rest are
perfectly content with the rat race as it is, and with its competitive,
acquisitive, hurtling, souped-up drive into nowhere. A massively aimless,
baseless, shrewd cockiness that simply exalts itself without purpose. The
mindless orgasm, in which there is no satisfaction, only spasm.
