A Jnani (knower of God) and a Premika (lover of God) were once passing
through a forest. On the way they saw a tiger at a distance. The Jnani
said. “There is no reason why we should flee： the Almighty God will
certainly protect us.' At this the Premika said. “No. brother, come,
let us run away. Why should we trouble the Lord for what can be
accomplished by our own exertions?'
