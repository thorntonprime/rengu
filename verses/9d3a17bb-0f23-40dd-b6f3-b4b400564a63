Commentary: |
  The whole of this poem conceals an eschatology which merits reflection.

  Shakespeare's work in general manifests a profound grasp of Hermetic
  doctrine (the Lesser Mysteries), and this explains his masterful alchemy
  with the human soul as the basic substance of his Art： it is the materia
  prima capable of being reduced from chaos into order. No more than Dante's
  are his productions to be mistaken for mere literature.
  Cf. Paul Arnold： Ésotérisme de Shakespeare, Paris, 1955.

That are either true or fair.
