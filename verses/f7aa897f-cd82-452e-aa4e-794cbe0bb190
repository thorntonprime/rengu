Title: These Candles, Our Bodies
---
These candles, our bodies, see how they burn.

How many hours will they last -- days, months, years?

Look at the warmth and comfort we can give to each other or to
anything that comes close.

One of the components of lasting art is a spirit flame within the
created

that can ignite inspiration and hope, and survive time's ways.
