Title: Constrained In Will
---
So it is said, Grief and happiness are perversions of Virtue; joy and
anger are transgressions of the Way; love and hate are offenses against
Virtue. When the mind is without care or joy, this is the height of
Virtue. When it is unified and unchanging, this is the height of
stillness. When it grates against nothing, this is the height of
emptiness. When it has no commerce with things, this is the height of
limpidity. When it rebels against nothing, this is the height of
purity.
