Rama, Krishna, Buddha, the great Rishis. Mahatmas and Saints point to the one
goal as the highest aim of life, viz., liberation and union with God. Human
life is solely intended for attaining this blessed state. The supreme Lord is
seated in the hearts of all beings and creatures. ... Verily, all the different
religions are so many paths that lead mankind to the one Universal God!
