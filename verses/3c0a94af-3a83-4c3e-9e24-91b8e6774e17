As Plato sometimes speaks of the divine love, it arises not out of indigency,
as created love does, but out of fulness and redundancy; it is an overflowing
fountain, and that love which descends upon created being is a free efflux from
the almighty source of love; and it is well pleasing to him that those
creatures which he hath made should partake of it.
