It’s easier to go from poverty to luxury than it is to go from luxury to
poverty. Everybody knows that. Poverty is like being tossed around in
troubled water. If a person is alert, he can find a way out. But luxury is
like drifting gently in a river current. He’ll fall asleep and won’t wake
up until he’s in the ocean. Welcome hardship. Regard rain as so much
morning dew. Be afraid of sunny days. It’s hard to climb with the blazing
sun on your back.
