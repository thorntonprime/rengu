There is no greater mystery than this -- viz, ourselves being the Reality we
seek to gain reality. We think that there is something hiding our Reality and
that it must be destroyed before the Reality is gained. It is ridiculous. A
day will dawn when you will yourself laugh at your past efforts. That which
will be on the day you laugh is also here and now.
