Title: An Ecology of Silence
---
The new bells sound wonderful from the woods.

St. John‘s day -- Frater Tarcisius and I walked all the way to Hanekamp‘s
in the afternoon. Wonderful, quiet little valley! The silent house, the goats
in the red sage grass, the dry creek, and Haneltamp's vineyard. The beautiful
silence of the woods on every side! Frater Tarcisius looked about with such
reverence that you would have thought he was seeing angels. Later we separated
to pray apart in the thinned pine grove on the southeastern hillside. And I
could see how simple it is to find God in solitude. There is no one else,
nothing else. He is all there is to find there. Everything is in Him. And
what could be more pleasing to Him than that we should leave all things
and all company to be with Him and think only of Him and know Him alone,
in order to give Him our love?

To be alone by being part of the universe- fitting in completely to an
environment of woods and silence and peace. Everything you do becomes a
unity and a prayer. Unity within and without. Unity with all living things-
without effort or contention. My silence is part of the whole world's silence
and builds the temple of God without the noise of hammers.
