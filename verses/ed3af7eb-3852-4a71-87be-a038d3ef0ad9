Once there were the heavens and the earth, there was the distinction between
upper and lower, and when the first enlightened king made a permanent state,
there was social organization (with their class distinctions). Two nobles
cannot serve each other, neither can two commoners set each other to work. This
is the mathematics of Heaven.
