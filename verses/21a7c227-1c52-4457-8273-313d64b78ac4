Thou shalt understand that it is a science most profitable, and
passing all other sciences, for to learn to die. For a man to know
that he shall die, that is common to all menï¼š as much as there is no
man that may ever live or he hath hope or trust thereof; but thou
shalt find full few that hath this cunning to learn to die. ... I
shall give thee mystery of this doctrine; the which shall profit thee
greatly to the beginning of ghostly health, and to a stable fundament
of all virtues.
