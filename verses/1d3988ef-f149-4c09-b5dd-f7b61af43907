What constitutes self-realisation of Noble Wisdom ... is not comparable to
the perceptions attained by the sense-mind, neither is it comparable to
the cognition of the discriminating and intellectual-mind. Both of these
presuppose a difference between self and not-self and the knowledge so
attained is characterised by individuality and generality. Self-realisation
is based on identity and oneness; there is nothing to be discriminated nor
predicated concerning it. But to enter into it the Bodhisattva must be free
from all presuppositions and attachments to things, ideas and selfness.
