Title: Zhaozhou's Big Heads
---
A monk asked Zhaozhou, "I have heard the Venerable has
intimately seen Nanquan; do you deny it?"

Zhou said. "The Zhou township produces big turnip heads."

The Zhou township produces big turnips.

The patchrobed monks under heaven grasp at principles

and only know the past self and the current self.

They struggle to distinguish the white swans and the black crows.

Robber! Robber!

The nostrils of the patchrobed monks have already gotten pinched.
