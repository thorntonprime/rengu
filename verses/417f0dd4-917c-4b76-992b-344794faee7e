  - Forgiveness
By: Ruth Hanna

Somehow weâ€™ve come to believe that forgiveness is hard, a conflict-ridden
challenge that we will have to fight to do. What a joke we play on
ourselves! The joke is that we are so slow in realizing that forgiveness is
anything but a heavy, difficult step to take. Instead, it's light-hearted,
joyful, simple, and, most of all, fun!
