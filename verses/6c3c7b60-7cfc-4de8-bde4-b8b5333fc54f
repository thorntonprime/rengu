The man who lives in the world, hearing of the devout recluse, or going past
the door of his hermitage, feels an impulse to the devout life, has recalled
to his mind what man can be upon earth, that it is possible for man to get
back to that primitive contemplative state in which he issued from the hands
of his Creator.
