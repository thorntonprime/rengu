You know, passion is necessary to understand truth -- I am using the word
passion in its full significance -- because to feel strongly, to feel deeply,
with all your being, is essential; otherwise that strange thing called
reality will never come to you. But your religions, your saints say that
you must not have desire, you must control, suppress, overcome, destroy,
which means that you come to truth burnt out, worn out, empty, dead. You
must have passion to meet this strange thing called life, and you cannot
have passion, intense feeling, if you are mesmerized by society, by custom,
if you are entangled in beliefs, dogmas, rituals. So to understand that light,
that truth, that immeasurable reality, we must first understand what we call
religion and be free of it-- not verbally, not intellectually, not through
explanations, but actually be free; because freedom -- not your intellectual
freedom but the actual state of freedom -- gives vitality. When you have
walked through all this rubbish, when you have put aside all these confusing,
traditional imitative things, then the mind is free, then the mind is alert,
then the mind is passionate. And it is only such a mind that can proceed.
