March is St. Benedict's month. Clearing thorn trees from the rocky shoulder
over the middle bottom, where the new road is being made. I got to be good
friends with his relic yesterday. How weary I am of being a writer. How
necessary it is for monks to work in the fields, in the rain, in the sun,
in the mud, in the clay, in the windï¼š these are our spiritual directors
and our novice masters. They form our contemplation. They instill virtue
in us. They make us stable as the land we live in.You do not get that out
of a typewriter.

  For then are they truly monks: when they live by the
  labor of their hands, as our Fathers and the Apostles did.
