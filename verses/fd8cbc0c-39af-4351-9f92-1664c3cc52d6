Here, where I've come to perch,
are many deep, mysterious places
men seldom speak of.
No wind, and yet the vines sway;
No mist, but the bamboo groves
seem somehow always dusky.
Who is it that the stream sobs for,
or for whom do the mountain's clouds stand
suddenly like pennants at attention?
At noon, when I meditate inside my tent,
I find the sun on my horizon.
