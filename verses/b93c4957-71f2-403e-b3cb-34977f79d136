Three days before the time set for the execution. Felicitas gave birth to a
child. She suffered intense pain, which she could not hide from the rude
soldiers on guard.

‘If you lament and cry out now.' one of them said to her. "What will you do
when you are thrown to the wild beasts?'

will be with me. who will suffer for me. because 1 will suffer for Him.'
