From this we may see that the world has lost the Way, and the Way has
lost the world; the world and the Way have lost each other. What means
does a man of the Way have to go forward in the world? What means does
the world have to go forward in the Way? The Way cannot go forward in
the world, and the world cannot go forward in the Way. So, although the
sage does not retire to dwell in the midst of the mountain forest, his
Virtue is already hidden. It is already hidden, and therefore he does
not need to hide it himself.
