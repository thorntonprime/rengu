Magu holding his ring-staff arrived at
Zhangjing and went around the meditation bench three full circles,
shook the ring-staff once and next stood there stately.

Jing said, "Correct, correct."

Xuedou attached words saying, "Mistaken."

Magu in addition arrived at Nanquan and went around the
meditation bench three full circles, shook the ring-staff once, and
next stood there stately.

Quan said, "Incorrect, incorrect."

Xuedou attached words saying, "Mistaken."

Magu, rich in opportunity, said, "Zhangjing said,
'Correct', Venerable, why did you say, 'Incorrect'?"

Quan said, "Zhangjing immediately was correct; you were
incorrect. Here is a strong wind turning about in place, in the end it
is defeated and destroyed."
