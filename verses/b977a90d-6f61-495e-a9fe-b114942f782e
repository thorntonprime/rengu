If God keeps the ego in a man, then He keeps in him the sense of
differentiation and also the sense of virtue and sin. But in a rare few
He completely effaces the ego, and these go beyond virtue and sin, good
and bad. As long as a man has not realized God, he retains the sense of
differentiation and the knowledge of good and bad.
