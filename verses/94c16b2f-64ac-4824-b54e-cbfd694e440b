With anarchy, people are ever so honest.
With bureaucracy, people are ever so cunning.

Good fortune on misfortune rides.
Misfortune in good fortune hides.

Who can guide himself without a compass?
Standards become extraneous.
Virtue becomes vicious.

How long have men been deluded
while integrity eludes them!

Be square but not pointed,
sharp but not cutting,
straight but not intrusive,
bright but not glaring.
