  - Discernment-Truth=Knowledge=The Excellence of Wisdom
  - Discernment-Truth=The Eye Of Eternity-Supreme Center=The Supernal Sun

The eye of Knowledge contemplates Brahma as It is in Itself, abounding in
Bliss, pervading all things; but the eye of ignorance discovers It not.
discerns It not. even as a blind man perceives not the sensible light. ...

When the Sun of spiritual Knowledge rises in the heavens of the heart, it
dispels the darkness, it pervades all. envelopes all and illumines all.
