Title: Looking Far
Commentary: |
  We tend to expect great things from “seeing the world” and “getting
  experience.” A Roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but
  not their soul. Other poets, untraveled and inexperienced, Emily Brontë
  and Emily Dickinson, prove Lao Tzu’s point： it’s the inner eye that
  really sees the world.

You don’t have to go out the door
to know what goes on in the world.
You don’t have to look out the window
to see the way of heaven.
The farther you go,
the less you know.

So the wise soul
doesn’t go, but knows;
doesn’t look, but sees;
doesn’t do, but gets it done.
