Commentary: |
  Over and over Lao Tzu says wei wu wei： Do not do. Doing not-doing. To act
  without acting. Action by inaction. You do nothing yet it gets done. ...
  It’s not a statement susceptible to logical interpretation, or even to a
  syntactical translation into English; but it’s a concept that transforms
  thought radically, that changes minds. The whole book is both an explanation
  and a demonstration of it.

Not praising the praiseworthy
keeps people uncompetitive.

Not prizing rare treasures
keeps people from stealing.

Not looking at the desirable
keeps the mind quiet.

So the wise soul
governing people
would empty their minds,
fill their bellies,
weaken their wishes,
strengthen their bones,

keep people unknowing,
unwanting,
keep the ones who do know
from doing anything.

When you do not-doing,
nothing’s out of order.
