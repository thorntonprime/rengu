Mountains, rivers and the earth itself are parts of The One. The clear mind
is transparent; all existence can be seen through it. The mind clouded by
illusion of ego sees nothing but itself.

Strive to realize that you are included in The One! Your body may dwell in
the material world, but your mind will understand that there is nothing
apart from itself that it can desire.
