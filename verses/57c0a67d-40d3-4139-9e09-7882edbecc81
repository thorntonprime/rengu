The kingdom (Law) of the Buddha is not far away, but within us; eternal
truth (Shinnyo) can not be seen outside ourselves. Search, and you will
find it. Believe, and you will soon be free from illusion. Practise, and
you will at once realize the truth. Alas! for the foolish who deny this
certainty! Woe to them who are too ‘drunken and mad’ to listen to the
living sermon of nature!
