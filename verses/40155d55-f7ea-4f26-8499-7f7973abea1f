There are men who, with clear perceptions, as they think, of their own
duty, do not see how too eager a pursuit of one’s duty may involve them
in the violation of others, or how too warm an embracement of one truth may
lead to a disregard of other truths just as important, As I heard it stated
strongly, not many days ago, these persons are disposed to mount upon some
particular duty, as upon a war horse, and to drive furiously on and upon
and over all other duties that may stand in the way, These are men who,
in reference to disputes of that sort, are of the opinion that human duties
may be ascertained with the exactness of mathematics, They deal with morals
as with mathematics; and they think what is right may be distinguished
from what is wrong with the precision of an algebraic equation, They have,
therefore, none too much charity toward others who differ with them, They
are apt, too, to think that nothing is good but what is perfect, and that
there are no compromises or modifications to be made in consideration of
difference of opinion or in deference to other men’s judgment, If their
perspicacious vision enables them to detect a spot on the face of the sun,
they think that a good reason why the sun should be struck down from heaven,
They prefer the chance of running into utter darkness to living in heavenly
light, if that heavenly light be not absolutely without any imperfection.
