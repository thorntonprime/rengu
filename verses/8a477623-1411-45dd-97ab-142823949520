Unless your mind is pure, that is, free from all desires, you cannot
attain oneness with Him. Mere saying you are He, won’t do. Genuine
experience is necessary. Remaining always on the dual plane, subject
to the Dwandwas of pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour, profit and
loss, and still saying ‘I am Brahman’ or ‘I am one with the Divine’ is
self-deception.
