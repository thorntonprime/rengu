There can be nothing greater in existence than the simple, absolute
maximum. ... It is above all that we can conceive, for its nature excludes
degrees of ‘more’ and ‘less’. ... Being all that it can be, it is,
for one and the same reason, as great as it can be and as small as it can
be. By definition the minimum is that which cannot be less than it is; and
since that is also true of the maximum, it is evident that the minimum is
identified with the maximum.
