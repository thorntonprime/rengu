Title: Your Sight Embracing All
---
I sometimes watch the movement in an egg, in a nest on a cliff no one has
 ever neared, in a world that has not even been named.
The purity of all, its wonder, and your sight embracing everything, how
 could that ever be? Some kind of real omniscience?
You will never be able to work that extraordinary piece of the puzzle into
 your ken
believing so strongly in-and even being such an advocate at times ... of
 right and wrong, as you probably are.
