Fear God, and men will fear thee, though they be stronger and mightier
than thou. For when thou opposest them with the strength of thy fear
of God, they in their terror will tremble in their hearts like women;
while the sense of confidence, security, and tranquility will suffer
thee to draw thy foot out of the snare of the fowler.
