Title: Monk's Staff
By: Seisetsu Shucho
Commentary: |
  The staff is a frequent subject in Zen painting, here powerfully rendered
  on a slight diagonal by the early nineteenth century master Seisetsu
  Shucho. After a series ofcircular forms for the top ofthe staff, he moved his
  brush rapidly and strongly downward, creating “flying white” where the
  hairs ofthe brush ran dry on one side. The compositional diagonal leaves a
  perfect space for the inscription, brushed in fluent cursive script requiring
  only five total strokes of the brush. “Mushin” refers to “no mind.”
  and the final two words literally read “this mountain" (是山) but since
  every temple is considered to exist on a mountain. Seisetsu is referring
  to the place where Zen students are studying, which is always right here.
