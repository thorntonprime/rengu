Title: A Poem in a Letter
---
Before death takes away what you are given,
give away what is there to give.

No dead person grieves for his death. He mourns only what
he didn't do. Why did I wait? Why did I not ... ? Why did I
neglect to ... ?

I cannot think of better advice to send. I hope you like it.
May you stay in your infinity.

Peace.
