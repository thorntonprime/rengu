Daowu and Jianyuan arived to share condolences with one family.

Yuan patted the coffin and said, "Is alive the mistaken view or dead
the mistaken view?"

Wu said "Either alive don't say, or dead don't say."

Yuan said, "Why don't say?"

Wu said, "Don't say, don't say."

On the road in the middle of the return trip, Yuan said, "Venerable, be
straightforward with me and begin to say. If Wu doesn't say, then I'll
hit the venerable and go away too.

Wu said, "If you hit, of course I'll allow the hit. To say, of course,
don't say."

Yuan then hit.

Later Daowu moved into transformation (i.e., he died). Yuan went to
Shishuang and brought up the previous conversation. Shuang said,
"Either alive don't say, or dead don't say."

Yuan said, "Why don't say?"

Shuang said, "Don't say. Don't say."

As these words fell, Yuan had insight.

One day, Yuan went up to the dharma hall with a shovel. and from the
east [he] went across to the west, and from the west [he] went across
to the east.

Shuang said, "Wat are you doing?"

Yuan said, "[I'm] seeking [our] prior master's spirit-bone relics.

Shuang said, "Flooding waves vast and unbounded, the white billows
overflow the sky -- [you're] seeking what spirit-bone relics of [our]
prior master?"

Xuedou's attached words said, "Blue skies, blue skies."

Yuan said, "A just right show of power"

Tai Yuan Fu said, "It seems the prior master's spirit-bone relics are
present."
