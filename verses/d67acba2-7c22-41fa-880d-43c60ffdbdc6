Maiden! thou shalt dance merrily
Even as mine elect!

  THE SOUL
I cannot dance O Lord, unless Thou lead me.
If Thou wilt that I leap joyfully
Then must Thou Thyself first dance and sing!
  Then will I leap for love
From love to knowledge.
From knowledge to fruition,
From fruition to beyond all human sense.
There will I remain
And circle evermore.
