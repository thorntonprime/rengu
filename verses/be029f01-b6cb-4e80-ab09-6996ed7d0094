There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an
observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,

Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a
necromancer.

For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lordï¼š and
because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out
from before thee.
