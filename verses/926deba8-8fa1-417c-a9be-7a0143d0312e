Full near I came unto where dwelleth
  Laila, when I heard her call.
That voice is sweet beyond compare.
  I would that it might never cease.
She favoured me and drew me to her.
  took me in, into her precinct.
With discourse intimate addressed me.
  sat me face to face with her.
Closer drew herself towards me,
  raised the cloak that hid her from me,
Made me marvel to distraction.
  bewildered me with all her beauty.
She took me and amazed me,
  and hid me in her inmost self.
Until I thought that she was I,
  and my life she took as ransom.
