A Soul becomes uglyâ€”by something foisted upon it, by sinking itself into the
alien, by a fall, a descent into body, into Matter. The dishonour of the Soul
is in its ceasing to be clean and apart. Gold is degraded when it is mixed
with earthy particles; if these be worked out, the gold is left and is
beautiful, isolated from all that is foreign, gold with gold alone. And so
the Soul; let it be but cleared of the desires that come by its too intimate
converse with the body, emancipated from all the passions, purged of all
that embodiment has thrust upon it, withdrawn, a solitary, to itself again --
in that moment the ugliness that came only from the alien is stripped away.
