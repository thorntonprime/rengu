Tao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name.
Nameless： the origin of heaven and earth. Naming： the mother of ten
 thousand things.
Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive
 manifestations.
These have the same source, but different names.
Call them both deep - Deep and again deep： the gateway to all mystery.
