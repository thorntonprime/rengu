Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
things.

Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves：

Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the
creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections： for even their
women did change the natural use into that which is against nature：

And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that
which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of
their error which was meet.
