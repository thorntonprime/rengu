The thief Heedlessness, waiting to escape the eye of remembrance, robs
men of the righteousness they have gathered, and they come to an evil
lot. The Passions, a band of robbers, seek a lodging, and when they
have found it they rob us and destroy our good estate of life. Then
let remembrance never withdraw from the portal of the spirit; and if
it depart, let it be brought back by remembering the anguish of hell.
