Title: In Solitude for Everybody's Salvation
---
In the last analysis, what I am looking for in solitude is not happiness or
fulfillment but salvation. Not “my own” salvation, but the salvation of
everybody. And here is where the game gets serious. I have used the word
revolt in connection with solitude. Revolt against what? Against a notion
of salvation that gets people lost. A notion of salvation that is entirely
legal and extrinsic and can be achieved no matter how false, no matter how
shriveled and fruitless one’s inner life really is. This is the worst
ambiguity： the impression that one can be grossly unfaithful to life,
to experience, to love, to other people, to one’s own deepest self,
and yet be “saved” by an act of stubborn conformity, by the will to
be correct. In the end, this seems to me to be fatally like the very act
by which one is lost： the determination to be “right” at all costs,
by dint of hardening one’s core around an arbitrary choice of a fixed
position. To close in on one’s central wrongness with the refusal to
adrm't that it might be wrongThat is one of the reasons why solitude is
a dangerous thing： one may use it for that purpose. I don’t think I
can. I am not that stubborn. I am here in solitude for one thing： to
be open, to not be “closed in” on any one choice to the exclusion
of all others： to be open to God’s will and freedom, to His love,
which comes to save me from all in myself that resists Him and says no
to Him. This I must do not to justify myself, not to be right, not to be
good, but because the whole world of lost people needs this opening by
which salvation can get into it through me.
