Parrots live in the Western Lands;
forest huntsmen net them, bring them here.
Courtesans love to play with them, and so
they are well known at Court, in and out all day.
They're given golden cages to dwell in,
but bolted in, their robes of plumes are ruined.
Better a swan, or a crane ...
riding the winds high up, well known
to the clouds where they fly.
