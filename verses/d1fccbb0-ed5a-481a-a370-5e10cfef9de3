\"And suppose he is the kind who actually delights in worthy men and
hates the unworthy-then why does he need you to try to make him any
different? You had best keep your advice to yourself! Kings and dukes
always lord it over others and fight to win the argument. You will find
your eyes growing dazed, your color changing, your mouth working to
invent excuses, your attitude becoming more and more humble, until in
your mind you end by supporting him. This is to pile fire on fire, to
add water to water, and is called 'increasing the excessive.' If you
give in at the beginning, there is no place to stop. Since your fervent
advice is almost certain not to be believed, you are bound to die if
you come into the presence of a tyrant.
