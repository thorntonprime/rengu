      The day when the King of Israel, the King of the House of David, puts
      on his head the crown offered by Europe, he will become the Patriarch
      of the World. The number of victims sacrificed to hasten his coming
      will never amount to the number of those immolated over the centuries
      to the megalomaniac rivalry of the Goyim governments.

    Notes: Included here only for completeness with the source. The
      so-called 'Protocols' are widely regarded to be anti-Semitic
      propoganda, and shouldn't be considered a primary religious
      text.
