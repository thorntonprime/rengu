Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
The Virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and earth as its
ancestor, the Way and its Virtue as its master, inaction as its
constant rule. With inaction, you may make the world work for you and
have leisure to spare; with action, you will find yourself working for
the world and never will it be enough. Therefore the men of old prized
inaction.
