Title: Ever Shining Light
---
Some days it seems the whole world
is tilting the wrong wayï¼š it might be up

but I am somehow down, and right is
always somewhere else against my

wrong, and then You remind me that
within me burns an ever shining light

which no night or stumbling down
can ever fully dim or finally smite.
