The WORLD is not this little Cottage of Heaven and Earth. Though this be fair,
it is too small a Gift. When God made the World He made the Heavens, and the
Heavens of Heavens, and the Angels, and the Celestial Powers. These also
are parts of the Worldï¼š So are all those infinite and eternal Treasures
that are to abide for ever, after the Day of Judgment. Neither are these,
some here, and some there, but all everywhere, and at once to be enjoyed.
