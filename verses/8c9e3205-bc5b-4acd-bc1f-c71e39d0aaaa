By: St Augustine
---
Thy desire is thy prayer; and if thy desire is without ceasing, thy prayer
will also be without ceasing. ... There is interior prayer without ceasing,
and this is your desire. Whatever else you do, if you do but long for that
sabbath, you do not cease to pray. If you would never cease to pray, never
cease to long after it. The continuance of your longing is the continuance
of your prayer.
