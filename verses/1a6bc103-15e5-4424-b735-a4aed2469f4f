NIEH CH'UEH WAS QUESTIONING Wang Ni. Four times he asked a question and
four times Wang Ni said he didn't know. Nieh Ch'ueh proceeded to hop
around in great glee and went and told Master P'u-i. Master P'u-i said,
"Are you just now finding that out?  The clansman Yu-yu was no match
for the clansman T'ai. The clansman Yu-yu still held on to benevolence
and worked to win men over. He won men over all right, but he never got
out into [the realm of] 'notman.' The clansman T'ai, now - he lay down
peaceful and easy; he woke up wide-eyed and blank. Sometimes he thought
he was a horse; sometimes he thought he was a cow. His understanding
was truly trustworthy; his virtue was perfectly true. He never entered
[the realm of] 'not-man.' "
