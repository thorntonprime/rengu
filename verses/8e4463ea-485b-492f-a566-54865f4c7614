And a command has gone forth from the presence of the Lord concerning
those who dwell on the earth that their ruin is accomplished because
they have learnt all the secrets of the angels, and all the violence
of the Satans, and all their powers -- the most secret ones -- and all
the power of those who practise sorcery, and the power of witchcraft,
and the power of those who make molten images for the whole earthï¼š And
how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how soft metal
originates in the earth.
