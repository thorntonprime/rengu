Title: A Legitimate Question & Feeling Compelled
---
What do lovers do after their bodies have performed all the little
magic that they can,

after the enchantment of limb-caressing love created such a force and
shelter of protection

the world was held at bay for precious moments, and the future and the
past waited as it always does outside a seer's house, humbly,

in some shed out back where the garden tools are kept, and then lifted
by the real teacher if ever she or he desires

to plant something in time's meadow that can benefit generations?

Hey, that looks like one sentence up north. I rarely write like that
knowing most have a short attention span, and may feel compelled to
check some message.

That long sentence looks too windy to proofread and it might have
gotten more cerebral than I intended and or esoteric. In short, good
luck in contemplating that one ... if you try.

Nevertheless, I think I pose a legitimate question ... about lovers
passing time, and magic tools you have in a shed.
