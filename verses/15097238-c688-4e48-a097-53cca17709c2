Title: Useful Emptiness
Commentary: |
  The “inhumanity” of the wise soul doesn’t mean cruelty. Cruelty is
  a human characteristic. Heaven and earth -- that is, “Nature” and its
  Way -- are not humane, because they are not human. They are not kind; they
  are not cruel： those are human attributes. You can only be kind or cruel
  if you have, and cherish, a self. You can’t even be indifferent if you
  aren’t different. Altruism is the other side of egoism. Followers of the
  Way, like the forces of nature, act selflessly.

Heaven and earth aren’t humane.
To them the ten thousand things
are straw dogs.

Wise souls aren’t humane.
To them the hundred families
are straw dogs.

Heaven and earth
act as a bellows：

Empty yet structured,
it moves, inexhaustibly giving.
