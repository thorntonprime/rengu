What is our life? a play of passion,
Our mirth the musicke of. division.
Our mothers wombes the tyring houses be.
Where we are drest for this short Comedy,
Heaven the Judicious sharpe spectator is.
That sits and markes still who doth act amisse.
Our graves that hide us from the searching Sun,
Are like drawne curtaynes when the play is done.
Thus march we playing to our latest rest,
Onely we dye in earnest, thatâ€™s no Jest.
