Prajñá (transcendent wisdom) remains immovable, though this does not mean the
immovability or insensibility of such objects as a piece of wood or rock. It is
the mind itself endowed with infinite motivities： it moves forward and
backward, to the left and to the right, to every one of the ten quarters, and
knows no hindrances in any direction. Prajñá Immovable is this mind capable of
infinite movements.
