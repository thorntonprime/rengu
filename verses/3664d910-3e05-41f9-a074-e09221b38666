Some people were conversing about the future life, some saying that
fish-eaters will be born into the Pure Land, others that they will not. Hônen
overhearing them said, ‘If it is a case of eating fish, cormorants would be
bom into the Pure Land： and if it is a case of not eating them, monkeys
would be so born. But I am sure that whether a man eats fish or not, if he
only calls upon the sacred name, he will be born into the Pure Land.’
