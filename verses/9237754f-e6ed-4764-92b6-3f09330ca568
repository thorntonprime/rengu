Now, the landscape of this region called Valais is indescribable. Why
isn't it named when people count up the wonders of the world? At first I
did not really see it, because I was comparing it in my mind with the most
meaningful of my memoriesï¼š with Spain, with Provence (to which, in reality,
thanks to the Rhone, it is a blood relative). But now that I have learned to
behold it fully on its own terms, it reveals its true dimensions to me, and
I come more and more to recognize the sweetness of its character and sense
the most urgent of its messages... Perhaps that is reflected in a strange,
inexpressible fear that I might die somewhere else before I have grasped
this and taken it into myself.
