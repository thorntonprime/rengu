Man is the microcosm in the strictest sense of the word. He is the summary of
all existence. There is no creature that is not recapitulated in man. There
is nothing in the universe lower than body or higher than soul.

Soul and (the spiritual) body were created together, and the soul therefore
precedes the body only in dignity, not in space or in time. But the body
as we know it, material and corruptible, came into existence after manâ€™s
sin, and because of it. It was man, after he had transgressed, who made to
himself this fragile and mortal body. This is signified by the fig leaves,
which are a shade, excluding the rays of the sun, as our bodies shade our
souls in the darkness of ignorance, and exclude the light of truth.

But where, then, is that spiritual and incorruptible body which belonged
to man before his sin? It is hidden in the secret recesses of our nature,
and it will reappear in the future, when this mortal shall put on immortality.
