Title: Thousands Enter Your Court
---
Most live in a constant state of comparison. Thousands enter your court each
 day, where you judge.
How many things though get your personal attention to the extent you might
 speak to them or place your hand against their body?
Names and forms are drowning before me. Sugar and salt blocks were all things,
 dissolving now in the Ocean of Light.
Someone calls out for help in the dark, wanting to remain the limited,
 wanting to keep the
nightmare intact ... what should I do, when a door is now open to return to
 your self?
