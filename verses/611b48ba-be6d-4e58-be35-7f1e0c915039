Slow for the sake of flowers as they turn
  Toward sunlight, graceful as a line of sail
    Coming into the wind. Slow for the mill --
Wheel's heft and plummet, for the chug and churn
  Of water as it gathers, for the frail
    Half-life of spraylets as they toss and spill.

For all that lags and eases, all that shows
  The winding-downward and diminished scale
    Of days declining to a twilit chill,
Breathe quietly, release into reposeï¼š
    Be still.
