Favor and disgrace are things that startle;
High rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble.

What is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle?
Favor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it
 is withdrawn.
This is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that
 startle.
What is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of
 great trouble?
The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?

Hence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be
 entrusted with the empire.
He who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the
 custody of the empire.
