Title: An Apple Tree Was Concerned
---
An apple tree told me it was concerned about a late frost and losing
its gift that would help feed a poor family close by.

And then there were the jams and lots of apple butter that could be
made in a banner crop year

when the clouds were generous with what fell from them and the sun
rationed itself with precision.

They can speak, trees, they can say the sweetest things, and can even
tell a joke,

but it takes special ears to hear them, ears that have listened to
people ... with great care.
