The Source, having no prior, cannot be contained by any other form of being; It
is orbed around all; possessing, but not possessed, holding all, Itself nowhere
held. It is omnipresent; at the same time. It is not present, not being
circumscribed by anything; yet, as utterly unattached, not inhibited from
presence at any point.
