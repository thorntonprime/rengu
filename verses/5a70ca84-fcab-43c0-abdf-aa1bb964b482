Maistryefull merveylous and Archimastrye
Is the tincture of holi Alkimy：
A wonderfull Science, secrete Philosophie,
A singular grace & gifte of th’almightie：
Which never was founde by labour of Mann.
But it by Teaching, or Revelación begann.
It was never for Mony sold ne bought.
By any Man which for it hath sought：
But given to an able Man by grace.
Wrought with greate Cost, with long laysir and space.
