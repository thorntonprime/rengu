I say, that of all idiocies, that is the most stupid, most vile, and
most damnable which holds that after this life there is none other;
because, if we look through all the writings of the philosophers, as
well as of the other wise authors, they all agree in this, that there
is some part of us which is immortal. ... And this seems to be the
meaning of all law, whether of Jews, Saracens, or Tartars, or any
others who live at all according to law. For that all deceived
themselves, were an impossibility, horrible even to mention Again, it
is confirmed by the most veracious teaching of Christ, which is the
Way, the Truth, and the Light.
