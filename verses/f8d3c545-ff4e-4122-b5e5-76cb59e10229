The objects of the material world are the props, sets and characters of a
dream-drama. When one awakens, the stage vanishes. The players and the
audience too, disappear. Waking up is not death. What lives in a dream can
die in a dream; but the dreamer has a real existence that doesnâ€™t perish
with the dream. All that is necessary for him to stop dreaming, to cease
being fascinated by dream images, and to realize that he has merely been a
dreamer.
