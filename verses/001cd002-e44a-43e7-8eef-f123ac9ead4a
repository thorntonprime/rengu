Title: Before Eating
---
The Buddha advises us to be mindful while we eat, to be in touch with the
Sangha and the food. Brothers and sisters, when you hear the bell, meditate
on the Five Contemplationsï¼š This food is the gift of the whole universe;
the earth, the sky, and much hard work. May we be worthy to receive it. May
we transform unskillful states of mind, especially the habit of eating
without moderation. May we take only foods that nourish us and prevent
illness. We accept this food to realize the path of understanding and love.
