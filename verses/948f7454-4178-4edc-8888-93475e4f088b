When Tzu-kung got back to Lu, he reported the incident to Confucius.
Confucius said, "He is one of those bogus practitioners of the arts of
Mr. Chaos." He knows the first thing but doesn't understand the second.
He looks after what is on the inside but doesn't look after what is on
the outside. A man of true brightness and purity who can enter into
simplicity, who can return to the primitive through inaction, give body
to his inborn nature, and embrace his spirit, and in this way wander
through the everyday world - if you had met one like that, you would
have had real cause for astonishment. As for the arts of Mr. Chaos,
you and I need not bother to find out about them."
