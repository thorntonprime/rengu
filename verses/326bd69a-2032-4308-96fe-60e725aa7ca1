Commentary: Once again we encounter the symbolism of the vertical axis, or
  World Tree, attached to the "Ship of Life", whose deck corresponds to the
  ‘Surface of the Waters’, q.v. Cf. Coomaraswamy： ‘The Symbolism of the Dome’,
  Indian Historical Quarterly, Calcutta, March, 1938.

exhausted crow far from land hath confidence in the mast of the ship upon which
it resteth.
