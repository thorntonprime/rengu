Use the unexpected to govern the country, Use surprise to wage war, Use
 non-action to win the world. How do I know? Like this!
The more prohibitions and rules, The poorer people become. The sharper
 people's weapons, The more they riot.
The more skilled their techniques, The more grotesque their works. The more
 elaborate the laws, The more they commit crimes.
Therefore the Sage says, I do nothing And people transform themselves. I
 enjoy serenity And people govern themselves.
I cultivate emptiness And people become prosperous. I have no desires And
 people simplify themselves.
