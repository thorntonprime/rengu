Athens hath produced many excellent, even divine inventions and
applied them to the use of life, but she has given nothing better than
those Mysteries by which we are drawn from an irrational and savage
life and tamed, as it were, and broken to humanity. They are truly
called Initia, for they are indeed the beginnings of a life of reason
and virtue.
