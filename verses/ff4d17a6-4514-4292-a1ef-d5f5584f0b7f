Title: God Is the Room I Rest In
---
God's love takes care of everything I do. He guides me in all my work and
in my reading, at least until I get greedy and start rushing from page to
page. It is really illogical that I should get temptations to run off to
another monastery and to another Order of monks. God has put me in a place
where I can spend hour after hour, each day, in occupations that are always
on the borderline of prayer. There is always a chance to step over the line
and enter into simple and contemplative union with God. I get plenty of
time alone before the Blessed Sacrament, I have gotten into the habit of
walking up and down under the trees, or along the way of the cemetery, in
the presence of God. And yet I am such a fool that I can consent to imagine
that in some other situation I would quickly advance to a high degree of
prayer. If I went anywhere else, I would almost certainly be much worse
off than here. And, anyway, I did not come to Gethsemani for myself but
for God. God is my order and my cell. He is my religious life and my rule.
He has disposed everything in my life in order to draw me inward, where I
can see Him and rest in Him. He has put me in this place because He wants
me in this place, and ifHe ever wants to put me anywhere else. He will do
so in a way that will leave no doubt as to who is doing it.
