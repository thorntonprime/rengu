If it was a matter of having to see or hear something in China or India,
far beyond the seven fold tides of the seas, one might grieve. But what we
are trying to do, is to look at our own mind with our own mind -- and that
is something closer to us than looking at the pupils of our eyes with our
eyes. And do not grieve as if it were something very deep that we are trying
to look at. If it were a matter of something to be seen or listened to at
the bottom of the nine fold chasm or under the thousand-fathomed depths of
the sea we might grieve -- but to look at my own heart with my own heart is
less than smelling my own nose with my own nostrils!
