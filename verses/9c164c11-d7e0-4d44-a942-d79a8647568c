Of the various kinds of penances in the form of action or austerity, the
constant remembrance of Krishna is the best.

The singing of His name is the best means for the dissolution of various sins,
as fire is the best dissolver of metals.

The most heinous sins of men disappear immediately if they remember the Lord
even for a moment.
