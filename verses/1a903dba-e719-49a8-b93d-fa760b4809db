If any one ... should have his terrestrial body exempt from him, and his
luminous and celestial vehicle and the senses which it contains purified,
either through a good allotment, or through probity of life, or through a
perfection arising from sacred operations, such a one will perceive things
invisible to others, and will hear things inaudible by others. With respect to
divine and immaterial bodies, however, if any sound is produced by them, it is
neither percussive nor destructive, but it excites the powers and energies of
sublunary sounds, and perfects the sense which is co-ordinate with them.
