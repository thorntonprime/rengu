If we have failed to understand, it is that we have thought of knowledge as a
mass of theorems and an accumulation of propositions. But this is not a wisdom
built up of theorems but one totality, not manifold detail reduced to a unity,
but rather a unity working out into detail.

The true Wisdom, then, is Real Being, and Real Being is Wisdom.
