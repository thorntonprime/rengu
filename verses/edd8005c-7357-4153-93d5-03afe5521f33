The real orchards and fruits are within the heart： the reflexion of their
beauty is falling upon this water and earth (the external world).

If it were not the reflexion of that delectable cypress (the heart of the
saint), then God would not have called it the abode of deception.

This deception consists in that： i.e. this phantom (the external world)
derives its existence from the reflexion of the heart and spirit of the holy
men.

All the deceived ones come to gaze on this reflexion in the opinion that this
is the place of Paradise.

They are fleeing from the origins of the orchards： they are making merry over
a phantom.
