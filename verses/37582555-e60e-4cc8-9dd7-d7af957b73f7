Jo of the North Sea said, "He who understands the Way is certain to
have command of basic principles. He who has command of basic
principles is certain to know how to deal with circumstances. And, he
who knows how to deal with circumstances will not allow things to do
him harm. When a man has perfect virtue, fire cannot burn him, water
cannot drown him, cold and heat cannot afflict him, birds and beasts
cannot injure him. I do not say that he makes light of these things. I
mean that he distinguishes between safety and danger, contents himself
with fortune or misfortune, and is cautious in his comings and goings.
Therefore nothing can harm him.
