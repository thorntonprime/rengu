Title: We Add to Ourselves or Detract
Description: July 29
---
Every time you open your mouth and let a sound out, you alert the prey. And
 who is not hunting because of some hunger?
What you seek may run in different ways. Or people you know may begin to
 snarl within when they see you coming.
We add to ourselves or detract whenever we speak. Our words turn into an
 entity and a magnetic field someone has to reckon with.
I have found it is best to be on good terms with as much as one can --
 controlling the notes from the flute, from the body, that can rise.
Yes, we add to ourselves or detract, in some ways, with each movement. I
 have increased my worth so much, a treasury I have become, I hope you loot.
