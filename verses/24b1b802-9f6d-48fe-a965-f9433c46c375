All whom Moses calls wise are represented as sojourners. Their souls
are never colonists leaving heaven for a new home. Their way is to
visit earthly nature as men who travel abroad to see and learn. So
when they have stayed awhile in their bodies, and beheld through them
all that sense and mortality has to show, they make their way back to
the place from which they set out at first. To them the heavenly
region, where their citizenship lies, is their native landï¼š the
earthly region in which they became sojourners is a foreign country.
