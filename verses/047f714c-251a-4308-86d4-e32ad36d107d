Confucius said, "Make your will one! Don't listen with your ears,
listen with your mind. No, don't listen with your mind, but listen with
your spirit. Listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with
recognition, but spirit is empty- and waits on all things. The Way
gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."
