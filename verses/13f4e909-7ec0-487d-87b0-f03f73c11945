The disciples then inquired if they could engage in worldly duties, in
a small way, for the benefit of others, and Jetsun said, ‘If there be
not the least self-interest attached to such duties, it is
permissible. But such (detachment) is indeed rare; and works performed
for the good of others seldom succeed if not wholly freed from
self-interest.  Even without seeking to benefit others, it is with
difficulty that works done even in one’s own interest (or selfishly)
are successful. It is as if a man helplessly drowning were to try to
save another man in the same predicament. One should not be
over-anxious and hasty in setting out to serve others before one hath
oneself realized Truth in its fullness; to be so, would be like the
blind leading the blind.’
