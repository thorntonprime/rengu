A monk asked Master Zhaozhou, “Does a dog have buddha nature or not?”
Zhaozhou said, “mu!” (No). Because it is understood in Buddhist circles
that all things, sentient and insentient alike, have the buddha nature,
the great Master Zhaozhou's response, “mu!” presents a difficult
barrier. Zen Master Wumen once said：

  The dog, the buddha nature!
  The truth is manifested in full.
  A moment of yes and no;
  Lost are your body and soul.

Aside from Zen Master Soen's signature, we are left with nothing but the
character mu. What more can be said? When we have forgotten the self,
it fills the whole universe
