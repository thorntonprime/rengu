---
I have been in many shapes before I attained a congenial form; ...
There is nothing in which I have not been.

I was with my Lord in the highest sphere
On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell;
I have borne a banner before Alexander. ...

I am a wonder whose origin is not known.
I have been in Asia with Noah in the Ark,
I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra ...
I shall be until the doom on the face of the earth. ...
I was originally little Gwion,
And at length I am Taliesin.
