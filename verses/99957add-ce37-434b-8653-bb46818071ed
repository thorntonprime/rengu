Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
I HAVE HEARD OF LETTING the world be, of leaving it alone; I have never
heard of governing the world. You let it be for fear of corrupting the
inborn nature of the world; you leave it alone for fear of distracting
the Virtue of the world. If the nature of the world is not corrupted,
if the Virtue of the world is not distracted, why should there be any
governing of the world?
