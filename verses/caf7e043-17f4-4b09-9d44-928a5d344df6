With one small fulcrum, a lever can move tons of weight. With one greedy
thought, years of integrity can be corrupted. A greedy thought is the seed
of fear and confusion. It will grow wildly. The material gain that a greedy
act brings is a small gain indeed. To act without greed and lose some
material benefit is also, therefore a small loss. But to lose oneâ€™s
integrity! That is an immense loss! The enlightened person stands in awe of
the fulcrum.
