Title: A Saddle on Every Particle of Space
---
Most are still a leaf spinning between heaven and earth.

What can one see of their surroundings in a state of fragile or
chaotic motion?

Either settle on the ground and come to know its astounding wonder and
sing to us from there,

or maybe sharpen up your meditations and get lifted higher and reside
in the radiant stratosphere

until you turn into such a fine holy ash you integrate with all.

Put a saddle on every particle of space and ride like a wild cowboy,
and just keep going. Having fun everywhere,

while you sink your spurs deeper into all Being -- and into what can be
called God ... Who then just laughs.
