\"Music begins with fear, and because of this fear there is dread, as of
a curse. Then I add the weariness, and because of the weariness there
is compliance. I end it all with confusion, and because of the
confusion there is stupidity. And because of the stupidity there is the
Way, the Way that can be lifted up and carried around wherever you go."
