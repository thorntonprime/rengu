His (the philosopherâ€™s) awkwardness is fearful, and gives the impression of
imbecility. When he is reviled, he has nothing personal to say in answer to
the civilities of his adversaries, for he knows no scandals of any one, and
they do not interest him; and therefore he is laughed at for his sheepishness;
and when others are being praised and glorified, in the simplicity of his
heart he cannot help going into fits of laughter, so that he seems to be a
downright idiot.
