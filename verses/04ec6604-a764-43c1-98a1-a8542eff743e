Everyone who knows that he is in doubt about something, knows a truth, and in
regard to this that he knows he is certafti. Therefore he is certain about a
truth. Consequently everyone who doubts if there be a truth, has in himself a
true thing on which he does not doubt; nor is there any true thing which is not
true by truth. Consequently whoever for whatever reason can doubt, ought not to
doubt that there is truth.
