Title: Becoming Emptiness
---
Our work is simply thisï¼š to become
the emptiness that can receive,

like the thirst that brings us
to the well, the dryness

that causes water to run uphill,
and become simple enough

to receive the one who is nothing,
and empty enough to hunger

for the nothing that is God,
which even then is love.
