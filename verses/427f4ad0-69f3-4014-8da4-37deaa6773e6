I thought that no beloved would ever appear for me in this world.
I could not see the roses for the thorns.
But then the rose garden appeared and no thorns remain.
I went about always dissatisfied, but none of that remains.
What remains is the One.
I used to have high regard for religion and custom,
but now, even religion does not exist for me.
