Entered into Divine Mind, herself made over to That, she (the soul) at first
contemplates that Realm, but once she sees that Higher still she leaves all
else aside. Thus when a man enters a house rich in beauty he might gaze about
and admire the varied splendor before the master appears; but once seeing him
he would ignore all else and look to him alone.
