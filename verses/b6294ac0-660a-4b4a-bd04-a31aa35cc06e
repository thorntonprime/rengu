Title: I Know the Way You Can Get
---
I know the way you can get when you have not had a drink of Love;
your face hardens, your sweet muscles cramp. Children become concerned about
 a strange
look that appears in your eyes which even begins to worry your own mirror
 and nose.
Cats sense your sadness and call an important conference in a tall tree.
They decide which secret code to chant to help your mind and soul.
Even angels fear that brand of madness that arrays itself against the world
and throws sharp stones and spears into the innocent and into one's self.
O I know the way you can get if you have not been out drinking Loveï¼š
You might rip apart every sentence your friends and teachers say, looking
 for hidden clauses.
You might weigh every word on a scale like a dead fish.

You might pull out a ruler to measure from every angle in your darkness
the beautiful dimensions of a heart you once trusted.
I know the way you can get if you have not had a drink from Love's hands.
That is why all the Great Ones speak of the vital need to keep remembering God,
so you will come to know and see Him as being so giving and wanting, just
 wanting to help.
That is why Hafiz says, "Bring your cup near me, for I am a Sweet Old Vagabond
 with an
infinite leaking barrel of Light and Laughter and Truth that the Beloved
 has tied to my back.
Dear one, indeed, please bring your heart near me. For all I care about is
 quenching your thirst for freedom!
All a sane man can ever care about is giving Love!"
