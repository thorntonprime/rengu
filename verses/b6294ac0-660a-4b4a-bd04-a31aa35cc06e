Title: I Know the Way You Can Get
Description: November 24
---
I know the way you can get when you have not had a drink of Love;

your face hardens, your sweet muscles cramp. Children become concerned
about a strange

look that appears in your eyes which even begins to worry your own
mirror and nose.

Cats sense your sadness and call an important conference in a tall
tree.

They decide which secret code to chant to help your mind and soul.

Even angels fear that brand of madness that arrays itself against the
world

and throws sharp stones and spears into the innocent and into one’s
self.

O I know the way you can get if you have not been out drinking Love：

You might rip apart every sentence your friends and teachers say,
looking for hidden clauses.

You might weigh every word on a scale like a dead fish.
