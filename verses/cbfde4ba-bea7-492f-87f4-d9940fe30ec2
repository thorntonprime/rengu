Relationship persists so long as subsidiary cause persists, and subsidiary
cause persists so long as quest persists, and quest persists so long as thou
persistest, and thou persistest so long as thou seest Me not; but when thou
seest Me, thou art no more, and when thou art no more, quest is no more, and
when quest is no more, subsidiary cause is no more, and when subsidiary cause
is no more, relationship is no more, and when relationship is no more, limit is
no more, and when limit is no more, veils are no more.
