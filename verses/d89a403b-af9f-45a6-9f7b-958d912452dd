Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita： “By devotion in work He knows me,
knows what in truth I am and who I am, Then, having known me in truth,
He enters into me.”

The states of life, Brahmacharya： the life of the student in chastity
under his Guru, Grhastha： the life of the householder begetting children,
practicing Karma Yoga, Vanaprastha： the forest life, My present life,
A life ofprivacy and quasi-retirement, Is there one more stage? Yes,
Sanyasa： total renunciation, Homelessness, begging, The Sanyasin lives
only on food given to him, He is freed from all ritual obligations, The
sacred fire is kindled only within, No household shrine, No temple, He is
entirely turned to deliverance, renouncing all activity and attachment,
all fear, all greed, all care, without home, without roof, without place,
without name, without office, without function, without reputation,
without care for reputation, without being known.
