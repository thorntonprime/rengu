Before a man studies Zen, to him mountains are mountains and waters are waters;
after he gets an insight into the truth of Zen through the instruction of a
good master, mountains to him are not mountains and waters are not waters;
but after this when he really attains to the abode of rest, mountains are
once more mountains and waters are waters.
