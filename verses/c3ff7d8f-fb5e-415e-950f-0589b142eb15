sit in the clean breeze
sleep in the high white clouds
no one can spit in your face
when you're there
hum a tune, and laugh
let the rest of them
yoke themselves to millstones
hide in a hole, with peace, and joy
east? it's within me.
and west? that too.

clouds may be thick or thin
windows may be dark or bright
take it easy,
you can break the poor old dragon's jaw
by pulling teeth for "meaning".
stumble along, as upright as you can
and don't
be avaricious.
who tries
to hold what flashes in the worldly storm, will drown.
flow and you'll fill the forms
stop, and you'll leave a hole
doing? within me.
and hiding? that too.

pretend to be stupid, act like a fool
pretend to be deaf, to be dumb
what can a man make that's lasting?
hum a few phrases, pour out more wine
dream white clouds coiling your green mountain pillow
see everywhere embroidered white with peonies.
flourishing? within me.
and fading? that too.
