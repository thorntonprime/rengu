So don't be frightened, dear friend, if a sadness confronts you larger
than any you have ever known, casting its shadow over all you do. You must
think that something is happening within you, and remember that life has not
forgotten you; it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why would
you want to exclude from your life any uneasiness, any pain, any depression,
since you don't know what work they are accomplishing within you?
