If the Kong (C=tonic) is disturbed, then there is disorganization; the Prince
is arrogant.

If the Shâng (D) is disturbed, then there is deviation; the officials are
corrupted.

If the Kyô (E) is disturbed, then there is anxiety; the people are unhappy.

If the Chi (G) is disturbed, then there is complaint; public services are too
heavy.

If the Yù (A+) is disturbed, then there is danger; resources are lacking.

If the five degrees are all disturbed, then there is danger; ranks encroach
upon each other -- this is what is called impudence -- and, if such is the
condition, the destruction of the Kingdom may come in less than a day. ...

In periods of disorder, rites are altered and music is licentious. Then sad
sounds are lacking in dignity, joyful sounds lack in calm. ... When the spirit
of opposition manifests itself, indecent music comes into being. ... When the
spirit of conformity manifests itself, harmonious music appears. ... So that,
under the effect of music, the five social duties are without admixture, the
eyes and ears are clear the blood and the vital spirits are balanced, habits
are reformed, customs are improved, the Empire is in complete peace.
