Our mind and body are by nature pure; but we sully them with sinful
thoughts and deeds. In order to restore ourselves to our original purity,
we need only to clean away the accumulated dirt. But how do we proceed with
the cleansing process? Do we put a barrier between us and the occasions of
our bad habits? Do we remove ourselves from the places of temptation? No.
We cannot claim victory by avoiding the battle. The enemy is not our
surroundings, it is in ourselves. We have to confront ourselves and try to
understand our human weakness. We have to take an honest look at ourselves,
at our relationships and our possessions, and ask what all our self-
indulgence has gotten us. Has it brought us happiness? Surely not.

If we are ruthlessly honest weâ€™ll have to admit that it was our own foolish
egotism that soiled us. This admission is painful to make. Well, if we want
to melt ice we have to apply heat. The hotter the fire, the quicker the ice
melts. So it is with wisdom. The more intense our scrutiny, the quicker we
will attain wisdom. When we grow large in wisdom we dwarf our old
egotistical self. The contest is then over.
