Pradakshina (the Hindu rite of going round the object of worship) is
‘All is within me'. The true significance of the act of going round
Arunachala is said to be as effective as circuit round the world. That
means that the whole world is condensed into this Hill. The circuit
round the temple of Arunachala is equally good： and self-circuit
(i.e. turning round and round) is as good as the last. So all are
contained in the Self. Says the Ribhu Gita, ‘I remain fixed, whereas
innumerable universes, becoming concepts within my mind, rotate within
me. This meditation is the highest circuit {pradakshina).’
