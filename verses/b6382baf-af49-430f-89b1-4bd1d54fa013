Commentary: The work refered to [on the second day] is the creation of
  a 'firmament', with the corresponding division of the higher from
  the lower waters, hence bringing into manifestation the "Empire of
  the Demiurge".
Format: verse

God hates the Duall Number; being known
The lucklesse number of division：
And when He blest each sev’rall Day, whereon
He did His curious operation;
’Tis never read there (as the Fathers say)
God blest His work done on the second day.
