Notes:
  '1': Frost symbolizes the first signs of decay and death in human
    affairs. With these advance warnings a man can take precautions
    to check the decay in time.
  '2': Symbolic of heavenly and earthly forces in struggle, with black
    here representing heavenly forces and yellow representing earthly
    forces. The earthly dragon vies with the heavenly dragon for power.
    Such a struggle brings great harm to both.

Title: The Passive Principle
---
\  Success wil be sublime,
    Begin the search today!
  The paath is lost at first,
    But virtue shows the way.
  Befriend the south and the west,
    ignore the east and the north.
  Persistence will yield success,
    and bring good fortune forth!

Passivity of earthly forces, silent and tranquilï¼š The Image of the Passsive
Principle. The subjective power can act with tremendous power because of
its exceeding softness.

  When frost[1] appears upon the ground
  And geese are high in the sky,
  Beware when signs like these abound
  For winter's ice is nigh!

  Spend your life in righteous living;
  Earthly forces do the giving!

  Modesty, thouygh concealing for a time,
  Leads to beauty, and sucess sublime!

  The wise man acts with great restraint,
  Avoiding name and fame.
  This he does without complaint,
  Avoiding harm and blame!

  The wise man wears his virtue as if an undercoat,
  To warm the wearer's hear, not to flaunt and gloat.

  Dragons fighting in the woods shed black and yellow blood;[2]
  So men of lesser good destroy man's brotherhood.
