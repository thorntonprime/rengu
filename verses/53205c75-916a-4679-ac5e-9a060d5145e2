  Title: The Clouds Should Know Me by Now
---
as flowing waters disappear into the mist
we lose all track of their passage
every heart is its own Buddha
ease off; become immortal

wake upï¼š the world's a mote of dust
behold heaven's round mirror
turn loose; slip past shape and shadow
sit side by side with nothing -- save Tao
