A handsome face, that fine young man,
and deep his knowledge of the Classics and the
 Histories.
All call him Elder,
all grant him the title of Scholar ...
But he doesn't have a post yet ...
and he has no knowledge of planting and reaping.
Winter's here. All he owns is the ragged cloak
he uses to cover his books, not himself.
