Heaven and earth are enduring.
The reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give
 themselves life.
Hence they are able to be long-lived.

Therefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first,
Treats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved.

Is it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to
 accomplish his private ends?
