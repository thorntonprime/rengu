The soul says to the senses, ‘Leave me! I must cool myself!’ The senses answer,
‘Lady!  wilt thou be refreshed by the tears of Mary Magdalene? Can they suffice
thee?’

  SOUL：
    Hush! ye know not what I mean!
    Hinder me not! I would drink of the unmingled wine!

  SENSES：
    Lady! In virgin chastity
    The love of God is ready for thee!

  SOUL：
    That may be so. For me
    It is not the highest.
