Confucius said, "Meng-sun did all there was to do. He was advanced
beyond ordinary understanding and he would have simplified things even
more, but that wasn't practical. However, there is still a lot that he
simplified. Meng-sun doesn't know why he lives and doesn't know why he
dies. He doesn't know why he should go ahead; he doesn't know why he
should fall behind. In the process of change, he has become a thing
[among other things], and he is merely waiting for some other change
that he doesn't yet know about. Moreover, when he is changing, how does
he know that he is really changing? And when he is not changing, how
does he know that he hasn't already changed? You and I, now - we are
dreaming and haven't waked up yet. But in his case, though something
may startle his body, it won't injure his mind; though something may
alarm the house [his spirit lives in], his emotions will suffer no
death. Meng-sun alone has waked up. Men wail and so he wails, too -
that's the reason he acts like this.
