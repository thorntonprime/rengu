Title: Fengxue's Iron Ox
---
Fengxue, when at the government office of Ying province,
ascended the hall and said, "The ancestral masters' imprint on the mind
is an appearance resembling the function of the arrival of the iron
ox. If it leaves, then the imprint remains. If it remains, then the
imprint is ruined. As it is just so, if it does not leave and does not
remain, is imprinting then correct, or is not imprinting then correct?"

At that time, there was an old timer Lupi who came
forward and asked, "Someone first class having the function of the
arrival of the iron ox begs the teacher do not hang onto imprints (alt.
do not hand over an imprint)."

Xue said. "In the habit of fishing for whales and giant
salamanders immersed in the vast clear and still waters, yet alas, the
frogs are strolling and rolling over in the muddy sand."

Pi stood still pondering.

Xue gave a shout and said, "Old Timer, why don't you
speak further?"

As Pi was deciding how to discuss it, Xue hit him once
with the whisk.

Xue said, "Can you go back and remember what you were
able to say at first? Try to raise it and see."

As Pi was deciding to open his mouth to speak, Xue again
hit him once with the whisk.

The magistrate said, "The Buddha Dharma and Dharma of
Kings are one kind."

Xue said, "What principle of the Way do you see in
particular?"

The magistrate said, "One ought to be decisive. Not
being decisive goes backward and invites this disorder."

Xue then descended from the seat.

Getting to catch Lupi sitting astride the iron ox,

The spear and armor of the Three Profundities have not been frivolously
pledged.

The citadel of the King of Chu trespasses towards the water of the
lineage.

The shout has come down ordering to withdraw and reverse the flow.
