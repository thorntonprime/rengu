There is a man who makes a meal of rosy cloudsï¼š
where he dwells the crowds don't ramble.
Any season is just fine with him,
the summer just like the fall.
In a dark ravine a tiny rill drips, keeping time,
and up in the pines the wind's always sighing.
Sit there in meditation, half a day,
a hundred autumns' grief will drop away.
