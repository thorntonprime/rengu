Title: Pearl
---
Once, I went to the seashore and gathered shells.
You gathered up my skirt, saying it would be muddied.
Returning home, you said I was like a child, playing with shells.
Then you went out and bought me a diamond, you did.

That day I plucked a pearl from an oyster
and put it in your pocket.
Where is that pearl?
Why do you let others see it?
