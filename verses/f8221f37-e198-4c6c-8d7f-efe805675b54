Now that which is one according to the literal sense, is however three
according to the mystical and spiritual sense. For in all the books of
Holy Writ in addition to the literal sense, which the words express
outwardly, there is a conception of the threefold spiritual sense,
namely the allegorical, whereby we learn what we should believe
concerning Godhead and manhood; the moral, whereby we learn how we
should live; and the anagogical, whereby we learn in what manner we
must cling to God. Whence the Holy Writ teaches these things, namely
the eternal begetting and incarnation of Christ, the order of living,
and the union of God and the soul. The first regards faith; the
second, actions (mores); the third, the end of both. For the first,
one should sweat at the study of the doctors; for the second, the
study of the preachers; for the third, the study of the
contemplatives. Augustine teaches us especially the first; Gregory
teaches especially the second; Dionysius however teaches the third.
Anselm follows Augustine; Bernard follows Gregory; Richard follows
Dionysius. For Anselm excells in reasoning; Bernard, in preaching;
Richard, in contemplation. Hugh however teaches all three things.
