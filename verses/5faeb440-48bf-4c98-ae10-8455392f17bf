And (the demon) said： ... Like as thy Christ helpeth thee in that
thou doest, so also my father helpeth me in that I do; and like as for
thee he prepareth vessels worthy of thine inhabiting, so also for me
he seeketh out vessels whereby I may accomplish his deeds; and like as
he nourisheth and provideth for his subjects, so also for me he
prepareth chastisements and torments, with them that become my
dwelling-places; and like as for a recompense of thy working he giveth
thee eternal life, so also unto me he giveth for a reward of my works
eternal destruction; and like as thou art refreshed by thy prayer and
thy good works and spiritual thanksgivings, so I also am refreshed by
murders and adulteries and sacrifices made with wine upon altars; and
like as thou convertest men unto eternal life, so I also pervert them
that obey me unto eternal destruction and torment： and thou receivest
thine own and I mine.
