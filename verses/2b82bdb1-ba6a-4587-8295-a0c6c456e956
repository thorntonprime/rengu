Perhaps the most important reason for ‘lamenting’ is that it helps us to
realize our oneness with all things, to know that all things are our relatives;
and then in behalf of all things we pray to Wakan-Tanka that He may give to us
knowledge of Him who is the source of all things, yet greater than all things.
