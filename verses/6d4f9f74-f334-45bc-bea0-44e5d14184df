Title: Visiting the Brothers
---
The long yellow side of the monastery faces the sun on a sharp rise with
fruit trees and beehives. I climb sweating into the novitiate, put down the
water bottle on the cement floor. The bell is ringing. I have some duties
in the monastery. When I have accomplished these, I return to the woods. In
the choir are the young monks, patient, serene, with very clear eyes, thin,
reflective, gentle. For fifteen years I have given them classes, these
young ones who come, and grow thin, become more reflective, more silent. But
many of them are concerned with questions. Questions of liturgy, questions
of psychology, questions of history. Are they the right questions? In the
woods there are other questions and other answers, for in the woods the
whole world is naked and directly present, with no monastery to veil it.

Chanting the Alleluia in the second mode： strength and solidity of the
Latin, seriousness of the second mode, built on the Re as though on a
sacrament, a presence. One keeps returning to the Re as to an inevitable
center. Sol-Re, Fez-Re, Sol-Re, Do-Re. Many other notes in between,
but suddenly one hears only the one note. Consonantia： all notes,
in their perfect distinctness, are yet blended in one.

In the heat of noon I return through the cornfield, past the barn under
the oaks, up the hill, under the pines, to the hot cabin. Larks rise out
of the long grass singing. A bumblebee hums under the wide shady eaves.
