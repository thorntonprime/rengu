Commentary: Suhrawardi gives this as his own experience, gained through
  'continual solitude and many ascetic practices', and then addsï¼š 'But if any
  one is not satisfied with this proof, he may devote himself to ascesis, and
  to the service of the mystics; and perhaps he will thereby acquire a
  "natural disposition", and will thereupon see the Light which radiates in
  the world of divine Powers, and the substances of the celestial realm.'
By: Suhrawardi

All forms of being in this corporeal world are images of pure Lights, which
exist in the spiritual world.
