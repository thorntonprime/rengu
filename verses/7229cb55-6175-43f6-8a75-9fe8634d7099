Accept me, dear God, accept me for this while.

Let those orphaned days that passed without you be forgotten.

Only spread this little moment wide across Your lap, holding it under
Your light.

I have wandered in pursuit of voices that drew me, yet led me
nowhere.

Now let me sit in peace and listen to Your words in the soul of my
silence.

Do not turn away Your face from my heart's dark secrets, but burn
them till they are alight with your fire.
