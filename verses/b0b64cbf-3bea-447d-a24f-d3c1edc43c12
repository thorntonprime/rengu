Consider the difference between iron and ironï¼š between cold and hot iron,
such is the difference between souls, between the tepid soul and that kindled
by divine fire. When the iron is first cast into the fire it certainly appears
to be as dark as it is cold. But after having been a time in the flame of the
fire it grows warm and gradually changes its dark colour. Visibly it begins
to glow, and little by little draws the likeness of fire into itself until
at last it liquefies entirely and ceases altogether to be itself, changing
into another kind of thing. So also, the soul absorbed in the consuming fire
in the furnace of the divine love, surrounded by the glowing body of eternal
desires, first kindles then grows red hot, at last liquefies completely and
is altogether changed from its first state.
