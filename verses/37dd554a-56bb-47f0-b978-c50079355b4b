A complete fast is a complete and literal denial of self. It is the tuest
prayer. 'Take my life and let it be always, only, all for Thee' is not,
should not, be a mere lip or figurative expression. It has to be a reckless
and joyous giving without the least reservation. Absention from food and
even water is but the mere beginning, the least part of the surrender.
