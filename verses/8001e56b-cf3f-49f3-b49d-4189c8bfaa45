    Title: Ninth Duino Elegy
Title: A Hunger Drives Us
Description: May 18
Format: Verse
---
A hunger drives us.
We want to contain it all in our naked hands,
our brimming senses, our speechless hearts.
We want to become it, or offer it -- but to whom?
We could hold it forever -- but, after all,
what can we keep? Not the beholding,
so slow to learn. Not anything that has happened here.
Nothing. There are the hurts. And, always, the hardships.
And there's the long knowing of love -- all of it
unsayable. Later, amidst the stars, we will seeï¼š
these are better unsaid.
