There is a divine purpose behind every physical calamity. That perfected
science will one day be able to tell us beforehand when earthquakes will
occur, as it tells us today of eclipses, is quite possible. It will be
another triumph of the human mind. But such triumphs even indefinitely
multiplied can bring about no purification of self without which nothing
is of any value.
