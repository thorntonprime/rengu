The upward flight of the soul is always towards its perfect identity with the
Great One who is the same through and in all. The river of life struggles
through all obstacles and conditions to reach the vast and infinite ocean of
existence. -- God. It knows no rest, no freedom and no peace until it mingles
with the waters of immortality and delights in the vision of infinity.
