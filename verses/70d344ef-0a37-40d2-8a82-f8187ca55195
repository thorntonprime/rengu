Title: Go for a Walk If It Is Not Too Dark
---
Go for a walk, if it is not too dark. Get some fresh air; try to
smile.

Say something kind to a safe-looking stranger, if one happens by.

Always exercise your heart's knowing. You might as well attempt
something real along this path：

Take your spouse or your lover into your arms the way you did when you
first met.

Let tenderness pour from your eyes the way the Sun gazes warmly on the
earth.

Start a game with some children. Extend yourself to a friend.

Sing a few ribald songs to your pets and plants— why not let them get
drunk and loose?

Let's toast every rung we've climbed on evolution's ladder.

Whisper, "I love you! I love you!" to the whole mad world.

Let's stop reading about God -- we will never understand Him.

Jump to your feet, wave your fists, threaten and warn the whole
universe

that your heart can no longer live without real and lasting feelings!
