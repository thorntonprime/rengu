Title: The Man with Money
---
There was once a man who
had a hundred dollars.
He lost forty, but still, he had sixty.
I tried to comfort him,
saying, "You have sixty bucks,
my friend!"
But all he could do was
gaze upon his suffering.
Lovers, they would sit and stare
into each other's eyes,
clinging.
