And today, once again, a new morning： bright, with close, rounded clouds that
frame expanses of the immeasurably deep sky. Agitation in the treetops. In
everything else, restfulness. Windfall of apples. The grass softly invites
you to walk out of the house. The dimness inside is alive with lights on
antique silver, and their reflections in the looking glass confuse the eye
as to what is enclosed within the mirror's frame.

There are so many days here, none like any other. And beneath all their
differences is this great similarity： the gratitude in which they are
received.
