Title: We Have Some Leverage
---
Always assume you are on the best of terms with God, for, dear, I will tell
 you a truth： We have some leverage over Him.
How do I know this? It was pretty easy to figure out with this fine brain.
In short： Each of us is like His only heir.
Spoiled and difficult as we may be, He is very willing to put up with us
 until we are enthroned.
