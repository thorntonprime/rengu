Title: Beyond, II
---
You are beyond seeing and naming and knowing
and loving and You remain the no-thing who Is

and the no-being who is not beyond and remains
in what was and is and will be and You are

the light that shines in the dark that is my life and
the Yes that sings in the No of no-thing-ness and

the song of everywhereness in what is and will be.
