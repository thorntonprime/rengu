Title: Guishan’s “I Withdraw and Beg”
---
Guishan (J. Isan), Wufeng (J. Goh) , and Yunyan (J.
Ungan) stood together as attendants for Baizhang. Baizhang asked
Guishan, If side by side you withdraw throat and lips, how do you
speak to make it alive?

Guishan said, I withdraw and beg the Venerable to
speak.

Zhang said, I dont decline to turn to you and speak,
but I fear then that afterwards I would lose my children and
grandchildren for descendants.

Therefore ode says

I withdraw and beg the Venerable to speak.

The tigers head gives birth to horns coming out from the wild grasses.

In the ten island-continents, spring is ended and flowers are withered.

In the forest of coral trees, the sun is brilliantly bright.
