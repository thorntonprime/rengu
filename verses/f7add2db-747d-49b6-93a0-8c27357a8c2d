\"When the frog in the caved-in well heard this, he was dumfounded with
surprise, crestfallen, and completely at a loss. Now your knowledge
cannot even define the borders of right and wrong and still you try to
use it to see through the words of Chuang Tzu - this is like trying to
make a mosquito carry a mountain on its back or a pill bug race across
the Yellow River. You will never be up to the task!
