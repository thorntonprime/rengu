Title: Mystery in Servitude
---
There is really no place for I can't in love. A thought like that goes
 against the grain of light's astounding ability.
I saw caring's beauty in action; there was a splendor there I needed
 to imbibe.
But such a force, mastery in service, it tears you from your moorings,
it will bring you into an arena where a gladiator you will need to become,
 but one that may never get cheered.
Some heroic deed you will do in silence, for that is greatness's
 preference -- no fame.
If the world comes to know you, be a good host to the attention you get.
Use all as a tool, dear, to build a shelter for your mind, and others in need.
