One may heal with holiness, one may heal with the law, one may heal with
the knife, one may heal with herbs, one may heal with the Holy Word; amongst
all remedies this one is the healing one that heals with the Holy Word; this
one it is that will best drive away sickness from the body of the faithful;
for this one is the best-healing of all remedies.
