\"You would!" said Lien Shu. "We can't expect a blind man to appreciate
beautiful patterns or a deaf man to listen to bells and drums. And
blindness and deafness are not confined to the body alone - the
understanding has them too, as your words just now have shown. This
man, with this virtue of his, is about to embrace the ten thousand
things and roll them into one. Though the age calls for reform, why
should he wear himself out over the affairs of the world? There is
nothing that can harm this man. Though flood waters pile up to the sky,
he will not drown. Though a great drought melts metal and stone and
scorches the earth and hills, he will not be burned.
