Title: It's Afternoon
---
Speak quietly
and say nothing that is not true.

It's afternoon. We need to be quiet
for a while. Speaking would be
such an orchard to walk in,
if we could do it without alphabet and sounds.

These stories and images and conversations
through which we try to show the inner life,
Husam and I,
they are like a donkey's head
that we carry from the skinning pit
to the kitchen. Let further changes come.

I give word-shape to this poetry.
Husam supplies the essence.

No, that's wrong. Both come from Husam,
Ziya-Haqq, the sun that is one
with earth and sky, one with intention and heart.
Husam, when my spirit completely recognizes yours,
they recall our being one.
