Believe me, if my rank and station were not what they are, I should enjoy
nothing so much as a solitary life, or to have joined Diogenes in his
tub. For I behold this world full of vanity, greed, cruelty, venality, and
iniquity; and I rejoice in the prospect of the glorious life to come. I no
longer wonder, as once I did, that the true Sage, though he owns the Stone,
does not care to prolong his life; for he daily sees heaven before his eyes,
as you see your face in a glass. When God gives you what you desire, you
will believe me, and not make yourself known to the world.
