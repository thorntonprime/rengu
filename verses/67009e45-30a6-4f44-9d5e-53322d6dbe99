Title: I Have Come into This World to See This
Description: November 22
---
I have come into this world to see this：

the sword drop from men’s hands even at the height of their arc of
anger

because we have finally realized there is just one flesh to wound and
it is His -- the Christ’s, our Beloved’s.

I have come into this world to see this： all creatures holding hands

as we pass through this miraculous

existence we share on the way to even a greater being of soul,

a being of just ecstatic light, forever entwined and at play with Him.

I have come into this world to hear this： every song the earth has
sung since it was conceived in the Divine’s womb

and began spinning from His wish, every song by wing and fin and hoof,
every song by hill and tree and woman and child;
