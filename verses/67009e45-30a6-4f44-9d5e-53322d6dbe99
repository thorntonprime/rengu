Title: I Have Come into This World to See This
---
I have come into this world to see this：
the sword drop from men's hands even at the height of their arc of anger
because we have finally realized there is just one flesh to wound and it is
 His -- the Christ's, our Beloved's.

I have come into this world to see this：
all creatures holding hands as we pass through this miraculous
existence we share on the way to even a greater being of soul,
a being of just ecstatic light, forever entwined and at play with Him.

I have come into this world to hear this：
every song the earth has sung since it was conceived in the Divine's womb
and began spinning from His wish, every song by wing and fin and hoof,
 every song by hill and tree and woman and child;
every song of stream and rock, every song of tool and lyre and flute, every
 song of gold and emerald and fire,
every song the heart should cry with magnificent dignity to know itself as God;
for all other knowledge will leave us again in want and aching-only imbibing
 the glorious Sun will complete us.

I have come into this world to experience this： women and men so true to
 love they would rather die before speaking an unkind word,
women and men so true their lives are His covenant -- the promise of hope.

I have come into this world to see this：
the sword drop from men's hands even at the height of their arc of rage
because we have finally realized, we have finally realized, there is just
 one flesh we can wound and it is our own.
