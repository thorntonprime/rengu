He who has apprehended the beauty of the Good can apprehend nothing else;
he who has seen it can see nothing else; he cannot hear speech about aught
else; he cannot move his body at all; he forgets all bodily sensations and
all bodily movements, and is still. But the beauty of the Good bathes his
mind in light, and takes all his soul up to itself, and draws it forth from
the body, and changes the whole man into eternal substance.
