  - Discernment-Truth=The Eye Of Eternity-Supreme Center=The Eternal Now
By: Eckhart
---
The now wherein God made the first man and the now wherein the last man
disappears and the now I speak in, all are the same in God where there is
but the now The happenings of a thousand years ago, days spent millenniums
since, are in eternity no further off than is this moment I am passing now;
the day to come a thousand years ahead or in as many years as you can count,
is no more distant in eternity than this very instant I am in.
