Title: Only My Nothingness
---
When I learn to let go of who I think I am
and relinquish all I think I need to be me,

You cannot resist entering my heart, and do,
for when I let go of thinking that my life is mine

You finally have room to make it Yours and
cannot help but come to fill what is empty,

for You want only my nothingness and to
that You give Your allness, and so I shall know

Your heart as mine and mine as Yours.
