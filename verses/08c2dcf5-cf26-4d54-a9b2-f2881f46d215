Title: A Garden Could Rise in Barren Places
---
If you don't watch out I just might say something you will never
forget. Then what will you do?

Those words might organize a gang inside your mind who undertake a
strategic plot, or just bully you to make some changes in your life
you have wanted to make but could not, on your own.

A time-release capsule, my touch and sounds, with secret instructions
hidden within that can slowly seep into the cracks your heartaches
cause.

All of a sudden you might find yourself cleaning your room more,
helping old people across the street, or giving your money away. Yes,
I am dangerous.

A garden could rise in barren places in you if our eyes met.

I could turn you into a store that sells shuttle tickets to other
planets; but what use would that be?

The thing isï¼š I think someone should get more use out of you for
something that will bring pleasure to others.

It might as well be me who practices some tough love now and then.
