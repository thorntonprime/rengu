I wished, and understanding was given me： and I called upon God, and the
spirit of wisdom came upon me：

And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in
comparison of her.

Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone： for all gold in comparison
of her, is as a little sand, and silver in respect to her shall be counted as
clay.

I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light：
for her light cannot be put out.
