Title: In Me God Takes His Joy
---
Yesterday -- more truly spring, and this is a spring dawn today, cold, but
with birds singing. First time I have heard the whistling of the towhee this
year. And the cardinals up in the woods to the west.The promise grows more
and more definite. I look up at the morning star： in all this God takes
His joy, and in me also, since I am His creation and His son, His redeemed,
and member of His Christ. Sorrow at the fabulous confusion and Violence of
this world, which does not understand His love -- yet I am called not to
interpret or condemn this misunderstanding, only to return the love which
is the final and ultimate truth of everything, and which seeks all men’s
awakening and response. Basically I need to grow in this faith and this
realization, not only for myself but for all men.

To go out to walk slowly in this wood-this is a more impor- tant and
significant means to understanding, at the moment, than a lot of analysis
and a lot of reporting on the things “of the spirit.”
