There is no doubt, it seems to me, that there have been profound changes in
the experience of man in the last thousand years. In some ways this is more
evident than changes in the patterns of his behavior. There is everything
to suggest that man experienced God. Faith was never a matter of believing
He existed, but of trusting in the Presence that was experienced and known
to exist as a self-validating datum. It seems likely that far more people
in our time neither experience the Presence of God, nor the Presence of His
absence, but the absence of His Presence.
