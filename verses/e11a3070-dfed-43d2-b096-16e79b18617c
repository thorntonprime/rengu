Pursuing life and pursuing death
A third will be followers of life,
A third will be followers of death.
And a third chase life into the realms of death.
Why? Because they want to live to excess.
I’ve heard that those who control their life,
Never encounter tigers or rhinos on their travels,
Are never harmed by weapons when in a fight.
There’s nowhere for the rhino to plant its horn.
There’s nowhere for the tiger to set its claw.
There’s nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.
Why? Because they’ve abolished the realm of death.
