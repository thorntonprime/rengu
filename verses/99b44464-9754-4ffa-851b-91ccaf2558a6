God is absolute or restricted, as He pleases; and the God of religious belief
is subject to limitations, for He is the God who is contained in the heart of
His servant. But the absolute God is not contained by any thing, for He is the
being of all things and the being of Himself, and a thing is not said either to
contain itself or not to contain itself.
