Title: Resurrection Is Our Destiny.
Format: mixed
---
In the night office, St, Ambroseï¼š all must rise from the dead, Resurrection
is our lot, Life is our destiny whether we want it or not, But to be risen
and not want it, to hate life, is the resurrection of judgment, Man is not,
and cannot be, a merely ephemeral thing, But if he wills to be evanescent,
to remain in what is not, he is a living contradiction.

Thunder, lightning and rain all night, Heaviest rain for a long time,
Floods in the bottoms, Water bubbling in under the basement wall of the
washroom, Novitiate garden flooded in the NW corner. (One day the whole
retaining wall will go if this keeps up.) Sound of waters in the valley.

  My love is
  The fragrance of the orchid
  And the sound of waters

says the Haiku on my lovely Zen calendar.
