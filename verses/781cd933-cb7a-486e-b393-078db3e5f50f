At the beginning all sorts of bad thoughts will rise up in your mind
the moment you sit down to meditate. ... Because of this certain
disciples abandon their spiritual practices. If you attempt to chase a
monkey, he will try to leap on you in vengeance. And thus it is with
the old impregnations (samsk√¢ras); bad thoughts try to avenge
themselves and redouble their efforts as soon as you strive to awaken
in yourself benefic and divine reflections. Your enemy is ingenious in
ways to paralyse your efforts to have him expulsed from the house.
Resistance is a natural law.
