Title: The World Honored One Ascends The Seat
---
\[Yuanwu's] Appended pointer says：

The stirring lute strings of a different melody are difficult to meet
in 1,000 years. To see the rabbit and release the hawk and at once to
take hold of the excellent; to sum up all language to become a single
phrase; to gather up [as many] realms as the sands of the Great
Chiliocosm to become a single dust mote; to die the same and be born
the same; [to get] eight holes by drilling seven [times]; still, is
there one who can confirm accordingly? A test is raised to examine
it.

Raised：

One Day the World Honored One ascended the seat.

Manjusri, to be clear, struck and said, "Carefully
observe the Dharma of the King of Dharma. The Dharma of the King of
Dharma is thus."

The World Honored One then descended the seat.

Xuedou's ode arises：

Those who are established among the ranks of sages crowded together
know

The decree of the Dharma of the King of Dharma is not like this.

If there was a guest from Sindh among the assembled,

Why was it necessary for Manjusri to strike down once?
