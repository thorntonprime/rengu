  Title: The Clouds Should Know Me by Now
---
a charge to students of the Tao：
"nothing to do; nothing to lose"
among the flowers, darkening clouds
above the pines, a sinking sun

spring deepens urgent birdcalls
autumn declines to the cries of insects
dawn： darkness wrapped in darkness
this, the end of every quest
