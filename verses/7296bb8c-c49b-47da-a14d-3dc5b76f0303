A trail to find, direction is
It's so obscured, my compass failed

To find a path, all maps will fail
Longing to arrive, is there such a thing?

So travel in peace, and leave everything

Because change, change, change, is all that happens now
So have faith, faith, faith, in something some how
You can give, give, give, maybe that's all you'll get to choose
So live, live, live, like you've got nothing to lose, because
  you've got nothing

I'll be the first, to lay flowers on my grave
Because ash to itself, and dust is the same

So let all I have burn up in flames

Because change, change, change, is all that happens now
So have faith, faith, faith, in something or someone some how
You can give, give, give, maybe that's all you'll get to choose
So live, live, live, like you've got nothing to lose, because
  you've got nothing

Nothing here is forever, and nothing here will stay
So let all that's tangible burn up in flames

Because change, change, change, is all that happens now
So have faith, faith, faith, in something or someone or your self some how
You can give, give, give, maybe that's all you'll get to choose
So live, live, live, like you've got nothing to lose,
  because you've got nothing
