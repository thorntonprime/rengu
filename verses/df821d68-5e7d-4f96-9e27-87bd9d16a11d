Some disdain to call this Art sacred, because they say that Paynims sometimes
acquire a knowledge of it, though God cannot be desirous of conferring any good
thing upon them, seeing that their wilful and stubborn unbelief renders them
incapable of possessing that which is the cause of all good. ... To this
objection, we answer what we know to be true, that the science of this Art has
never been fully revealed to anyone who has not approved himself worthy by a
good and noble life, and who has not shewn himself to be deserving of this
gracious gift by his love of truth, virtue, and knowledge.
