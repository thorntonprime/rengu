God made this name (All√¢h) a mirror for man, so that when he looks in it,
he knows the true meaning of 'God was and there was naught beside Him',
and in that moment it is revealed to him that his hearing is God's hearing,
his sight God's sight, his speech God's speech, his life God's life,
his knowledge God's knowledge, his will God's will, and his power God's
power, and that God possesses all these attributes fundamentally; and then
he knows that all the aforesaid qualities are borrowed and metaphorically
applied to himself, whereas they really belong to God.
