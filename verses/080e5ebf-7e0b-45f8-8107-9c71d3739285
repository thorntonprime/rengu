Hot, stuffy, misty summer weather.

Now I have got to get my life in order at last without desperation and
without compromise. A long succession of wasted opportunities. The need for
serious spiritual discipline, especially long periods of meditation. Going on
my own, not being held within the limits of accepted practice and custom in
the community. I owe it to the community, which has allowed me opportunities
for it, more or less, to forge ahead where they do not go. This is certainly
implied by the situation in which I have been placed. I have misused this to
a great extent, thinking I was obliged to form a judgment concerning world
affairs. That obligation is by no means certain, whereas my obligation to
explore “the interior space” is absolutely clear.

From Tertullian： Malim nullum bonum quam uanum： “I would rather
have nothing than have vanity.”

When we face the vanity of our best efforts, their triviality, their
involvement in illusion, we become desperate. And then we are tempted to
do anything as long as it seems to be good. We may abandon a better good
with which we have become disillusioned, and embrace a lesser good with
a frenzy that prevents us from seeing the greater illusion.

So, through efforts that may seem to be wasted, we must patiently go
towards a good that is to be given to the patient and the disillusioned.
