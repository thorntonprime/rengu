Nothing in the world is gained without desire, without motivation. You can
take the route of honesty and be sincere in the pursuit of your desire or
you can take the route of deceit and get what you want under false
pretenses. One way or the other, when you acquire the object of your desire
you’ll become attached to it – for at least as long as it takes you to
desire something else. But between the routes of sincerity and guile lies a
path in which neither strategy is necessary. This is the route that leads
to understanding worldly desires for what they are. On this route your
motivations die in their tracks while you move straightforwardly on.
