    Title: Letter to Rudolf Bodlander
Title: The Scale of the Heart
---
To take things seriously -- as my books are said to do -- betokens no heaviness
of spirit. Taking things seriously is no more than according things their true
weight and seeing their innate value. It springs from a desire to weigh things
on the scale of the heart rather than indulging in suspicion and distrust.
