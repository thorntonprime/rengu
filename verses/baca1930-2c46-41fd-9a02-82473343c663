Title: The Paradise Season
---
It is already hot as summer. Everything is breaking into leafl and the
pine saw fly worms are all over the young pines.

This morning I sat in the monastery dentist’s chair having my teeth
cleaned and X-rayed, while the students banged and walloped next door
demolishing the old library.

Early mornings are now completely beautiful -- with the Easter moon in
its last quarter high in the blue sky, and the light of dawn spreading
triumphantly over the wide, cool green valley. It is the paradise season!

Then yesterday Flannery O’Connor’s new book, Everything That Rises
Must Converge, arrived, and I am already well into it, grueling and
powerful! A relentlessly perfect writer, full of tragedy and irony. But
what a writer! And she knows every aspect of the American meanness, and
violence, and frustrationAnd the Southern struggle of will against inertia.

A pine warbler was caught in the novitiate scriptorium, beating against
the window, and I got a good look at him letting him out. A couple of
towhees are all around the hermitage.
