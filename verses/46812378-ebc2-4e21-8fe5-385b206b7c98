Never took your side
Never cursed your name
I keep my lip shut tight
Until you go

You've come as far
As you're ever gonna get
Until you realize
That you should go

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

In the dying light
I'm the only one here
And I will cover you
Until you go

Cause if I told the truth
I will always be free
And keep a prize with me
Until you go

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your prayer head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling

Into the night for once
We're the only ones left
I bet you even know
Where we could go

When it all fucks up
You put your head in my hands
Its a souvenir
For when you go

I'm in misery where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share will never keep your prayer head from falling
The way is long but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share will never keep our cold hearts from calling
