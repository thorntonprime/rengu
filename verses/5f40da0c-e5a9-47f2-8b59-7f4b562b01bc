A hunter goes into the bush. He finds an old human skull. The hunter says：
"What brought you here?" The skull answers： "Talking brought me
here." The hunter runs off. He runs to the king. He tells the king： "I
found a dry human skull in the bush. It asks how its father and mother are."

The king says： "Never since my mother bore me have I heard that a
dead skull can speak." The king summons the Alkali, the Saba, and the Degi
and asks them if they have ever heard the like. None of the wise men has
heard the like and they decide to send guards out with the hunter into the
bush to find out if his story is true and, if so, to learn the reason for
it. The guards accompany the hunter into the bush with the order to kill
him on the spot should he have lied. The guards and the hunter come to the
skull. The hunter addresses the skull： "Skull, speak." The skull is
silent. The hunter asks as before： "What brought you here?" The skull
does not answer. The whole day long the hunter begs the skull to speak,
but it does not answer. In the evening the guards tell the hunter to make
the skull speak, and when he cannot they kill him in accordance with the
king's command. When the guards are gone the skull opens its jaws and asks
the dead hunter's head： "What brought you here?" The dead hunter's
head replies： "Talking brought me here!"
