Description: The Blessed Virgin, to Barbara Reuss, at Marienfried,
  Germany
---
Christ is so unknown because I am not known. ... The world will have
to drain the cup of wrath to the dregs because of the countless sins
through which His Heart is offended.  The star of the infernal regions
will rage more violently than ever and will cause frightful
destruction because he knows that his time is short and because he
sees that many have already gathered around my sign.
