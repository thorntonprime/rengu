\"Don’t be chained to love and suffering. Instead, cut the ties of love and
 you will rejoice in your heart.” So he said in a loud voice.
The Master is quite a fool.
He does not know： true it hurts to be tied with love, but it will hurt more
 to cut the ties of love, it will hurt more than even death.
In the tight binding of love’s bonds lies their unbinding.

Thus great liberation is to be had in the bonds themselves.
My love, I was afraid the rope of your love might be weak so I doubled the
 strands of my love for you.
