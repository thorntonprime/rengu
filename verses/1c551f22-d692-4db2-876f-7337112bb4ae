By: Eckhart

St Augustine being asked the meaning of eternal life answered and saidï¼š Dost
thou ask me what is eternal life? Ask eternal life, see what it says itself.
None knows what heat is like the hot, nor wisdom like the wise, none knows the
meaning of eternal life so well as the eternal life itself.
