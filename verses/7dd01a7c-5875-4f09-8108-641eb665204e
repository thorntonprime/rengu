Commentary: It is related that Bernadette when shown various representations
  of the Virgin chose the icon style as being the most faithful to the
  Original.

When Fabisch the sculptor showed Bernadette at Lourdes an effigy (of the
Virgin) in marble destined for Massabieille, poor Bernadette remained
discomfited. ‘It is beautiful,’ she said, to avoid hurting him; ‘but it is not
Her!’ she added, to avoid lying. From that time she never ceased to protest
against the statues that were presented to her：

‘My good Mother, how they disfigure you!’

‘These artists when they see You are going to be given a surprise!’

‘Look at this goitre that has been made of the Holy Virgin!’

And again：

‘I never said that she raised her head, but that she raised her eyes!’
