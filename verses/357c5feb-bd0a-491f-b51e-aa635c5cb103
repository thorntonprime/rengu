Title: Consider What Choices
---
You wreck my shop and my house
and now my heart, but how can I run
from what gives me life?

I am weary of personal worrying,
in love with the art of madness.

Tear open my shame and show the mystery.
How much longer do I have to fret
with self-restraint and fear?

Friend, this is how it is.
We are fringe sewn inside
the lining of a robe.

Soon we will be loosened,
the binding threads torn out.

The beloved is a lion.
We are the lame deer in his paws.
Consider what choices we have.
