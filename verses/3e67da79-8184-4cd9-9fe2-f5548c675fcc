The same Truth may appear under contrary Notions, and in contrary
Opinions. This is the Glory of Spiritual Things, that they can cloth themselves
with all manner of Earthly Shapes. It is the Greatness and Majesty of Jesus
Christ, that he passes thro' all Forms and all Conditions; and yet still
is the same in the midst of them all. Is there any thing more contrary than
a Cross and a Throne? And yet you may see the same Jesus in both.
