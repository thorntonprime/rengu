If anyone be unacquainted with Nature’s methods, he will find our Art
difficult, although in reality it is as easy as to crush malt, and brew beer.
In the beginning when, according to the testimony of Scripture, God made heaven
and earth, there was only one Matter, neither wet nor dry, neither earth, nor
air, nor fire, nor light, nor darkness, but one single substance, resembling
vapour or mist, invisible and impalpable. It was called Hyle, or the first
Matter. If a thing is once more to be made out of nothing, that ‘nothing’ must
be united, and become one thing; out of this one thing must arise a palpable
substance, out of the palpable substance one body, to which a living soul must
be given -- whence through the grace of God, it obtains its specific form.
