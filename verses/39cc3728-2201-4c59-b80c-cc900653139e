  - Life-Love=The Primordial State=The Terrestrial Paradise
  - 790
By: William Law
Commentary: >
  \'"From within", every religion is the doctrine of the one Self and its
  terrestrial manifestation, and the means for abolishing the false self,
  or the means for the mysterious reintegration of our "personality" in the
  celestial Prototype. "From without", religions are "mythologies", or more
  specifically symbolisms, disposed in view of different human receptacles,
  and manifesting by their limitations, not a contradiction in divinis, but
  on the contrary a mercy' (Schuonï¼š Sentiers de Gnose, p. 82).

There is but one salvation for all mankind, and that is the life of God in the
soul. God has but one design or intent towards all mankind and that is to
introduce or generate His own life, light, and Spirit in them, that all may be
as so many images, temples and habitations of the Holy Trinity. ... There is
not one for the Jew, another for a Christian.  and a third for the heathen. No;
God is one, human nature is one, salvation is one. and the way to it is one;
and that is, the desire of the soul turned to God.
