You are now entered upon a scene of business, where I hope you will one day
make a figure. ... Business does not exclude (as possibly you wish it did)
the usual terms of politeness and good breeding, but, on the contrary,
strictly requires them. ... Be upon your guard against the pedantry
and affectation of business, which young people are apt to fall into,
from the pride of being concerned in it too young. They look thoughtful,
complain of the weight of business, throw out mysterious hints, and seem
big with secrets which they do not know. Do you on the contrary never
talk of business but to those with whom you are to transact it; and learn
to seem vacuous and idle when you have the most business. Of all things,
the volto sciolto and pensieri stretti are necessary.
