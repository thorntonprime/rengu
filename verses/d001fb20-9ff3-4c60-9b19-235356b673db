Suppose a curious and fair woman. Some have seen the beauties of Heaven in
such a person. It is a vain thing to say they loved too much. I dare say
there are ten thousand beauties in that creature which they have not seen.
They loved it not too much, but upon false causes. Nor so much upon false
ones, as only upon some little ones. They love a creature for sparkling eyes
and curled hair, lily breasts and ruddy cheeks; which they should love
moreover for being Godâ€™s Image. Queen of the Universe, beloved by Angels,
redeemed by Jesus Christ, an heiress of Heaven, and temple of the Holy Ghost;
a mine and fountain of all virtues, a treasury of graces, and a child of God.
But these excellencies are unknown. They love her perhaps, but do not love God
more; nor men as much; nor Heaven and Earth at all. And so, being defective to
other things, perish by a seeming excess to that. We should be all Life and
Mettle and Vigour and Love to everything; and that would poise us. ... But God
being beloved infinitely more, will be infinitely more our joy, and our heart
will be more with Him, so that no man can be in danger by loving others too
much, that loveth God as he ought.
