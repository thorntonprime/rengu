I am likewise a mighty king, of the Wheel that Revolveth; and a king who
aboundeth in riches is in no wise happier or mightier than I. ... Ye circle
of officials of the Kingdoms of the World, if ye but served such a Kingdom
as is mine, ye would be transformed into the mightiest of monarchs; and the
power and wealth of all things would spring forth (for you).
