O King, you say that Atman is infinite. Well, that which is infinite must
be unconditioned by time and space. Absence of duality in Atman renders
it incapable of being a cause. A cause exists buth before and after the
effect, as clay does in respect of the jar. But in Atman there is neither
beginning nor end. Besides, a cause must modify or change itself to produce an
effect. Atman being All and Absolute is free from the possibility of change
or modification. Atman is indestructible and immutable. It has never fallen
from its nature. As there is no duality in Atman, so it is neither subject
nor object. Nor is there any action in it. It is eternally pure like the
blue sky or space. O King, and it is your own nature.
