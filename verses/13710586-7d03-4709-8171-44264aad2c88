Description: Old Chinese Poem
Format: verse
---
In the courtyard there grows a strange tree.
Its green leaves ooze with a fragrant moisture.
Holding the branch I cut a flower from the tree.
M eaning to send it away to the person I love.
Its sweet smell fills my sleeves and lap.
The road is long, how shall I get it there?
Such a thing is not fine enough to sendï¼š
But it may remind him o f the time that has past since he left.
