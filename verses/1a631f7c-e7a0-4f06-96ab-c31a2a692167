The soul is a more vigorous and puissant thing, when it is once restored to
the possession of its own being, than to be bounded within the narrow sphere
of mortality, or to be straightened within the narrow prison of sensual and
corporeal delights; but it will break forth with the greatest vehemency, and
ascend upwards towards immortality; and when it converses more intimately with
religion, it can scarce look back upon its own converses, though in a lawful
way, with earthly things, without being touched with a holy shamefaccdness
and a modest blushing.
