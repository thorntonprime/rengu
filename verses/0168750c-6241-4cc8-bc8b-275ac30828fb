Nothing is more becoming to woman than courtesy. And let not the miserable
vulgar make another mistake in the meaning of this word, believing it to be the
same as liberality; for liberality is, a special and not general courtesy.
Courtesy and virtue are one; and because, of old, virtue and fine manners were
the custom of courts (whereas to-day the contrary is true), this word was
derived from court; and courtesy was none other than the custom of the court.'
If we should wish to-day to take such a word from the courts, especially of
Italy, there would be nothing we could use except baseness.
