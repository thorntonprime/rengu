I always wanted to go to East Cliff,
more years than I can remember,
until today I just grabbed a vine
and started up. Halfway up
wind and a heavy mist closed in,
and the narrow path tugged at my shirtï¼š
it was hard to get on. The slickery
mud under the moss on the rocks
gave way, and I couldn't keep going.
So here I stay, under this cinnamon tree,
white clouds for my pillow,
I'll just take a nap.
