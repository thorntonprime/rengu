(Pythagoras) divinely healed and purified the soul, resuscitated and saved
its divin√ß part, and conducted to the intelligible its divine eye, which,
as Plato says, is better worth saving than ten thousand corporeal eyes;
for by looking through this alone, when it is strengthened and clarified by
appropriate aids, the truth pertaining to all beings is perceived.
