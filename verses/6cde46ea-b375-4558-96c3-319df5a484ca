He (the American Indian) believes profoundly in silence -- the sign of
a perfect equilibrium. Silence is the absolute poise or balance of body,
mind, and spirit. The man who preserves his selfhood ever calm and unshaken
by the storms of existence -- not a leaf, as it were, astir on the tree;
not a ripple upon the surface of shining pool -- his, in the mind of the
unlettered sage, is the ideal attitude and conduct of life.

If you ask him： ‘What is silence?’ he will answer： ‘It is the
Great Mystery!’ ‘The holy silence is His voice!’
