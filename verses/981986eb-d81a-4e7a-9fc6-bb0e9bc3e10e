True Dharma seekers who live in the world use their daily activity as a
polishing tool. Outwardly they may appear to be very busy, like flint
striking steel, making sparks everywhere. But inwardly they silently grow.
For although they may be working very hard, they are working for the sake
of the work and not for the profits it will bring them. Unattached to the
results of their labor, they transcend the frenetic to reach the Way’s
essential tranquillity. Doesn’t a rough and tumbling stream also sparkle
like striking flints  --   while it polishes into smoothness every stone in its
path?
