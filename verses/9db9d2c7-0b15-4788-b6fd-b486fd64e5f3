Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim
at purifying yout thoughts and everything will be well. There is nothing
more potent than thought. Deed follows word and word follows thought. The
world is the result of a mighty thought and where the thought is mighty
and pure the result is always mighty and pure.
