I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou
shouldest keep them from the evil.

They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.

As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into
the world.
