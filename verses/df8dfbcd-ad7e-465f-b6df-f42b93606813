Here in this vast landscape, swept by winds from the sea, I wonder if there
is any person anywhere who can answer the questions that stir in the depths
of your being. For even the best miss the mark when they use words for what
is elusive and nearly unsayable. But nonetheless, I believe you are not left
without a solution, if you turn to things like those that are refreshing my
eyes. If you ally yourself with nature, with her sheer existence, with the
small things that others overlook and that so suddenly can become huge and
immeasurable; if you have this love for what is plain and try very simply,
as one who serves to win the confidence of what seems poorï¼š then everything
will become easier for you, more coherent and somehow more reconciling,
perhaps not in your conscious mind, but in your innermost awareness.
