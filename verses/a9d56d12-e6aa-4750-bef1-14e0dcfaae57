Truth is the only resting-place of the soul; it is its atonement and peace with
God; all is and must be disquiet, a succession of lying vanities, till the soul
is again in the truth in which God at first created it. And therefore, said the
Truth, ‘Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart; and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.’
