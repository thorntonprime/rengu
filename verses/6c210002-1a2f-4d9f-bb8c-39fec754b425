If you want to learn theory,
talk with the theoreticians. That way is oral.

When you learn a craft, practice it.
That learning comes through the hands.

If you want dervishhood, spiritual poverty,
and emptiness, you must be friends with a sheikh.
Talking about it, reading books, and doing practices
do not help. Soul receives from soul that knowing.

The mystery of spiritual emptiness
may be living in a pilgrim's heart,
but the knowing of it might not yet be his.

Wait for the illuminating openness,
as though your chest were filling with light.

Do not look for it outside yourself.
There is a milk fountain inside of you.
Do not walk around with an empty bucket.

You have a channel into the ocean,
yet you ask for water from a little pool.
Beg for the love-expansion.
The Qur'an says, And he is with you.

There is a basket of fresh bread on your head,
yet you go door to door asking for crusts.

Knock on the inner door. No other.
Sloshing knee-deep in clear streamwater,
you keep wanting a drink from other people's waterbags.

Water is everywhere around you,
but you see only barriers that keep you from water.

A horse is moving beneath the rider's thighs,
yet still he asks, Where is my horse?
Right there, under you. Yes, this is a horse,
but where's the horse? Can't you see? Yes,
I can see, but whoever saw such a horse?

Mad with thirst, he cannot drink from the stream
running so close by his face.

He is like a pearl on the deep bottom
wondering, inside the shell, Where is the ocean?

His mental questionings form the barrier.
His physical eyesight bandages his knowing.
Self-consciousness plugs his ears.
Stay bewildered in God and only that.
