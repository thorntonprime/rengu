Courage to dare kills, Courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one
 brings harm.
Of these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by
 heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question.
Heaven hates what it hates - Who knows why! Even the Sage finds it
 difficult. Heaven's Tao does not contend But prevails, Does not speak, But
 responds, Is not summoned, But arrives, Is utterly still, But plans all
 actions.
Heaven's net is wide, wide, Loose - But nothing slips through.
