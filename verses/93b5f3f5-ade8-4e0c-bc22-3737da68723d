Attain to utmost emptiness
Cling singleheartedly to interior peace
While all things are stirring together
I only contemplate the return
For flourishing as they do
Each of them will return to their root
To return to the root is to find peace.
To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny.
To fulfill one's destiny is to be constant.
To know the constant is called insight.
