When appearances and names are put away and all discrimination ceases, that
which remains is the true and essential nature of things and, as nothing can be
predicated as to the nature of essence, it is called the ‘Suchness' of Reality.
This universal, undifferentiated, inscrutable ‘Suchness’ is the only Reality,
but it is variously characterised as Truth, Mind-essence, Transcendental
Intelligence, Noble Wisdom, etc. This Dharma of the imagelessness of the
Essence-nature of Ultimate Reality is the Dharma which has been proclaimed by
all the Buddhas, and when all things are understood in full agreement with it,
one is in possession of Perfect Knowledge, and is on his way to the attainment
of the Transcendental Intelligence of the Tathagatas.
