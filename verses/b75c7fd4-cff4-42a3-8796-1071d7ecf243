Title: Hunt Music
Description: September 8
---
Musk and amber remind us
of the air at sunrise,
when any small motion feels part
of some elaborate making.

The body's harp gets handed
to the soul to play.

The stringsï¼š rage, jealousy,
all the wantings mix their energy-music.

Who tuned this instrument?
Where wind is a string
and also Shams' eyes

reflecting a gazelle as it turns
to stalk the hunting lioness.
