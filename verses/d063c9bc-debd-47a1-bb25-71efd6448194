Each year as the year's day passed
I've cocked my ear to hear
the fireworks pop, so sharp, so clear,
all through the night 'til dawn.

This year I didn't listen,
fearing the cock crow's newsï¼š
my sixtieth year.

The noise has died now,
to the sound of a page of the calendar turning.
A little time's left, Maybe, just a scrap?

The cock, at least, shows sympathy,
so slow to crow for me.
That's fine, I'll just go on
being fifty-nine.
