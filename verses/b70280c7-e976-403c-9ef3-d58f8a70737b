Surely thou art Bh√¢gavat who appears before me; the great Hari, whose dwelling
was on the waves. ... Salutation and praise to thee, O first male, the lord of
creation, of preservation, of destruction! Thou art the highest object, the
supreme ruler, of us thy adorers, who piously seek thee. ... Let me not, O
lotus-eyed, approach in vain the feet of a deity whose perfect benevolence has
been extended to all.
