Gnosis is fire and faith light, gnosis is ecstasy and faith a gift. The
difference between the believer and the gnostic is that the believer sees
by the light of God and the gnostic sees by means of God Himself, and the
believer has a heart, but the gnostic has no heart; the heart of the believer
finds rest in worship, but the gnostic finds no rest save in God.
