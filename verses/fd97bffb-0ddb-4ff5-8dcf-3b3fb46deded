  Title: The Clouds Should Know Me by Now
---
study the Way and never grow old
distrust emotions; truth will emerge
sweep away your worries
set even your body aside

autumn drives off the yellow leaves
yet spring renews every greed bud
quietly contemplate the pattern of things
nothing here to make us sad
