Those who are serious about the Dharma seek the insights of wisdom in
everything they do. Whether busy or at rest, whether alone or in a crowd,
in every situation they find themselves, they strive to remain consciously
aware. Such vigilance isnâ€™t easy. But once they get used to the practice,
it becomes so natural an activity that nobody around them even suspects
what they are achieving.
