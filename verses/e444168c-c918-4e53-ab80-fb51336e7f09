A seeker after Truth, a follower of the Law of Love, cannot hold anything
against tomorrow. God never provides for the morrow. He never creates more
than what is strictly needed from day to day. If, therefore, we repose
faith in His Providence, we should rest assured that He will give us every
day our daily bread, supplying enough that we require.
