In its true state, mind is naked, immaculate; not made of anything, being
of the Voidness; clear, vacuous, without duality, transparent; timeless,
uncompounded, unimpeded, colourless; not realizable as a separate thing,
but as the unity of all things, yet not composed of them; of one taste,
and transcendent qver differentiation.
