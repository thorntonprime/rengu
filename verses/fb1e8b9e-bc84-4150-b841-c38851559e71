This marriage feast signifies the entrance into the highest state of union that
can be between God and the soul in this life. Or in other words it is the birth
day of the Spirit of love in our souls, which, whenever we attain it, will
feast our souls with such peace and joy in God as will blot out the remembrance
of everything that we called peace or joy before.
