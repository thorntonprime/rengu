Title: Meditation
---
The small boat of infinite meditation is cast adrift
  on surging moonlit waves.
It crosses a distant land of stars until it reaches
  a place of unknown name.
In this land, a child’s smile, spring morning, and the sound of the sea
  blend together to become a person.
In this land, people don’t know the royal seal;
they trample thoughtlessly upon gold,
  and don’t know to love a beauty’s youth.
The people of this land love laughter and the blue sky.

I moor the boat of meditation in this land.
The people clasp my hands and urge me to stay,
but I return to build a heavenly land in my lover’s heart,
  should he come back.
The moonlit waves with beaded crests sway in time
  to the dancing grass.
