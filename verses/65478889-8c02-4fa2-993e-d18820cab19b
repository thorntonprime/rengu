It is the mind that makes one wise or ignorant, bound or emancipated.
One is holy because of his mind, one is wicked because of his mind,
one is a sinner because of his mind, and it is the mind that makes one
virtuous. So he whose mind is always fixed on God requires no other
practices, devotion, or spiritual exercises.
