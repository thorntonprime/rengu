Title: Helping the Dawn Appear
Description: September 13
---
Strange the way my shadow began to fall. I was standing in a field helping
 the dawn
appear, and when its body, the sun, was fully lifted into the sky
I was amazed to see my shadow in front of me as I faced that luminous candle
 we all know.
I turned around in amazement, wondering what could possibly be there;
it was the soul, our soul helping God to find new horizons.
Strange to some, but not to love evolved, no longer any shadow ... I now cast.
