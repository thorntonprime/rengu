To be right, a person must do one of two thingsï¼š either he must learn
to have God in his work and hold fast to him there, or he must give up
his work altogether. Since, however, man cannot live without
activities that are both human and various, we must learn to keep God
in everything we do, and whatever the job or place, keep on with him,
letting nothing stand in our way.
