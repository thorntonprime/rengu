Mind precedes all mental states
Mind is the chief： they are all mind wrought
If with an impure mind one speaks or acts
Suffering follows like the wheel following the foot of the ox.

Mind precedes all mental states
Mind is the chief： they are all mind wrought
If with a pure mind one speaks and acts
Happiness follows, like a never departing shadow.
