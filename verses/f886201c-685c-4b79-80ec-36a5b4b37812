The unstoppable stream of the egoâ€™s conscious thoughts cannot stay still
long enough to comprehend the truth. Yet people are always trying to think
up a barrier to the flow, to use thoughts to stop thinking. Thoughts are
like wildcats. We would never use one wildcat to tame another.

How then do we enter the state of non-thought? We understand the
non-substantial nature of both the one who thinks and the thought itself. We
understand that in reality there is not even a single tiny thought of a
thought, or a thinker either. When we bear witness to this reality, our
own testimony liberates us from bondage of thoughts of having no thoughts.
