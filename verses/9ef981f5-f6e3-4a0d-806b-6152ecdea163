Title: Giver and Gift
---
All that I have and all I ever
will is on temporary loan,

given for a season like the leaves
of spring that soon enough will

rustle in the late autumn winds,
for You give with a single intentï¼š

that I might know that You are
Giver and Gift, the one beyond

any how and every why, one
I didn't earn and can never lose,

and one that will never lose me.
