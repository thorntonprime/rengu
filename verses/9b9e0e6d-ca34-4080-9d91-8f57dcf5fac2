Bring together in yourself all opposites of quality, heat and cold, dryness and
fluidity; think that you are everywhere at once, on land, at sea, in heaven;
think that you are not yet begotten, that you are in the womb, that you are
young, that you are old, that you have died, that you are in the world beyond
the grave; grasp in your thought all this at once, all times and places, all
substances and qualities and magnitudes together; then you can apprehend God.
