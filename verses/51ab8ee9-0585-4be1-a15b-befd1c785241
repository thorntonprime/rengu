Rapture (wajd) is the blessed plenitude of spirit provoked by the exercise
of invocation, and the blessed plenitude of soul, in communion with the spirit.

Allâh then gratifies His friend with a cup filled with wine that has no
equal, and which intoxicates him with a spiritual drunkenness. His heart
then seems endowed with wings, which raise him to the gardens of sanctity. At
this moment the enraptured one, submerged by this indescribable magnificence,
swoons away losing all consciousness.
