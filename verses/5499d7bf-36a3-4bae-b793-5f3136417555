Title: Rifling Trunks
---
Cut off sageliness, cast away wisdom, and then the great thieves will
cease. Break the jades, crush the pearls, and petty thieves will no
longer rise up. Burn the tallies, shatter the seals, and the people
will be simple and guileless. Hack up the bushels, snap the balances in
two, and the people will no longer wrangle. Destroy and wipe out the
laws that the sage has made for the world, and at last you will find
you can reason with the people.
