\  But, friend,
We speak of what is; not of what might be,
And how ’twere better if ’twere otherwise.
I am the man you see here plain enough：
Grant I’m a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts’ lives!
Suppose I own at once to tail and claws;

The tailless man exceeds me; but being tailed
I’ll lash out lion fashion, and leave apes
To dock their stump and dress their haunches up.
My business is not to remake myself,
But make the absolute best of what God made.
