If a man carries too many worldly burdens, his body will soon wear out. If
he worries about too many worldly problems, his mind will soon collapse. To
be so occupied with material things is a dangerous way to live, a foolish
waste of energy. A man ought to simplify his needs and use his strength to
attain spiritual goals. Nobody ever ruined his mind or body by exercising
self-restraint.
