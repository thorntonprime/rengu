Therefore the sage contemplates Heaven but does not assist it. He finds
completion in Virtue but piles on nothing more. He goes forth in the
Way but does not scheme. He accords with benevolence but does not set
great store by it. He draws close to righteousness but does not labor
over it. He responds to the demands of ritual and does not shun them.
He disposes of affairs and makes no excuses. He brings all to order
with laws and allows no confusion. He depends upon the people and does
not make light of them. He relies upon things and does not throw them
aside. Among things, there are none that are worth using, and yet they
must be used.
