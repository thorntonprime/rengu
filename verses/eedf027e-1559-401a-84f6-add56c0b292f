The Lord says, ‘Stand in the gate of God’s house and proclaim his word,
extol his word". The heavenly Father speaks one Word and that he speaks
eternally and in this Word expends he all his might; his entire God-nature
he utters in this Word and the whole of creatures. This Word lies hidden in
the soul unnoticed and beyond our ken, and were it not for rumours in the
ground of hearing we should never heed it; but all sounds and voices have
to cease and silence, perfect stillness, reign.
