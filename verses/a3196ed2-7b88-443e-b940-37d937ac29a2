Title: More Awake in Dreams
Description: June 20
---
Many are more awake, with greater abilities in dreams, than in the daylight.

I walked through a world last night of such exquisite intricacies ... in my
 sleep some might say.

But no, it was not really like that. It was surely as real as any place you
 ever visited.

Whatever the hand can shape and make last ... the advanced mind can do a
 millionfold.

And love, there too while I slept so alert with perceptions keen and powerful,

did I know you, love, and could more bear your fire.

In dream, in spirit, are we not closer to Her likeness?
