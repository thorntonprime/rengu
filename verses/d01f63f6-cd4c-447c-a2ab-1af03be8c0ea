Tzu-kao said, "In former times when Yao ruled the world, he handed out
no rewards and yet the people worked hard; he handed out no punishments
and vet the people were cautious. Now you reward and punish, and still
the people fail to do good. From now on Virtue will decay, from now on
penalties will prevail. The disorder of future ages will have its
beginning here! You had better be on your way now - don't interrupt my
work!" Busily, busily he proceeded with his farm work, never turning to
look back.
