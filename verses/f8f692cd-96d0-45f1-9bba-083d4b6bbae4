Title: The Man with One Foot and the Marsh Phesant
Format: verse
---
Kung Wen Hsien saw a maimed official
Whose left foot had been cut off --
penalty in the political game!
"What kind of man," he cried, "is this one-footed oddity?
How did he get that way? Shall we say
Man did this, or heaven?"

"Heaven," he said, "this comes from
Heaven, not from man.
When heaven gave this man life, it willed
He should stand out from others
And sent him into politics
To get himself distinguished.
See! One foot! This man is different."

The little marsh pheasant
Must hop ten times
To get a bite of grain.

She must run a hundred steps
Before she takes a sip of water.
Yet she does not ask
To be kept in a hen run
Though she might have all she desired
Set before her.

She would rather run
And seek her own little living
Uncaged.
