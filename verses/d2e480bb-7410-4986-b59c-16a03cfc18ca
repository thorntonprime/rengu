I can see the top of T'ien-t'ai,
alone above the others.
The wind that moves them, gives
rhyme to pine and bamboo.
Moon's in the rhythm
of the sea, its tides.
Look down,
green of the mountains spreads forever.
Talk of mystery! Watch the white clouds!
Loving nature, you love mountains and water, for
 sure：
It's at the root of every human's way：
as sunset is the turning of the Tao.
