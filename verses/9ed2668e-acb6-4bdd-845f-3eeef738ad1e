Must I then humble my common sense, to the point of submitting it blindly
to the decrees of an assembly which is only a crowd? Is it not permitted to
me as to Lycurgus to conspire against laws which are inflicting evil on my
country? If it pleases the Athenians to decree the penalty of death against
any one who proposes to use for the expenses of war the funds intended
to put on comedies, will Phocion respect that ridiculous law? Should
Demosthenes obey it? And must 1, without being either of these great men,
go gaily to the spectacle, while Philip is advancing toward our gates? ...

Nay, nay; Cicero was right; we are agreed, as an incontestable truth,
that a citizen must obey the magistrate, and the magistrate the laws;
and you may be sure that in a republic where that order is observed the
injustice of the laws will never give rise to pernicious quarrels. But
these happy republics are rare in this world, since men, always borne
along toward tyranny or toward slavery by their passions, are evil or
foolish enough to make unjust or absurd laws, what other remedy can we
apply to this evil than disobedience? From it will rise some troubles;
but why be frightened of that? The trouble is itself a proof that we love
order and that we want to restore it. Blind obedience is on the contrary
a proof that the doltish citizen is indifferent to good and to evil;
and then, what will you hope for? The man who thinks works to strengthen
the empire of reason; the man who obeys without thinking throws himself
into slavery, because he favors the power of the passions.
