We easily believe and hope that which we desire. The Divine Love hath
a complacency in all things, as it comprehendeth them in their Divine
Root. It hath a good will to all things, as they stand in the same
Divine Root with it self. From this Complacency, this Desire, this
Divine Root it believeth, it hopeth all things. It believeth all
things to be Divine Tabernacles, like that in the Wilderness, which
though moving through Desarts. through a Land o f Graves, through a
Land of fiery Serpents, yet answer to their Pattern on the top of the
Mount; though covered with a course Tent, exposed to the fury of the
Sun, and tempests in the midst of Clouds, of dust; yet are
all-glorious within, composed of rich materials, bearing a Divine
Figure, filled with the Divine Presence and Glory. It hopeth all
things, light in the midst of darkness, a flourishing Garden of
Lillies and Roses, in a ground covered, and bound up with all the
darknesses and rigours of the hardest Winter; a treasure of
Honey-Combs in the body of a Lion.
