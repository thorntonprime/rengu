Our soul is of an eternal nature, made a thinking, willing, understanding
creature out of that which hath willed and thought in God from all eternity;
and therefore must for ever and ever be a partaker of the eternity of God.

And here you may behold the sure ground of the absolute impossibility of the
annihilation of the soul. Its essences never began to be, and therefore can
never cease to be; they had an eternal reality before they were in or became
a distinct soul, and therefore they must have the same eternal reality in
it. It was the eternal breath of God before it came into man, and therefore
the eternity of God must be inseparable from it. It is no more a property
of the divine omnipotence to be able to annihilate a soul than to be able
to make an eternal truth become a fiction of yesterday; and to think it a
lessening of the power of God to say that He cannot annihilate the soul,
is as absurd as to say that it is a lessening of the light of the sun,
if it cannot destroy or darken its own rays of light.
