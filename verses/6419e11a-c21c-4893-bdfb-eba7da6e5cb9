  - Sacrifice-Death=Volition, Obedience and Conformity=Intention
By: St Ignatius Loyola

It would be very bitter if my life-work, the Jesuit Order, should be
dissolved. The establishment of my Society has been the object of all
my endeavors. ... If it were to happen without my guilt, about fifteen
minutes of meditation and recollection in prayer would banish all
disquietude from my soul, even were the whole Society dissolved as
salt in water!
