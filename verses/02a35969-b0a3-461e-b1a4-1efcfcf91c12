Title: Passion's Sky, Sorrow's Sea
---
The autumn sky is high
but cannot rival passion’s sky.
The spring sea is deep
but cannot sound sorrow’s sea.

It’s not that I dislike
the height of passion’s sky;
but my reach is low
and I cannot climb.

I'm not ill at ease
with the depth of sorrow’s sea,
but my legs are short
and I cannot cross.

If my reach increased and I could climb,
passion-sky’s beauty would equal its height.
If my legs grew long and I could cross,
sorrow-sea’s splendor would deepen its drop.

Were passion's sky to collapse
and sorrow’s sea to dry,
I’d rather sink into that water
and fall into that sky.

I had thought passion’s sky high,
but it’s lower than your brow.
I had thought sorrow’s sea deep,
but it drops below your knees.

My reach is low, my legs are short.
But to attain passion’s sky and cross sorrow’s sea
your arms are all I need.
