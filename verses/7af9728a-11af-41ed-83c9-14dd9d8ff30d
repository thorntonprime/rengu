By: Shakespeare
Format: verse
Reference:
  - Body: To every seance a formulae was attached in the shape of oaths
      of secrecy, so tremendous that those who were sincere in their
      belief were never known to break them.
    Source: Ghost Land, p. 50
  - Body: All this I most solemnly, sincerely promise and swear, with a
      firm and steadfast resolution to perform the same, without any
      mental reservation or secret evasion of mind whatever, binding
      myself under no less penalty than that of having my throat cut
      across, my tongue tom out by its roots, and my body buried in the
      rough sands of the sea, at low-water mark, where the tide ebbs and
      flows twice in twenty-four hours, should I ever knowingly violate
      this my Entered Apprentice obligation.

How now. you secret, black, and midnight hags! ...
I conjure you, by that which you profess, --
Howe’er you come to know it, -- answer me：
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodg’d and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders’ heads：
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of Nature’s germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.
