Title: My Hands Were Always Empty
---
Since Easter was early we are already on the threshold of Pentecost.
Yesterday, in bright, blazing sun, we planted cabbage seedlings in the
garden and, over the way, I could hear them mowing hay in Saint Josephâ€™s
field, where probably tomorrow we will all be loading wagons.

Every time I have been in the woods to pray I have loved them more.

At once I remember all the afternoons I had been out in the woods, the
dark afternoons in the gullies along the creeks and the rainy afternoons
on top of the knobs and the day I saner the Pater Noster on one knob and
then on another; the day I found the daffodils in an unexpected place,
and the other day when I picked them in a place where I knew they would
be; and the immense silence of last Good Friday, when I sat on a rotten
log in a sheltered corner by a stream with a relic of the Holy Cross, It
set the seal on all the silences in which I had found Him without seeming
to find anything, and I knew (as I always guessed) that I had every time
come home with something tremendous, although my hands were always empty.
