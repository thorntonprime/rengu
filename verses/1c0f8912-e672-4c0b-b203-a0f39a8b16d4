All the Sastras are meant only to make ... man retrace his steps to the
original source. He need not gain anything new. He must only give up his false
ideas and useless accretions. Instead of doing it he tries to catch hold of
something strange and mysterious because he believes that his happiness lies
elsewhere. That is the mistake.
