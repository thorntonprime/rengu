Title: A Man Married to a Blind Woman
---
A man married to a blind woman told her how beautiful she was every
day. And whenever he said that, she smiled, and her whole body
relaxed.

They lived alone at a small remote oasis where few ever stopped. And
whenever someone did he made sure that no one ever saw his wife,

for a person could openly gasp at her appearance because she was
deformed.

Her husband's voice and that of her sister, who would a few times a
year visit, were the only ones she really knew. And she loved her
simple life on the little farm they had.

Appearances, and our relationship, you should know the truth of those
by nowï¼š

If you woke next to me on any day, I would say to you what he so often
did. My dear, you are so beautiful.
