With your whole heart and soul, seek to regain Reality, nay. seek for
Reality within your own heart, for Reality, in truth, is hidden within
you. The heart is the dwelling-place of that which is the Essence of
the universe, within the heart and soul is the very Essence of God.
Like the saints, make a journey into your self; like the lovers of
God. cast one glance within. As a lover now. in contemplation of the
Beloved, be unveiled within and behold the Essence. Form is a veil to
you and your heart is a veil. When the veil vanishes, you will become
all light.
