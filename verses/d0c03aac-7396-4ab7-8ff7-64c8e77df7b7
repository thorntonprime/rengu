I have found great profit in the vocal prayers that are called ejaculatory,
and especially in the words of the Pater Hosier, which are repeated during many
hours with the mouth, saying for exampleï¼š 'Sanctijicetur Nomen tuum". and
having the heart filled with desire for Him who is enclosed therein.
