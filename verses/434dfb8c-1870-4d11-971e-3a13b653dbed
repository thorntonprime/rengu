Repentance is but a kind of table-talk, till we see so much of the
deformity of our inward nature as to be in some degree frightened and
terrified at the sight of it. There must be some kind of an earthquake
within us, something that must rend and shake us to the bottom, before
we can be enough sensible either of the state of death we are in or
enough desirous of that Saviour, who alone can raise us from it. ...
Sooner or later repentance must have a broken and a contrite heart; we
must with our blessed Lord go over the brook Cedrón, and with Him
sweat great drops of sorrow before He can say for us, as He said for
Himself： 'It is finished.’
