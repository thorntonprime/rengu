Title: A Prayer to the Father
---
Today, Father, the blue sky praises you, The delicate green and orange
flowers of the tulip poplar praise you, The distant blue hills praise you,
with the sweet-smelling air that is full of brilliant light, The bickering
flycatchers praise you, with the lowing bulls and the quails that whistle
over there, and I, too, Father, praise you with these creatures my brothers,
You have made us all together and you have placed me here this morning in
the midst of them, And here I am.

For a long time I prayed, in the years that are past, and I was in
darkness and sorrow and confusion, And no doubt the confusion was my own
fault, No doubt my own will was the root of my sorrow, and I regret it,
O merciful Father, But whatever may have been my sin, the prayer of Your
friends for me and my own prayers were answered, and I am here in this
hermitage before You, and here You see me, Here You love me, Here You
ask the response of my own love, and of my confidence, Here You ask me
to be nothing else than your friend.

To be Your friend is simply to accept your friendship because it is your
friendship, And this friendship is Your life, the Spirit of Your Son, You
have called me here to be Your sonï¼š to be born over again, repeatedly,
in Your light, and in knowledge, and consideration, and gratitude, and
poverty, and praise.
