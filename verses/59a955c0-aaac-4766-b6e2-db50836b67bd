Just as a single remedy is not suitable to all diseases, and medication
varies according to the particular case, so one cannot use for all
the heretics of the different sects the same method of questioning,
investigation, and examination, but should employ a method particular
and appropriate to each case or group. Therefore the inquisitor, as a
wise doctor of souls, will proceed with caution in the investigation
and questioning, according to the persons he is questioning or in whose
company he is conducting the investigation, taking into account their rank,
condition, status, malady and with due regard to local conditions.
