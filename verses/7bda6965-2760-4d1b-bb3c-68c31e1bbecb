Myth makes a connection between our waking consciousness and the mystery
of the universe. It gives us a map or picture of the universe and allows
us to see ourselves in relationship to nature, as when we speak of Father
Sky and Mother Earth. It supports and validates a certain social and moral
order. The Ten Commandments being given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai
is an example of this. Lastly, it helps us pass through and deal with the
various stages oflife from birth to death. The first function of mythology
is to sanctify the place you are in.
