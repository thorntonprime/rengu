Title: Winter Hermitage Under Black Pines
---
It is turning into the most brilliant of winters.

At 6ï¼š45 -- stepped out into the zero cold for a breath of air. Brilliance of
Venus hanging as it were on one of the dim horns of Scorpio. Frozen snow. Deep
wide blue-brown tracks of the tractor that came to get my gas tank the other
day when everything was mucky. Bright hermitage settled quietly under black
pines. I came in from saying the psalms of the Little Hours and the Rosary
in the snow with my nose in pain and sinuses aching. Ears burn now in the
silent sunlit room. Whisper of the gas fire. Blue shadows where feet have
left frozen prints out there in the snow. I drank a glass of dry sherry and
am warm! Lovely morning! How lovely life can be!
