\‘Everything having been created for man’s use, all by consequence has been
made to serve and provide for the needs of rational creatures. The creature
endowed with reason has not himself been created for these things, but for Me,
to serve Me with all his heart and all his affection. Thou seest clearly that
if man is drawn towards my Son, everything is accordingly drawn towards Him.
since all the rest has been made for man.’
