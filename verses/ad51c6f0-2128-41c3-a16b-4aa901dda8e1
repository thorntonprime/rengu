I have seen a place

Whose name is Eternal Hatred,

It is built in the deepest abyss

Out of stones laid there by mortal sin.

Pride was the first stone

Laid by Lucifer. ....

The whole place is upside down, the highest being in the lowest and
most unworthy places. Lucifer sits in the depths bound by his sin and
out of his burning mouth there pour ceaselessly all the sin, torment
and infamy by which Hell and Purgatory and the earth are so piteously
surrounded. ...

How Hell bums and rages in itself, how the devils fight with souls,
how souls seethe and roast, how they swim and wade in the morass and
the stench among the reptiles and filth, how they lie in sulphur and
pitch, neither they nor anyone else can ever tell. Seeing that I.
through Godâ€™s mercy and without effort, had seen this great distress.
I, poor wretch, suffered so greatly from the stench and the
subterranean heat that for three days I could neither sit nor walk nor
use any of my five senses. I was as a being struck by lightning. But
my soul suffered no harm for it had brought no infection with it which
would there merit eternal death. It is possible that a pure soul among
these wretched creatures might be to them an everlasting light and
comfort.
