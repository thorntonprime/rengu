\"Forget it - say no more!" said the carpenter. "It's a worthless tree!
Make boats out of it and they'd sink; make coffins and they'd rot in no
time; make vessels and they'd break at once. Use it for doors and it
would sweat sap like pine; use it for posts and the worms would eat
them up. It's not a timber tree - there's nothing it can be used for.
That's how it got to be that old!"
