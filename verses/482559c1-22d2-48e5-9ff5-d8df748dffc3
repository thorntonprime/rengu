Let me try explaining what I mean. From the Three Dynasties on down,
everyone in the world has altered his inborn nature because of some
[external] thing. The petty man? - he will risk death for the sake of
profit. The knight? - will risk it for the sake of fame. The high
official? - he will risk it for family; the sage? - he will risk it for
the world. All these various men go about the business in a different
way, and are tagged differently when it comes to fame and reputation;
but in blighting their inborn nature and risking their lives for
something they are the same.
