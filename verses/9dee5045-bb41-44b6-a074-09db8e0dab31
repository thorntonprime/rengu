We have been accustomed to thinking that we have to get something from
outside us in order to be happy, but in truth it works the other wayï¼š we
must learn to contact our inner source of happiness and satisfaction and
flow it outward to share with others -- not because it is virtuous to do so,
but because it really feels good.
