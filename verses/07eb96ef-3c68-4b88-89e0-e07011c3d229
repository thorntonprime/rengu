For as the soul is more worthy than the body, so the knitting of the
soul to God (the life of it) by the heavenly food of charity is better
than the knitting of the body to the soul (the life of it) by any
earthly food in this life. This is good for to do by itself, but
without the other it is never well done. This and the other is the
better; but the other by itself is the best. For this by itself
deserveth never salvation; but the other by itself (where the plenty
of this faileth) deserveth not only salvation, but leadeth to the
greatest perfection.
