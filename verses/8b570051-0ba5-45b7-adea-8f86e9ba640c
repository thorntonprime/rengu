Work without doing.
Manage without interfering.
Relish the mundane.
Respect the small as great.
Regard the few as many.
Repair insult with integrity.

With difficult tasks, attend to the easy.
With daunting feats, attend to the small.

All big problems were once easy to solve.
All great deeds were once small to begin.

The person of integrity, never anxious for greatness,
achieves the monumental without effort.

Who is quick to promise
can't meet all his commitments.
Who imagines all things easy
finds difficulty at every turn.

A wise man respects the challenge in every act,
thus nothing ever gets the better of him.
