Best to be like water, Which benefits the ten thousand things And does not
 contend. It pools where humans disdain to dwell, Close to the Tao.
Live in a good place. Keep your mind deep. Treat others well. Stand by your
 word.
Make fair rules. Do the right thing. Work when it's time.
Only do not contend, And you will not go wrong.
