Those who have riches and honours in this world are reaping the fruits of seeds
which they planted in their previous life. Those who do not give alms during
their present life will be extremely poor in the future. Do riches and honour
come by shrewdness? Are the slow witted all poor? Poverty may come as the
result of too much shrewdness.
