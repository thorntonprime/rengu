The precise point at which scales of power turn, like that of the solstice
in either tropic, is imperceptible to common observation; and, in one case
as in the other, some progress must be made in the new direction, before the
change is perceived. They who are in the sinking scale, for in the political
balance of power, unlike to all others, the scale that is empty sinks, and
that which is full rises; they who are in the sinking scale do not easily
come off from the habitual prejudices of superior wealth, or power, or skill,
or courage, nor from the confidence that these prejudices inspire. They who
are in the rising scale do not immediately feel their strength, nor assume
that confidence in it which successful experience gives them afterwards. They
who are the most concerned to watch the variations of this balance, misjudge
often in the same manner, and from the same prejudices. They continue to
dread a power no longer able to hurt them, or they continue to have no
apprehensions of a power that grows daily more formidable.
