The thing to do is to make the Nembutsu practice the chief thing in
life, and to lay aside everything that you think may interfere with
it. ...  If you cannot do it and at the same time provide yourself
with food and clothing, then accept the help of others and go on doing
it.  Or if you cannot get others to help you, then look after yourself
but keep on doing it. Your wife and children and domestics are for
this very purpose, of helping you to practise it, and if they prove an
obstacle, you ought not to have any. Friends and property are good, if
they too prove helpful, but if they prove a hindrance they should be
given up. In short, there is nothing that may not help us to Ôjô, so
long as it helps us to go on the even tenor of our way through life
undisturbed.
