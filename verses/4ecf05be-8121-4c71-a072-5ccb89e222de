---
Certain it doubtless is, brethren, that either thou killest iniquity
or art killed by iniquity.  But do not seek to kill iniquity as if it
were something outside thyself. Look to thyself, mark what fighteth
with thee in thee, and take heed lest thy iniquity, thine enemy,
defeat thee, if it have not been killed. ... That wherewith thou
delightest in the world fighteth against the mind which cleaveth to
God. Let it cleave, let it adhere, let it not weaken, let it not give
wayï¼š it hath great help. It conquereth that in itself which is in
rebellion against itself, if it but persevere in fighting.
