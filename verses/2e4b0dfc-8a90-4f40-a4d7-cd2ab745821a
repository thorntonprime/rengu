As soon as the spirit is transmuted into the body, (the Stone) receives its
power. So long as the spirit is volatile, and liable to evaporate, it cannot
produce any effect; when it is fixed, it immediately begins to operate. You
must therefore prepare it as the baker prepares the bread. Take a little of
the spirit, and add it to the body, as the baker adds leaven to the meal,
till the whole substance is leavened. It is the same with our spirit, or
leaven. The Substance must be continuously penetrated with the leaven, until
it is wholly leavened. Thus the spirit purges and spiritualizes the body,
till they are both transmuted into one. Then they transmute all things, into
which they are injected, into their own nature. The two must be united by a
gentle and continuous fire, affording the same degree of warmth as that with
which a hen hatches her eggs. It must then be placed in a St. Maryâ€™s Bath,
which is neither too warm nor too cold. The humid must be separated from the
dry, and again joined to it. When united, they change mercury into pure gold
and silver. Thenceforward you will be safe from the pangs of poverty. But
take heed that you render thanks unto God for His gracious gift which is
hidden from many. He has revealed the secret to you that you may praise His
holy name, and succour your needy neighbour.
