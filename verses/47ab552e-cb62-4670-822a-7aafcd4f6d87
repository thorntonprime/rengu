It is no easy task for the contemporary Westerner to accept the validity
of the mythic world. We are so accustomed to thinking of myths as fantasy
that We often denigrate people to whom myth was and is an integral part
oilife. We tend to think of such people as ignorant and childlike, with
no understanding of the physical universe.

The relegation of myth and fairy tale to childhood is a recent
phenomenon. Before the twentieth century, myths and fairy tales were
the repository of the wisdom of a whole culture. The people in such
societies had a profound understanding and respect for the psychological
forces symbolized by these tales, and that understanding enabled them to
experience a living spiritual dimension in everyday life.

For the ancient Greeks the gods were real. A Greek who saw a thunderbolt
was reminded of Zeus, and so reminded of another, simultaneous system
of reality. In contrast, when we see a thunderbolt we see a weather
pattern and are probably reminded to watch the six oâ€™clock news for
the weather report!
