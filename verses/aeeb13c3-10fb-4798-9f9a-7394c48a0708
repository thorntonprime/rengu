\"Of all the waters of the world, none is as great as the sea. Ten
thousand streams flow into it - I have never heard of a time when they
stopped - and yet it is never full. The water leaks away at Wei-lu -
I have never heard of a time when it didn't - and yet the sea is never
empty. Spring or autumn, it never changes. Flood or drought, it takes
no notice. It is so much greater than the streams of the Yangtze or the
Yellow River that it is impossible to measure the difference. But I
have never for this reason prided myself on it. I take my place with
heaven and earth and receive breath from the yin and yang. I sit here
between heaven and earth as a little stone or a little tree sits on a
huge mountain. Since I can see my own smallness, what reason would I
have to pride myself?
