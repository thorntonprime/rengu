I desire no man to dislike or renounce his skill in ancient or modern
languages; his knowledge of medals, pictures, paintings, history, geography
or chronology; ... but ... all these things are to stand in their proper
places. ...

Christian redemption is quite of another nature; it has no affinity to any of
these arts or sciences; it belongs not to the outward natural man, but is
purely for the sake of an inward, heavenly nature.
