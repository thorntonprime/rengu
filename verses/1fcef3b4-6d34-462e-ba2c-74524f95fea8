The worshippers of the gods go to the gods; to the ancestors go the
ancestorworshippers; the spirit-worshippers go to the spirits; but My
worshippers come unto Me. ...

Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest as
oblation, whatever thou givest and the austerities thou performest, O
son of Kunti, do that as an offering to Me. ...

Fill thy mind with Me, be thou My devotee, worship Me and bow down to
Me; thus, steadfastly uniting thy heart with Me alone and regarding Me
as thy Supreme Goal, thou shalt come unto Me.
