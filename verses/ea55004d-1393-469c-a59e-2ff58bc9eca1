Title: Laughter
---
What is laughter? What is laughter? It is God waking up! O it is God waking
up!

It is the sun poking its sweet head out from behind a cloud you've been
carrying too long, veiling your eyes and heart.

It is light breaking ground for a great structure that is your real body --
called Truth.

It is happiness applauding itself and then taking flight to embrace everyone
and everything in this world.

Laughter is the polestar held in the sky by our Beloved, who eternally says,

"Yes, dear ones, come this way, come this way toward Me and Love!

Come with your tender mouths moving and your beautiful tongues conducting
songs

and with your movements -- your magic movements of hands and feet and glands
and cells -- dancing!

Know that to God's eye, all movement is a wondrous language, and musicâ€”such
exquisite, wild music!"

O what is laughter, Hafiz? What is the precious love and laughter budding in
our hearts?

It is the glorious sound of a soul waking up!
