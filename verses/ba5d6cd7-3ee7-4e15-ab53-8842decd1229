Title: Bearing Witness to What Is Simple
---
Is there not a false eschatology of the “new heaven and new earth”
which places its hope in the power of science to transform earth and
heaven into places of happiness and bliss? (With God or without Him for
that matter.) 15 the true prospect rather that the stupidity and pride of
man will ruin the earth, and that God will restore it through charity and
the tears of the poor, the “remnant” and the saints? I am not saying
this false eschatology is in that article of K. V. Truhlar’s, which
has excellent things in it -- but theologians occupied with the Christian
and the world are not sufficiently aware of what technology is doing to
the world and, in failing to make distinctions, they tend to embrace all
manifestations of progress without question in “turning to the world”
and in “Christian temporal action.” Hence inevitably we get Christians
in the US, supporting a criminally stupid military adventure in Vietnam.

There is no question for me that my one job as monk is to live the hermit
life in simple, direct contact with nature, primitively, quietly, doing
some writing, maintaining such contacts as are willed by God, and bearing
witness to the value and goodness of simple things and ways, and loving
God in it all. I am more convinced of this than of anything contingent
upon my life, and I am sure it is what He asks of me. Yet I do not always
respond with simplicity.
