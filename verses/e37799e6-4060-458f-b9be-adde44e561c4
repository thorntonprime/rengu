Title: Song of the Bound Chickens
By: Tu Fu
---
The little bond-slave binds our chickens for the market,
And the chickens being bound begin to struggle and proclaim.
The family's up in arms because the chickens eat the ants,
Never thinking that the market means the pot, as far as chickens are concerned.
Ants, chickens; Man, which most deserves concern?
I told the bondman to unbind them.
No end here to the wars of ants and chickens.
I lean in this high place, eyes fixed To the cold flow, to the River.
