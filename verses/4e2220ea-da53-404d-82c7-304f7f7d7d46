The relation of the Rituals to the rectification of the state is the relation
of a balance to weight, of inked string to crookedness and straightness,
of compasses and T-squares to roundness and squareness. The reason is that
provided the balance is truly suspended it is impossible for it to be deceived
over the weight; provided the inked string is truly applied it is impossible
for it to be deceived over the crookedness and straightness (of a line).
