The eternal Word or Son of God did not then first begin to be the Saviour of
the world when He was born in Bethlehem of Judea; but that Word which became
man in the Virgin Mary did from the beginning of the world enter as a word of
life, a seed of salvation, into the first father of mankind. ... Hence it was
that so many eminent spirits, partakers of a divine life, have appeared in so
many parts of the heathen world; glorious names, sons of wisdom, that shone as
lights hung out by God in the midst of idolatrous darkness.
