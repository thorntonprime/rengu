There will come a time, brethren, when ... the ten moral courses of
conduct will altogether disappear, the ten immoral courses of action
will flourish excessively; there will be no word for moral among such
humans -- far less any moral agent. Among such humans, brethren, they who
lack filial and religious piety, and show no respect for the head of
the clan -- â€™tis they to whom homage and praise will be given, just as
to-day homage and praise are given to the filial-minded, to the pious
and to them who respect the heads of their clans. ... The world will
fall into promiscuity, like goats and sheep, fowls and swine, dogs and
jackals.
