How the Way is like stringing a bow!
The upper end is brought down.
The lower end is lifted.
All excess is reduced.
All deficit is restored.
With all parts in balance, it is fit for use.

In nature, any surplus flows
to those without from those with more.
Men instead reverse the flow
from those without to those with more.

Only one with integrity has abundance
and shares it with the world.

The person of integrity
works, expecting no return,
completes his task, not dwelling on it,
and rests, content unto himself.
