  him by Diotima of Mantineia.

He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has learned
to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes toward the end
will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and this, Socrates, is the
final cause of all our former toils) -- a nature which in the first place is
everlasting, not growing and decaying, or waxing and waning; secondly, not fair
in one point of view and foul in another, or at one time or in one relation or
at one place fair, at another time or in another relation or at another place
foul, as if fair to some and foul to others; ... but Beauty absolute,
self-sufficient, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and without
increase, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing beauties
of all other things. He who from these ascending under the influence of true
love, begins to perceive that Beauty, is not far from the end. And the true
order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin
from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other Beauty,
using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all
fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to
fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute
Beauty, and at last knows what the essence of Beauty is.
