I declared this imperishable Yoga to Vivasv창n, and Vivasv창n told it to
Manu. Manu taught it to Ikshv창ku.

Thus, handed down in regular succession, the royal sages knew it. This
Yoga through long lapse of time has been lost in this world, O
Parantapa.

That same ancient Yoga has been today declared to thee by Me. for thou
art my devotee and my friend. This is the supreme secret.
