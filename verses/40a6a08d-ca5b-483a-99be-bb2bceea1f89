I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her
hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornicationï¼š

And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BAByON THE GREAT,
THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
