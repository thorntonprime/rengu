Would you know whence it is that so many false spirits have appeared
in the world, who have deceived themselves and others with false fire
and false light, laying claim to information, illumination and
openings of the divine Life, particularly to do wonders under
extraordinary calls from God? It is thisï¼š they have turned to God
without turning from themselves; would be alive to God before they are
dead to their own nature. Now religion in the hands of self, or
corrupt nature, serves only to discover vices of a worse kind than in
nature left to itself. Hence are all the disorderly passions of
religious men. which burn in a worse flame than passions only employed
about worldly matters; pride, self-exaltation, hatred and persecution,
under a cloak of religious zeal, will sanctify actions which nature,
left to itself, would be ashamed to own.
