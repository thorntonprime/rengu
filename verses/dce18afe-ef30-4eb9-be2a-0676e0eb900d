Title: When the Wind Takes a Tree in Its Arms
---
Three-quarters of the world dances all night, the waves moving as they do on
  the seas.

And when the wind takes a tree in its arms, what happens then?

The green branches of the earth may seem to reach out to touch us if we near
  them in a forest, a meadow, a field.

Does not all sway to a rhythm that began long before we stood upright?

We are in the mountain's home, just guests. Guests of the sky, the streams, the
  giving soil we nurse from.

Would not you be happier following their example -- bowing in unseen ways, then
  rising up?
