\"He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who
dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is
dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even
try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a
dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we know that
this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake,
busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man
ruler, that one herdsman - how dense! Confucius and you are both
dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too. Words
like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten thousand
generations, a great sage may appear who will know their meaning, and
it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.
