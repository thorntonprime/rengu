The divine understanding beholding all things most clearly, must needs beget
the greatest freedom that may be; which freedom, as it is bred in it. so it
never moves without the compass of it. And though the divine will be not
determined always to this or that particular, yet it is never bereft of
eternal light and truth to act by： and therefore, though we cannot see a
reason for all God’s actions, yet we may know they were neither done against
it, nor without it.
