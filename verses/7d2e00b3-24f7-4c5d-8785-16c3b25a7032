  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
For me everything disintegrated into parts, these parts again into parts;
no longer would anything let itself be encompassed by one idea. Single words
floated around me; they congealed into eyes which stared at me and into
which I was forced to stare back -- whirlpool which gave me vertigo and,
reeling incessantly, led me into the void.
