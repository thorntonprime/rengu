Title: I Love the Dark Hours
Description: May 8
Format: Verse

I love the dark hours of my being.
My mind deepens into them.
There I can find, as in old letters,
the days of my life, already lived,
and held like a legend, and understood.

Then the knowing comesï¼š I can open
to another life that's wide and timeless.
