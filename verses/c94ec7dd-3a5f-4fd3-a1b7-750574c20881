He only is able to declare with spirit and power any truths or bear a faithful
testimony of the reality of them who preaches nothing but what he has first
seen and felt and found to be true by a living sensibility and true experience
of their reality and power in his own soul.  All other preaching, whether from
art, hearsay, books, or education, is, at best, but playing with words and mere
trifling with sacred things.
