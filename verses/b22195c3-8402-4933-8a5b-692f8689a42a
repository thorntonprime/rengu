O truly blessed night, that alone was worthy to know the time and the hour when
Christ rose again from the dead. This is the night of which it is writtenï¼š And
the night shall be enlightened like day; and the night is my enlightening in my
pleasures. The sanctification of this night, therefore, driveth away evil
deeds, cleanseth offences, restoring innocence to the fallen and gladness to
the mournful. It driveth out hatred, it produceth concord and curbeth
tyrannies.
