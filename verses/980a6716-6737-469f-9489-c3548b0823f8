Title: Rain
---
Rain has the greatest power and offers the best opportunities.
Rain blocks the sun, the sky, and others’ prying eyes --
  but not the lightning or rainbow.

I became a lightning bolt and rode the rainbow to you
 for love’s embrace.
If I quietly come on a rainy day and bring home your silence,
 your lover will never know.
If you come on a rainy day, I’ll send you a coat of lotus leaves.
If you come wearing the coat on a rainy day,
 no one in the world will know.
If you quietly come on a rainy day and take away my tears,
 it’ll be an eternal secret.
Rain has the greatest power and offers the best opportunities.
