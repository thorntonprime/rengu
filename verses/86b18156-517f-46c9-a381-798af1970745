Title: From a Dream, In the Outer Reaches of the Arctic
---
As
In a dream, I watch -- I am -- a body
Swimming effortlessly underwater
In a boundless tank with all the soothing
Azure beauty of the oceans, gently
Tossing fish -- as though to understand the
Pattern of some creature seeking food, then

Dipping many feet to yet another
Level, with the graceful gesture of an
Ankle -- as in faith to whales sounding,

Then releasing one more fish amidst the
Ambient wetness, rising once again -- as
If pursuing sinuous perfection,

Guided by an unseen circular path,
Floating upwards, falling, in an endless
Rhythm of restful deep blue ecstasy.
