It is said that the highest state of prayer is when the spirit leaves
the flesh and the world, and in the act of prayer, loses all matter
and all form. To maintain oneself unfailingly in this state, is in
reality to pray without cease.

Just as the body in dying is separated from all the goods of this
life, so does the spirit which dies at the summit of prayer likewise
quit all the representations that it has of the world. For without
dying this death, it could never find itself and live with God.
