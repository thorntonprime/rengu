“I was consoling a little girl who was sick and had much pain,” said
Mother. “I told her, ‘You should be happy that God sends you suffering,
because your sufferings are a proof that God loves you much. Your sufferings
are kisses from Iesus.’ ‘Then, Mother,’ answered the little girl,
‘please ask Jesus not to kiss me so much.'"
