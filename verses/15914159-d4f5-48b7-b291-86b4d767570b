Title: A Lantern
---
You are so subtle you can slip into my soul,
how would it be if you, for a time,
were living visibly here?

So hidden that you are hidden from hidden things,
you enter me, and my hiddenness
shines like a lantern.

You Solomon, who understands bird-language
and speaks it, what will you say now
through my mouth?

King whose bow no one can draw,
use me for an arrow.

Shams is the way I know God.
