Title: In The World Of Men

\"Words are like wind and waves; actions are a matter of gain and loss.
Wind and waves are easily moved; questions of gain and loss easily lead
to danger. Hence anger arises from no other cause than clever words and
one-sided speeches. When animals face death, they do not care what
cries they make; their breath comes in gasps and a wild fierceness is
born in their hearts. [Men, too,] if you press them too hard, are bound
to answer you with ill-natured hearts, though they do not know why they
do so. If they themselves do not understand why they behave like this,
then who knows where it will end?
