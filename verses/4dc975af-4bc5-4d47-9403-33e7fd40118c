Theoretical science is divided into two parts -- the historical and
the spiritual meaning; and the latter into three -- tropological,
allegorical, anagogical.  Tropology (morality) relates to the
improvement of morals; allegory to another signification than that of
the letter; anagogy by the spiritual conception rises to the most
sublime and secret things of the celestial mysteries. The four senses
may be expressed at once in the same image. Thus, for example,
Jerusalem literally may mean, the city of the Jews; allegorically, the
Christian Church; tropologically, the human soul; anagogically, the
celestial city.
