All faiths constitute a revelation of Truth but all are imperfect, and liable
to error. Reverence for other faiths need not blind us to their faults. We
must be keenlu alive to the defects of our own faith also, yet not leave it
on that account, but try to overcome those defects. Looking at all religions
with an equal eye, we would not only hesitate, but would think it our duty,
to blend into our faith every acceptable feature of other faiths.
