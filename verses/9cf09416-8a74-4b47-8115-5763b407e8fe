Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find yourself beautiful
yet, act as does the creator of a statue that is to be made beautiful; he
cuts away here, he smooths there, he makes this line lighter, this other
purer, until a lovely face has grown upon his work. So do you alsoï¼š cut
away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring light
to all that is overcast, labour to make all one glow of beauty and never
cease chiselling your statue, until there shall shine out on you from it
the godlike splendour of virtue, until you shall see the perfect goodness
surely established in the stainless shrine.
