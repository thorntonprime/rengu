The soul that enters into God owns neither time nor space nor anything
nameable to be expressed in words. But it stands to reason, if you consider
it, that the space occupied by any soul is vastly greater than heaven and
earth and God’s entire creation. I say more： God might make heavens and
earths galore yet these, together with the multiplicity of creatures he has
already made, would be of less extent than a single needle-tip compared with
the standpoint of a soul atoned in God.
