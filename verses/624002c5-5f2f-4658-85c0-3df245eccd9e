It's sad, this old place;
one side's collapsing, while the other just totters,
walls falling outward, away from the center,
the binding beams and rafters, just a pile of sticks
 now.
Roof tiles heaped like fallen leaves.
It's rot, just a matter of time ...
Leave it to the wind to bring it all down.
Raising the fallen is harder.
