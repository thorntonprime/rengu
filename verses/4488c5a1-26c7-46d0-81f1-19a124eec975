Title: Only a Love
---
My love is expanding.
It is a perfect parachute.
It is a click breathed out and
  its chest becomes enormous.
My love doesn't rumble
      doesn't cry out
      doesn't beg
      doesn't laugh.
Its body is an eye.
Its skin is an atlas.
My words perforate the
      final sign of his name.
My kisses are eels he's
      proud to let slip away.
My caresses are streams reminiscent
      of music above the fountains of Rome.
No one could flee its emotional territories.
There are no routes nor folds nor insects.
Everything so terse that my tears have revolted.
My creation is all sanctimonious next
      to its own blonde boar.
At times like this the inkwell takes flight and
      makes its way to the inextinguishable borders
      where mosquitoes are making love.
There goes the fateful sound. I won't be back.
It is my love that is expanding.
