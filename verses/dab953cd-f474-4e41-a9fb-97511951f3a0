The person who believes in God, then, sees in the fact that right must prevail
an experience of what is above humanity, an experience of transcendence,
in other words, he experiences the absolute and saving presence of God in
that confusion of meaning and non-sense that we call â€œhuman existence."
we didn't know about, and we find things that contradict what we already
know. This is a sign of reality that is beyond our knowledge, our will, our
intention, and our desire, as well as being beyond what we have created. The
feeling that has arisen from the consideration of all this is that we
exist in a vast, illimitable reality out of which we emerged, probably,
as suggested by scientific evidence, through a process of evolution. But,
of course, religious people say it came from God. Whichever assumption we
make, we are here in this reality; we are participating in it.
