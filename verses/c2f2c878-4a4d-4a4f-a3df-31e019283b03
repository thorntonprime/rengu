Title: I Bet We Can Figure Something Out
---
How many times do you need to hear who you are before you begin to
cash some of that in and stop acting like a beggar ... for any kind of
attention from people who do not really love you?

Sweeping the streets the way that some do, with eyes that might covet,
is no longer fitting to us. For we are everything's lord.

There is no pride on my face, just the opposite. For I got to this
great position in making myself ready every moment to serve another.

All the alertness any creature might know, all primal strength and
agility, I would use if we were nearâ€¦ to care for you in a way a
divine lion would its cub.

I don't want you to leave me and go back into any world that can
frighten. What can I do? I bet we can figure something out.
