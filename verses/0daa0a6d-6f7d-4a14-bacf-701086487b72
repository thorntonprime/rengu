Title: Heaven And Earth

The border guard said, "At first I took you for a sage. Now I see you
are a mere gentleman. When Heaven gives birth to the ten thousand
people, it is certain to have jobs to assign them. If you have many
sons and their jobs are assigned them, what is there to fear? If you
share your riches with other men, what troubles will you have? The true
sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in
flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins
in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way,
he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand
years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and ascend to the
immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village
of God. The three worries you have cited never touch him, his body is
forever free of peril. How can he suffer any shame?"
