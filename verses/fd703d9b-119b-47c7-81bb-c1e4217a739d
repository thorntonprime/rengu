You are the content of your consciousness; in knowing yourself you will
know the universe. This knowing is beyond the word for the word is not
the thing. The freedom from the known, every minute, is the essence of
intelligence. It's this intelligence that is in operation in the universe if
you leave it alone. You are destroying this sacredness of order through the
ignorance of yourself. This ignorance is not banished by the studies others
have made about you or themselves. You yourself have to study the content
of your own consciousness.
