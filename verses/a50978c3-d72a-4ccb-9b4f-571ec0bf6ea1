The spirit of meditation is the combating of self-willed thinking -- it is
a combat against the weight of oneâ€™s feelings. It is a combat against
dark and deep sleepiness. It is a combat against the ideas of right and
wrong, of activity and quiet, or disorder and regularity -- in fact it is
a combat against all the forms of the objective world of the senses -- the
condition which dulls the mind. By carrying on the combat with enthusiasm
in the correct spirit, one may go on till there is an entirely unexpected
attainment of enlightenment.
