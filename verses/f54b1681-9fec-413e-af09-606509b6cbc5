The character mu is from the koan “Mu,” found in several koan
collections. It is Case I in the Book of Equanimity, Case 114 in the True
Dharma Eye, and Case I -- in an abbreviated version -- in The Gateless
Gate. In the Rinzai school of Zen this koan is one of several first koans
that practitioners work with.

A monk once asked master Zhaozhou. “ Has a dog the Buddha nature or not?"

Zhaozhou said. “mu."

The student is asked to concentrate with the whole body and mind on this
mu making it one great inquiry. Dualistic or nihilistic rationalizations
are not acceptable. The only way to see mu is to be mu with the whole body
and mind, and the only way to be mu is to cast away all discriminating
knowledge and consciousness. Kojima Kendo Roshi has combined mu with
a universal symbol -- the circle -- that expresses the totality ofour
being. The enso points to the most vital aspect of our existence, its
ultimate wholeness. In a sense, these two vital symbols are point ing
to a single reality. However, the question remains, what is that single
reality? Don't tell me, show me.
