Title: Nests in Your Palm
Description: July 3
---
What makes the wings return in the spring, I know all about.
And what makes them leave again before the snow weighs down their need for
 flight? That feeling too I am very familiar with.
Look at your own migration from spirit to form and back, so many times.
What is there to learn before you can retire and cease such an arduous journey?
Even His son was here to sweat and fast, and to work with his hands, and draw
 from a well and quench the thirst of myriad shapes.
Until you discover heaven nests in your palm, you will keep traveling in
 widening circles,
in exploration from spirit to form, until there is that deep Ahhh inside, and
 then nowhere else you will want to go.
Students then might gather, wanting to imbibe your ways.
