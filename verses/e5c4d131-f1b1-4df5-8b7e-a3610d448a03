Title: Every Day I Kill Isaac
---
Every day I get some idea of what is in myself, when I have to swallow my own
ideas about chant, the interior lite, solitude, the Cistercian vocation, etc,
etc, Every day I kill Isaac -- my beautiful dream about a silent, solitary,
well-ordered life of perfect contemplation and perfect monastic observance,
with no intrusion from the world, no publicity, no best-selling books, just
God and that nice, archaic little Carthusian cell!! I have to make that
blind act of faith that God and our Lady are drawing me -- per crucem --
through the Cross -- to something better, which I will probably never see
this side of heaven.

At the beginning of May, I think： our Lady is coming gradually to be
the whole of my interior life, The more I leave everything to her, the
simpler everything becomes, and the easier I travel, And this morning
I was reading marvelous things in Adam of Perseigne about Mary being "
the way.” She is that, Through her we come quickly to -- eyerything.

At Mass I have hardly been able to think of anything but our Lady, Either
that, or else I sink down into the depths where God is round alone, But to
do that is to be occupied implicity with her, for she is the way there,
Yet I do not say I do all this easily -- I am surrounded by distractions
and yet drawn into this love of her in spite of them.

More and more I abandon anything of my own that might seem to be
a “technique” of prayer and throw myself upon her mercy, leaving
myself to be moved and guided by her, certain that she alone, by God‘s
dispensation and decree, can help my helplessness.
