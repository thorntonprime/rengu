Acts are small; the Principle is great. Acts are various; the Principle is
one. Those who live the Principle, who let its meaning flow through their
very bloodstream, never act at variance with it. In whatever they do, they
fulfill the Principle. Whether busy or at ease they are never deceitful,
never manipulative. They have no hidden motives and need none.
