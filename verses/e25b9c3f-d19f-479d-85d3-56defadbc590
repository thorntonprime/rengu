Out here in the woods
I can think of nothing but God.
It is not so much that I think of Him
as I am aware of Him
as I am of the sun and the clouds
and the blue sky and the thin cedar trees.

Engulfed in the simple and lucid actuality of the afternoon --
I mean God's afternoon --
this sacramental moment of time
when the shadows will get longer and longer,
and on small bird sings quietly in the cedars,
one car goes by in the remote distance,
and the oak leaves move in the wind.

High up in the summer sky
I watch the silent flight of a vulture,
and the day goes by in prayer.
This solitude confirms my call to solitude.
The more I am in it,
the more I love it.
One day it will possess me entirely
and no man will ever see me again.
