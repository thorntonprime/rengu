The Tincture changes everything it is mixed with into its own nature, and
makes it white both within and without. By one operation and way, by one
substance, and by one mixing, the whole work is accomplished, while its
purity is also one, and it is perfected in two stag√®s, each consisting of
a dissolution and a coction, with the repetition of these.

It must be your first object to elicit the whiteness of the substance
by means of gentle and continued coction or heat. I know that the Sages
describe this simple process under a great number of misleading names. But
this puzzling variety of nomenclature is only intended to veil the fact that
nothing is required but simple coction. This process of coction, however,
you must patiently keep up, and that with the Divine permission, until the
King is crowned, and you receive your great reward.
