Title: If I hope to know You
---
If I hope to know You

I must seek an unknowing
that is not a lack but

my only gain, taking me
beyond the press

of demands and desires
to an emptiness

where there is room for
You to be born

beyond all that I demand
to know and desire

to find, for You birth
the Word in

my silence and burn
as light in

my darkness.
