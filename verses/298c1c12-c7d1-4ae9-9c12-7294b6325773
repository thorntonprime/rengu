Jesus Christ Himself saith that we should pray always and not faint or be
weary, and St. Paul wills that we pray without ceasing.

But it is only the state of faith which can make prayers incessant. Thus
Abraham (the father of the faithful, and the man who had the greatest faith
that ever was) was therein confirmed, so he called on the name of God in
all places. For as he kept himself in a continual state of prayer, so he
left tokens of his prayers, worship and offerings, in all places behind him.
