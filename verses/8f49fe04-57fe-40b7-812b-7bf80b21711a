Title: There Would Be Fewer Bird Songs
---
There would be fewer bird songs if our perceptions were greater, less calling
 out in need, less offering praise; no more seeking noises.
Probably more than half the tunes, the sounds you make, could retire when
 one's
Beloved is discovered within an easy reach.
If your left hand began to publicly thank your right for helping it with a
 task, or bringing about some comfort to you or family, that would be a sign
 you needed professional help.
Someday, for doing meditation, prayer or yoga in a crowd they might just
 cart you off to the nut house. I will come visit you though, and help you
 learn about being invisible, and silent.
We were torn from the throne where we sat, all we do is a trying to restore
 ourselves. There are people like Attar in this world who carry a thousand
 crowns in each pocket wanting to bless, sanction, our many stages, stations,
 on the path.
