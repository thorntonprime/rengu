When no one fears the awesome,
then how great it will appear.

Set no limit on their homes.
Lay no burden on their work.
Without duress, they never weary of you.

The person of integrity
knows himself, yet does not show himself.
He fills himself, yet is not full of himself.
He releases what is without
for what is within.
