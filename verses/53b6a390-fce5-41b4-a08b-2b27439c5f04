Title: On Not Going Crazy for Christ
---
I have been reading about de Rance, that old Trappist business of trying to
starve and beat your way to sanctity and of assuming that your own efforts
and energy are practically everything -- beating your head against a brick
wall at the end of a dead end in order to fulfill some particular negative
ideal. Our Cistercian Fathers and St. Benedict knew better. So did the Little
Flower. So did our Lord.

I don’t know any universal solution to the problem of why monks go crazy,
except yesterday it was such a beautiful day, and I walked under the trees
and looked at the sunny hills, and listened to the quiet sunlight, and kicked
the gravel with my feet and said, “What is there to go crazy about?”
We have a wonderful vocation. Christ has brought us here to live： to live
and breathe and be happy under His gaze, to play in His sight like children,
while He takes care of us -- to sing and fast and pray and (for me) to write
books and to love all the time. It’s not an effort; there is nothing to get
excited about. Sure, I am distracted, I am vain, I am full of dumb books,
and I get into interior arguments about the chant, so what? He knows I
don’t want to get into all that stuff, and He loves me.

I am happy that I can at least want to love God. Perhaps that is all I’ve
got, but it is already all that is essential. And He will take care of
the rest.
