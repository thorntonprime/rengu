To say as some have said, If God is all love towards fallen man, how can He
threaten or chastise sinners? is no better than saying. If God is all
goodness in Himself and towards man, how can He do that in and to man which
is for his good? ... It is love alone in the holy Deity that will allow no
peace to the wicked, nor ever cease its judgments till every sinner is forced
to confess that it is good for him that he has been in trouble, and
thankfully own that not the wrath but the love of God has plucked out that
right eye, cut off that right hand, which he ought to have done but would not
do for himself and his own salvation.
