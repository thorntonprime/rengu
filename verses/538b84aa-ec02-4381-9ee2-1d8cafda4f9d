If you, my son, wish to prepare this precious Stone, you need not put
yourself to any great expense. All that you want is leisure, and some
place where you can be without any fear of interruption. Reduce the
Matter (which is one) to powder, put it, together with its water, in a
well-closed vessel, and expose it to continuous, gentle heat, which
will then begin to operate, while the moisture favours the
decomposition. ... Kindle the fire of the Sages, and watch it well so
that there may be no smoke. The rest you may leave to me (Nature).
