Sublimity (uluww) belongs to God alone. The essences (a'y√¢n) of things are in
themselves non-existent, deriving what existence they possess from God, who is
the real substance Cayn) of all that exists. Plurality consists of relations
(nisab), which are non-existent things. There is really nothing except the
Essence, and this is sublime (transcendent) for itself, not in relation to
anything, but we predicate of the One Substance a relative sublimity
(transcendence) in respect of the modes of being attributed to it. ... The
Substance is One, although its modes are different. None can be ignorant of
this, for every man knows it of himself, and Man is the image of God The world
of Nature is many forms in One Mirror; nay. One Form in diverse mirrors.
Bewilderment arises from the difference of view, but those who perceive the
truth of what I have stated are not bewildered.
