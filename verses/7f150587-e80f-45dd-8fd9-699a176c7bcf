Title: Moments of Angelic Lucidity
---
I went down to the spring that feeds the stream running through Edelin's
pasture. Wonderful clear water pouring strongly out of a cleft in the mossy
rock. I drank from it in my cupped hands and suddenly realized it was years,
perhaps twenty-ffive or thirty years, since I had tasted such water, no
chemicals!! I looked up at the clear sky and the tops of the leafless trees
shining in the sunï¼š it was a moment of angelic lucidity. Said Tierce with
great joy, overflowing joy, as if the land and woods and spring were all
praising God through me. THe sense of angelic transparency of everything,
and of pure, simple, and total light. The word that comes closest to pointing
to it is simple. It was all simple. But a simplicitv to which one seems
to aspire, only seldom to attain. A simplicity, that is, that has and says
everything just because it is simple.
