Title: Holy Spirit

When you feel that sweetness,
that immeasurable sweetness,
a rich abundance surrounding you,
even and especially if you have nothing at all,
don't look aroundï¼š it is your heart that is full.
It is your soul flowing into and out of itself,
through grace with force, and
then, only then, will you be who you are inside.
Jesus has come with the power
of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
