Title: Into Your Undies
---
How long will you remain content just to hear and tell stories of what
happens beyond your horizons,

where the courageous had no choice but to live their ideals and imbibe
effulgence's shape?

Restlessness and a lack of peace can play a vital part in your inner
unfoldment.

If you ever become too complacent, too accepting of your sorrow or
shadow self,

the moon might fling a beehive into your undies and that should wake
you up.
