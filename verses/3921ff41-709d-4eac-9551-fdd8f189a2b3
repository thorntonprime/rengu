The strategists say：
‘It’s rash to play the host： I prefer to play the guest.
It’s rash to go forward an inch, I retreat a foot instead.’
This is known as advancing without moving,
Rolling up one’s sleeve without an arm,
Meeting an enemy by force without an enemy,
And waging war without a battle.
There’s nothing worse than treating war lightly.
Doing that will lose me all my treasure.
When two opponents encounter each other,
The one that is most regretful will win.
