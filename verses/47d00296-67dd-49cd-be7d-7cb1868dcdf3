Commentary: In Islamic esoterism it is said that one who presents himself
  at a certain "gate", without having reached it by a normal and
  legitimate way. sees it shut in his face and is obliged to turn back,
  but not as a mere profane person, for he can never be such again, but
  as a sàher (a sorcerer or a magician working in the domain of subtle
  possibilities of an inferior order)' (Guenon： The Reign o f Quantity,
  p. 3 17： tr. Lord Northbourne).

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man. he walketh through dry
places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out：
and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and they enter in and dwell there： and the last state
of that man is worse than the first.
