Meekness in itself is nought else but a true knowing and feeling of a
man’s self as he is.  For surely, whoso might verily see and feel
himself as he is, he should verily be meeked.  Two things there be
that be causes of this meekness, the which be these： One is the filth,
the wretchedness, and the frailty of man, into the which he is fallen
by sin, and the which he must always feel in some degree the whiles he
liveth in this life, be he never so holy.  Another is the
over-abundant love and the worthiness of God in himself; in beholding
of which all nature quaketh, all clerks be fools, and all saints and
angels be blind. Insomuch, that were it not, through the wisdom of his
Godhead, that he measured their beholding according to their ableness
in nature and in grace, I cannot say what should befall them.
