Title: Submission
---
Others love their freedom, but I prefer submission.
It’s not that I don’t know freedom,
I just want to submit to you.
Willing submission is sweeter than exalted freedom.

If you tell me to submit to someone else,
that’s the only thing to which I can’t submit.
If I submit to someone else, I can’t submit to you.
