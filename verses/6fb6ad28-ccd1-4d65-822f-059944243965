All that is sweet, delightful, and amiable in this world, in the serenity of
the air, the fineness of seasons, the joy of light, the melody of sounds, the
beauty of colours, the fragrancy of smells, the splendour of precious stones,
is nothing else but Heaven breaking through the veil of this world, manifesting
itself in such a degree and darting forth in such variety so much of its own
nature.
