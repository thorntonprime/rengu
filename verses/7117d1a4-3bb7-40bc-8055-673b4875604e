Sweet do the winds become unto him who desires to abide by the Moral
Law; sweet do the streams flow for him; even so, may the herbs be
sweet unto us; may night be sweet and dawn also sweet unto us; may the
region of Earth be sweet and also Heaven, our father; may the sylvan
god be sweet unto us; may the sun be sweet; and sweet may our kine
become.
