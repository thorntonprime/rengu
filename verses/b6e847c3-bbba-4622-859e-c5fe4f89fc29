Title: One Power
Commentary: |
  Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to
  withhold? “Once upon a time,” maybe, in the days of myth and legend,
  as a pattern, a model, an ideal?

  The knowledge and the ignorance or unknowing Lao Tzu speaks of may or may
  not refer to what we think of as education. In the last stanza, by power
  he evidently does not mean political power at all, but something vastly
  different, a unity with the power of the Tao itself.

  This is a mystical statement about government-and in our minds those two
  realms are worlds apart. I cannot make the leap between them. I can only
  ponder it.

Once upon a time
those who ruled according to the Way
didn’t use it to make people knowing
but to keep them unknowing.

People get hard to manage
when they know too much.
Whoever rules by intellect
is a curse upon the land.
Whoever rules by ignorance
is a blessing on it.
To understand these things
is to have a pattern and a model,
and to understand the pattern and the model
is mysterious power.

Mysterious power
goes deep.
It reaches far.
It follows things back,
clear back to the great oneness.
