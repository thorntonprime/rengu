All bodies are not impediments to beatitude, but only the corruptible,
transitory, and mortal ones; not such as God made man at first, but such as
his sin procured him afterwards.

Oh, but, they say, an earthly body is either kept on earth, or carried to
earth by its natural weight, and therefore cannot be in heaven. The first
men indeed were in a woody and fruitful land, which was called paradise. But
because we must resolve this doubt, seeing that both Christ’s body is
already ascended, and that the saints at the resurrection shall do so also,
let us ponder these earthly weights a little. If man’s art out of a metal,
that being put into the water sinks, can yet frame a vessel that shall swim,
how much more credible is it for God’s secret power, whose omnipotent will,
as Plato says, can both keep things produced from perishing, and parts combined
from dissolving (whereas the combination of corporeal and incorporeal is
a stranger and harder operation than that of corporals with corporals), to
take all weight from earthly things, whereby they are carried downwards, and
to qualify the bodies of the blessed souls, so that, though they be terrene,
yet they may be incorruptible, and fit to ascend, descend, or use what motion
they will with all celerity. Or if the angels can transport bodily weights
whither they please, must we think they do it with toil and feeling the
burden? Why then may we not believe that the perfect spirits of the blessed
can carry their bodies whither they please, and place them where they please?
