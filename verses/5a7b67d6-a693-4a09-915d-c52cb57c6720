We have nothing for our portion but pride and blindness of spirit,
hardness of heart, weakness and inconstancy of soul, concupiscence,
revolted passions, and sicknesses in the body. We are naturally
prouder than peacocks, more groveling than toads, more vile than
unclean animals, more envious than serpents, more gluttonous than
hogs, more furious than tigers, lazier than tortoises, weaker than
reeds, and more capricious than weathercocks. We have within
ourselves nothing but nothingness and sin. and we deserve nothing but
the anger of God and everlasting hell.

He who is infinite Wisdom, does not give commandments without reason,
and He has commanded us to hate ourselves only because we so richly
deserve to be hated. Nothing is worthier of love than God and nothing
is worthier of hatred than ourselves.

In order to rid ourselves of self, we must die to ourselves daily.
That is to say. we must renounce the operations of the powers of our
soul, and of the senses of our body. We must see as if we saw not,
understand as if we understood not. and make use of the things of this
world as if we made no use of them at all. This is what St Paul calls
dying daily.
