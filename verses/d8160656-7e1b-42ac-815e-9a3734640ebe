Title: A Preposterous Guess
---
Friend, you change what I lost
to a surprise gift.

You open my mouth in desire
and hand me the key.

A strange preposterous guess
seems righter and righter.

I let other fictions go.
I am the contents of your seed bag.
Scatter me over the ground.

Let me be the quiet
in the middle of the noise.
