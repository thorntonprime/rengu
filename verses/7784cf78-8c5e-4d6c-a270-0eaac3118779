Why does not the soul take wing, when from the glorious Presence
A speech of sweet favour comes to it, saying,'Aloft'?
How should a fish not leap nimbly from the dry land into the water,
When the sound of waves reaches its ear from the cold ocean?
Why should a falcon not fly from the quarry towards the King,
When it hears by drum and drum-stick the notice of"Return"?
Why should not every Sufi begin to dance, like a mote,
In the sun of eternity, that it may deliver him from decay?
Such grace and beauty and loveliness and bestowal of life!
O misery and error, if any one dispense with Him!
Fly, fly, O bird, to thy native home,
For thou hast escaped from the cage, and thy pinions are outspread.
Travel away from the bitter stream towards the water of life,
Return from the vestibule to the high seat of the soul.
Haste, haste! for we too, O soul, are coming
From this world of severance to that world of union.
O how long shall we, like children, in the earthly sphere
Fill our lap with dust and stones and sherds?
Let us give up the earth and fly heavenwards,
Let us flee from childhood to the banquet of men.
Behold how the earthly frame has entrapped thee!
Rend the sack and raise thy head clear.
Take from Love this scroll with thy right hand;
Thou art no child, not to know thy right from thy left.
God said to Reason's messenger,'Begone,'
To the hand of Death he said,'Chastise worldly desire.'
A voice came to the spirit,'Spirit thee away to the Unseen,
Take the gain and the treasure and lament the pain no more.,
Cry out and proclaim that thou art King;
Thine is the grace of answer, and thine is the knowledge of question.
