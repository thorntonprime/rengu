In the city, the moth-browed girl,
her jade pendants like tiny wind chimes chiming.
She is playing with a parrot in the flowers;
she is playing on her p'i-p'a in the moonlight.
Her songs will echo for three months;
a little dance will draw ten thousand watchers.
Nothing lasts as, long as thisï¼š
beautiful face of the hibiscus,
can't bear the frost's caress.
