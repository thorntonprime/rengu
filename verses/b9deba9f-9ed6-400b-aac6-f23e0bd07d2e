Title: In The World Of Men
---
There's Crippled Shu - chin stuck down in his navel, shoulders up above
his head, pigtail pointing at the sky, his five organs on the top, his
two thighs pressing his ribs. By sewing and washing, he gets enough to
fill his mouth; by handling a winnow and sifting out the good grain, he
makes enough to feed ten people. When the authorities call out the
troops, he stands in the crowd waving good-by; when they get up a big
work party, they pass him over because he's a chronic invalid. And when
they are doling out grain to the ailing, he gets three big measures and
ten bundles of firewood. With a crippled body, he's still able to look
after himself and finish out the years Heaven gave him. How much
better, then, if he had crippled virtue!
