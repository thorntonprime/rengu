Far, so far, the mountain path is steep.
Thousands of feet up, the pass is dangerous and
 narrow.
On the stone bridge, moss and lichen ...
from time to time, a sliver of cloud flying ...
and cascades hanging, skeins of silk.
Image of the moon from the deep pool, shining,
once more to the top of Flowering Peak,
there waiting, still
the coming of the solitary crane.
