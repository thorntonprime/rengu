This being (Ens) is drawn from the eternal, but the conglomerate of the four
elements is taken from time. ...

And although the elementary conglomerate, the body (which the being has
assumed or projected as an exterior degree) passes and is annihilated (for
it has a beginning in time), the first being does not pass; as appears in
the fact that all things are reabsorbed again into the Mother from whence
they are issued and born, that is to say into the four elements.
