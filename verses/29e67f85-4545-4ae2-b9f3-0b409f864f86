Title: The Silence in Yourself
---
Yesterday it looked like snow. Today there is deep snow, and the sun is out, and
the cedars full of snow stand up against a bright blue sky and the white hills
are in a sort of haze and the abbey buildings are golden. That is the way
Gethsemani looks in winter and Frater Linus's box of Kodachormes is full of just
such pictures.

Yesterday, when I was reading in the cemetery, I thought how the silence you
find in yourself, whenever you enter in and rest in God, is always the same and
always new, even though it is unchanging. For that silence is true life and,
even though your body moves around (as mine did vigorously, being cold), your
soul stays in the same place, resting in its life Who is God, now in winter just
as it did before in summer, without any apparent difference, as if nothing had
changed at all, and the passage of seasons had only been an illusion.

For the first time since the beginning of December, I went out to work to let
some fresh air into my stuffy head and let a few phantasms fly away into the
trees. We broke rock down on the road to the lower bottom, outside the
enclosure, past the horse barn. How good it was to be out working with my
brothers! And I felt this even about those who ordinarily rub me the wrong way!
How good it is to have a rule in which simplicity and poverty and hardship play
so large a part so that you can give yourself up to God by it!
