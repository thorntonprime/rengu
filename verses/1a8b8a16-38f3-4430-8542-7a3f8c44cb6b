Commentary: The 'yin district' is the substantial, ephemeral pole of
  existence, domain of the fugitive soul which has to be bridled and
  brought under control if the 'great medicineâ€™ is to succeed.

If one does not perform good works and spread virtue in the yin
district, his work will be handicapped frequently by groups of devils.
