    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Bodily Delight
---
If only people could perceive the mystery in all life, down to the smallest
thing, and open themselves to it instead of taking it for granted. If only
they could revere its abundance which is undividedly both material and
spiritual. For the mind's creation springs from the physical, is of one
nature with it and only a lighter, more enraptured and enduring recapturing
of bodily delight.
