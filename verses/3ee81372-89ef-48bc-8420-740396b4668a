People crave sensory stimulation. They enjoy this kind of external
excitement. But I consider such craving a form of suffering. Sensory
stimulation feeds on itself, grows larger and larger, and develops an ever-
increasing appetite. People will destroy themselves and others, too, in
trying to satisfy it. Pleasure derived from Dharma wisdom is internal
excitement. Happiness grows along with the capacity to enjoy it. When given
a choice between enjoyments, enlightened people always choose the Dharma.
