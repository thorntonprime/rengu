Title: Love within Reach
---
Teach me to treasure the
measure of love that mends

the wound that bums night
and day, so that I may learn

that all who wish me ill are
a gift for me, and recall

that all the love in this life
is within reach only when

I let go of the circle of ill
and make room for the love

You ever want to instill.
