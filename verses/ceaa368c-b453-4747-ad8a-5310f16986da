Collect thirty spokes on a single hub.
In the empty space the usefulness lies.
Form a bowl from lumps of clay.
In the empty space the usefulness lies.
Frame your walls with windows and doors.
In the empty space the usefulness lies.

Soï¼š
Advantage comes from what is there,
usefulness from what is not.
