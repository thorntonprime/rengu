Title: Xuanshaâ€™s Three Maladies
---
Xuansha, instructing the assembly, said, In all
directions the sojourning-elders welcomed situations to aide the living
in the path leading to the destruction of suffering. If you
unexpectedly come to run into people with three kinds of maladies, how
do you make it alive to welcome them? With those who suffer from being
blind, if you pick up the mallet or stand up the whisk, the other, too,
does not see. With those who suffer from being deaf, about the samadhi
of language, the other, too, does not hear. With those who suffer from
being mute, if you instruct them to speak, again they are not able to
speak. Just how do you make it alive to welcome them? If youre not
able to welcome these people the Buddha Dharma is without verifiable
effect.

A monk requested augmentation from Yunmen. Yunmen said,
Set forth your ceremonial-respects.

The monk did the ceremonial obeisance and rose. Yunmen
used the staff to stab. The monk withdrew backwards.

Men said, Indeed, you do not suffer from being blind.

Again he called him to come near in front. The monk
neared in front.

Men said, Indeed, you do not suffer from being deaf.

Men thereupon said. Reply, what do you understand?

The monk said, I do not understand.

Men said, Indeed, you do not suffer from being mute.

The monk had introspection into this.

Stare.

Yawn.

Stab.
