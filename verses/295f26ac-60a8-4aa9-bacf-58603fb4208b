Title: The Voices
---
The rich and the happy can choose to keep silent,
no need to bid for attention.
But the desperate must reveal themselves,
must say： I am blind
or： I am going blind
or： It's not good for me here on Earth
or： My child is sick
or： I am not holding it together ...

But when is that really enough?
So, lest people pass them by like objects,
sometimes they sing.

And sometimes their songs are beautiful.
