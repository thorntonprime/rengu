Title: Tremendously More True
---
She had a dream that told her she was going to pass from this world.

And on the day before, she still felt well, but believed these were her last
hours, and come morning friends would be looking at her as she lay still, no
longer breathing.

She went into her garden as she always had before dark and spoke to the plants
as she would.

Never more beautiful did the world look, never more a part of everything she
now knew she was.

An assurance, some absolute certainty opened up in her and she knew any mortal
identifications one could have were such a small part of something tremendously
more true ... that awaited our knowing.

Her whole life she saw was like a slipper, often too tight, she had worn for a
long day, and did not now mind at all taking it off.

She lay down that night, then merged into a brilliant Sky -- someone could call
God, she found her soul had always, had always been holding in its hand.
