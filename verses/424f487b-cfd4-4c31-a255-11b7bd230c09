By: Porphyry
Commentary: |
  Explains the translator, 'The meaning of this twofold
  death is as follows： Though the body, by the death which is
  universally known, may be loosened from the soul, yet while material
  passions and affections reside in the soul, the soul will continually
  verge to another body, and as long as this inclination continues,
  remain connected with body. But when, from the predominance of an
  intellectual nature, the soul is separated from material affections,
  it is truly liberated from the body： though the body at the same time
  verges and clings to the soul, as to the immediate cause of its
  support.'

That which nature binds, nature also dissolves： and that which the
soul binds, the soul likewise dissolves. Nature, indeed, bound the
body to the soul; but the soul binds herself to the body. Nature,
therefore, liberates the body from the soul; but the soul liberates
herself from the body. Hence there is a twofold death; the one,
indeed, universally known, in which the body is liberated from the
soul; but the other peculiar to philosophers, in which the soul is
liberated from the body. Nor does the one entirely follow the other.
