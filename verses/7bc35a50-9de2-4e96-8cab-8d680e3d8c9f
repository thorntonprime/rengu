It isnâ€™t meant to be beautiful,
this image of a red car
sinking into the rising
New Jersey flood water

but the water
is blue and glassy
and the red car,
so silent.

I am sorry
if this is your car,
or the car of your friend,
or if it reminds you of the car you drove
during your second year of college,
named after a girl,
Jenny or Stella.

You could say
the car in the newspaper
is dying.
It will never again thrum and roar
down the entrance ramp to the New Jersey Turnpike
nor fight for a parking space
at the Vince Lombardi rest stop.

It is simply
a red island
in a small lake,

resplendent,
grand,
blue water rising and spreading around it
like a gown.
