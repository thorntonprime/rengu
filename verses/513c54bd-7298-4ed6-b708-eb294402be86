In tranquillity, in stillness, in the unconditioned, in inaction, we find the
levels of the universe, the very constitution of TAO. ...

Sorrow and happiness are the heresies of virtue; joy and anger lead astray
from TAO; love and hate cause the loss of virtue. The heart unconscious of
sorrow and happiness, -- that is perfect virtue. ONE, without change, -- that
is perfect repose.
