Life is a series of choices and as all ideas in this manifested universe
are divided as opposites, we can choose the negative ego approach or the
positive spiritual approach. ... From the negative ego approach we learn
that we will suffer until we balance our actions and bring our lives into
harmony with the laws that govern the universe. This is called the law of
hard knocks or karma. With the positive spiritual approach we choose to live
in obedience to Godâ€™s will, to live in harmony with universal laws without
being pushed into it. This can be called the school of grace.
