Title: The Skinned Knee Is Better Off
---
Since the Beloved is involved in everything, it has to be this way：

The skinned knee is better off for having ached.

And a face that has known a tear's movement, it may not show right
away any signs of change,

but a magnificent inner canyon is being formed from the currents of
sacred elements touching -- shaping us.

When will tenderness reign? When will love govern? There is a court
you rule that affects any you near, so you tell me.

Something became apparent a while back： Listening to others deeply is
vital to human development.

The heart cannot deny the law of action and reaction. It will give in
proportion to what it has cherished.

Some great thermal force is within us that can warm and comfort many.
Clever bargaining is legal on the path, it can help light come into
your possession. All is a means to God.

The skinned knee is better off for having yelped, but I consider where
I step so I do not trip upon or harm another.

The hand will give in proportion to what the eye has seen. So study my
face, share the bounty of other worlds in a look my countenance holds.
