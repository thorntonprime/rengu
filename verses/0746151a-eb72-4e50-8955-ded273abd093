Once in the season of spring she (Râbi'a al-'Adawiyya) went into her chamber
and bowed her head in meditation. Her handmaid said. ‘O mistress, come forth
that thou mayst behold the wondrous works of God!’ ‘Nay,’ she answered, ‘do
thou come within, that thou mayst behold their Maker. Contemplation of the
Maker hath turned me from contemplating that which He made.’
