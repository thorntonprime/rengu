Title: Nyoi
By: Torei Enji
Commentary:
  Toreii's bold brushwork fills this scroll with the form ofa nyoi (Ch： rui),
  a short scepter carried by Zen masters. It is usually carved From jade, bone,
  wood, or bamboo, and has the form ofa mushroom ofimmortality at the top --
  here depicted with three circular brushstrokes over the thick wriggling
  vertical. Torei added his inscription on the right, and his signature with
  its mysterious clamshell-shaped cipher on the lower left. But the question
  remains： What is this?
