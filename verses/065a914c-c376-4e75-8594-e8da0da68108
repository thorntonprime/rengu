Govern the state by being honest.
Wage war by being clever.
Achieve the realm by not meddling.
How do I know it is like that? By this：
The more regulations
The poorer the people.
The more sharp weapons
The more troubled the country.
The cleverer the people
The more distractions.
The wider the knowledge of law,
The more there are thieves and rogues.
So the wise say：
I take no action and the people transform themselves.
I remain still and the people set themselves right.
I don’t interfere and the people themselves prosper.
I am free of desires and the people of themselves
Hold to the un-carved block.
