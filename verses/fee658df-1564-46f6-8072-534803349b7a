Title: Bear with Me
---
I have no choice but to leave; bear with this parting.
When you go over the ridge, don’t look back.
My being is about to enter a grain of sand.

If you can’t bear with this parting, bear with my death.
My lifeboat is sinking in a sea of shame.
Blow, make it drown quickly, and be glad for it.

If you can’t bear my death, don’t favor me with love.
Instead, make yourself unloveable.
I’ll enter your heart and live in you.
Bear becoming one with me.
Love me not and I shall not love you.
