Our desert hath no bound,
Our hearts and souls have no rest.
World in world has ta'en Form's image;
Which of these images is ours?
When thou seest in the pathway a severed head,
Which is rolling toward our field,
Ask of it, ask of it, the secrets of the heartï¼š
For of it thou wilt learn our hidden mystery.
How would it be, if an ear showed itself,
Familiar with the tongues of our songsters?
How would it be, if a bird took wing,
Bearing the collar of the secret of our Solomon?
What shall I say, what think? for this tale
Is too high for our limited and contingent being.
How keep silence, when every moment
Our anguish grows more anguished?
Partridge and falcon alike are flying together
Mid the air of our mountain-land;
Mid an air which is the seventh atmosphere,
At the zenith whereof is our Saturn.
Are not the seven heavens below the empyrean?
Beyond the empyrean is our revolution.
What place here for aspirations toward the empyrean
and the sky?
Our journey is to the rose-garden of union.
Leave this tale..Ask not of us,
For our tale is wholly interrupted.
Salahu'lhaq u din will declare to thee
The beauty of our Sultan, the King of kings.
