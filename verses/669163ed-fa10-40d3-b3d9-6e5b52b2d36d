Title: Qinshan Shoots an Arrow
---
Zen traveler Liang asked Qinshan, So what about the time when one
arrowhead destroys three checkpoints?

Shan said, To see it, liberate and produce the host within the
checkpoints.

Liang said, Knowing in this way, then to pass across one must
transform.

Shan said, What time is there for further waiting?

Liang said, A well released arrow does not show the place it is at.
Then he exited.

Shan said, For the time being, come on instructor (acarya).

Liang turned back his head.

Shan held and stopped him and said, As it is for the time being, cease
with the One arrowhead destroys three checkpoints. Test it with
Qinshan (i.e., me) shoot an arrow and see.

While Liang was deciding what to discuss, Shan hit seven times with a
stick and said, Well wait for 30 years further with this fellows
doubt.
