Title: The Turning Of Heaven

Lao Tzu said, "It's lucky you didn't meet with a ruler who would try to
govern the world as you say. The Six Classics are the old worn-out
paths of the former kings - they are not the thing which walked the
path. What you are expounding are simply these paths. Paths are made by
shoes that walk them, they are by no means the shoes themselves!
