Title: But for You
---
But for you, why does this smooth, plump face fold into wrinkles?
But for missing you, I would be ageless until the end of time.
I would remain as we were in our first embrace.
Old age, sickness, death -- because of you I donâ€™t hate them.
Give me life or death as you will.
I am but you.
