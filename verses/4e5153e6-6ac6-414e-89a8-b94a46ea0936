\"Therefore the Great Man in his actions will not harm others, but he
makes no show of benevolence or charity. He will not move for the sake
of profit, but he does not despise the porter at the gate. He will not
wrangle for goods or wealth, but he makes no show of refusing or
relinquishing them. He will not enlist the help of others in his work,
but he makes no show of being self-supporting, and he does not despise
the greedy and base. His actions differ from those of the mob, but he
makes no show of uniqueness or eccentricity. He is content to stay
behind with the crowd, but he does not despise those who run forward to
flatter and fawn. All the titles and stipends of the age are not enough
to stir him to exertion; all its penalties and censures are not enough
to make him feel shame. He knows that no line can be drawn between
right and wrong, no border can be fixed between great and small. I have
heard it said, 'The Man of the Way wins no fame, the highest virtue
wins no gain, the Great Man has no self.' To the most perfect degree,
he goes along with what has been allotted to him."
