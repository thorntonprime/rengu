The mind becomes a blank sheet; then the yogi destroys this sheet and
becomes identified with the supreme Purusha, the Self, the supreme Being,
from whom the mind derives all its light. He thus obtains omniscience and
final emancipation (kaivalya). These are things which are so much Greek to
our Western psychologists; this is why they grope in darkness. They have no
idea of the perfect Being or Purusha, witness of the mindâ€™s activities.
