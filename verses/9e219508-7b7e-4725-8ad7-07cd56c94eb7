You should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith
will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa,
cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, ‘I
am practising “who am I” enquiry’ -- this is all wild imagination. Few
are fit for ‘who am I’ enquiry.
