Title: No More Drought
---
Today, let the rainclouds open --
Mira's Lord is at home.
Even the finest mists can fill the dry tanks,
And long searching has brought me my love.
No fear remains, no absence, no drought --
He has returned.
Mira says to her husband from previous lifetimes,
Even the cattle drink this rising water.
