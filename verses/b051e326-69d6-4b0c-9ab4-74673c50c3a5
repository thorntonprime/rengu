Title: Measure of Love
---
The more joy and beauty there is, the better.
But, it seems, the less of your love there is, the better.
Your love exists between you and me.
To know the quantity of love,
we can only measure the distance between us.
If the distance is great, then the degree of love is great;
if the distance is small, the degree of love is small.
So small love makes me smile, great love makes me cry.

Who says when a person goes far away,
that love also goes far?
If your absence makes love distant,
what is this crying day after day if not love?
