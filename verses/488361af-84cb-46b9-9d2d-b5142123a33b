Death, when we consider it closely, is the true goal of our existence. I have
formed during the last few years such close relations with this best and
truest friend of mankind, that this image is not only no longer terrifying
to me, but is indeed very soothing and consoling! And I thank my God for
graciously granting me the opportunity ... of learning that death is the
key which unlocks the door to our true happiness.
