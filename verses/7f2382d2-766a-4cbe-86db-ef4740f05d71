  - Person: Vâlmiki
    Description: Author of the Râmâyana
---
First realize God, then think of the creation and other things. Vâlmiki was
given the name of Râma to repeat as his mantra, but was told at first to repeat
'marâ'. 'Ma' means God and ‘râ’ the world. First God and then the world. If you
know one you know all. If you put fifty zeros after a one, you have a large
sum; but erase the one and nothing remains. It is the one that makes the many.
First one, then many. First God, then His creatures and the world.
