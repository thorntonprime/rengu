Look on the face of Love, that you may be properly a man.
Do not sit with the frigid; for you will be chilled by their breath.
Look from the face of Love something other than beauty;
It is time that you should consort with a sympathetic companion.
Since you are properly a clod, you will not rise into the air;
You will rise into the air, if you break and become dust.
If you break not, He who molded you will break you;
When death breaks you, how should you become a separate substance?
When the leaf grows yellow, the fresh root makes it green;
You are complaining of Love thro'which you become pale.
And, O friend, if you reach perfection in our assembly,
Your seat will be the throne, you will gain your desire in all things.
But if you stay many years more in this earth,
You will pass from place to place, you will be as the dice in backgammon.
If Shamsi Tabriz draws you to his side,
When you escape from captivity you will return to that orb.
