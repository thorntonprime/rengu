These two men (Enoch and Elias) who now came out of Paradise were so
wise in Divine Truth that they drove Anti-Christ powerfully away. They
told him straightly who he was, from what power his signs and wonders
came, how he had come from thence and what his end should be. As the
misled realized what an accursed god had been given them because of
their greed, and their delight in many kinds of evil, many good men
and women who had been turned from the Christian way turned back
again.
