When with Haste the Feind hath noe availe,
Then with Despaire your mind he will assaile
And oft present thhis Sentence to your minde.
How many seeken, and how few maie finde.
Of wiser Men then ever were yee：
What suretie than to you maie be：
He woll move ye to doubt also
Whether your Teacher had it or noe;
And also how it mought so fall,
That part he tought you but not all：
Such uncertainety he woll cast out.
To set your minde with greevous doubt：
And soe your Paines he woll repaire
With wann hope and with much Despaire：
Against this assault is no defence,
But only the vertue of Confidence：
To whome reason shulde you leade.
That you shall have noe cause to dreade：
If you wisely call to your minde
The vertuous manners, such as you finde
In your Master and your Teacher,
Soe shall you have noe neede to feare：
If you consider all Circumstances about.
Whether he tought you for Love or for Doubt：
Or whether Motion of him began.
For it is hard to trust such a Man：
For he that profereth hath more neede
Of you. then you of him to speede.
