Carpenter Shih went to Ch'i and, when he got to Crooked Shaft, he saw a
serrate oak standing by the village shrine. It was broad enough to
shelter several thousand oxen and measured a hundred spans around,
towering above the hills. The lowest branches were eighty feet from the
ground, and a dozen or so of them could have been made into boats.
There were so many sightseers that the place looked like a fair, but
the carpenter didn't even glance around and went on his way without
stopping. His apprentice stood staring for a long time and then ran
after Carpenter Shih and said, "Since I first took up my ax and
followed you, Master, I have never seen timber as beautiful as this.
But you don't even bother to look, and go right on without stopping.
Why is that?"
