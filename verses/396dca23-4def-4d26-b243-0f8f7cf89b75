The reason why River and Sea can be
The rulers of the hundred valleys
Is because they adopt the lower position.
So they can command the hundred valleys.
In order to command people
You should be humble with them.
If you want to lead people
You should follow behind.
So the wise command the people
But avoid being a burden.
They go in front of the people
But cause no obstruction.
Therefore the realm gladly upholds them,
And never resents doing so.
Because they do not contend
No one in the realm contends with them.
