Behind the barn was mystery,
The pine trees there were like the sea
When wind was up; but it was more
Than waves upon an unseen shore
That made the boy’s heart burn and sing.
He knew well there was a thing
In that spot which bound in one
All splendid things from sun to sun --
Amber jewels of roosters’ eyes,
The floating beads of golden flies,
The rainbow’s lintel of brief light
Arched across the door of night,
A duck’s white feather like a flower
On a pool left by a shower
The hot sound, steady, small, and keen,
Of August mowing by machine.
The cool sound of a scythe, the small
Madness of the cricket's call,
The sudden smell of apples in
October twilight from a bin,
The pleasure, lonely and immense,
Of the hearth-cat’s confidence.

The pines behind the barn somehow
Joined the lowing of a cow
To the moon that marched through crowds
Of angels of fair-weather clouds.
The pines possessed the ancient right
Of opening doorways in the night
To let the day and cockcrow through,
They built a fire in the dew.
Laid the hand of East in West’s,
Filled the eggs in robins’ nests.
With thunder rolling deep below
The earth at night, They mingled snow
Of Junetime daisies with December’s,
And built the roses in the embers.

It took a boy of ten to see
Such a tremendous unity.
