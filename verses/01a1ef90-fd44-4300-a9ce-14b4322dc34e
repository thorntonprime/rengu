Those who pursue money are always rushed, always busy with urgent matters.
Those who pursue the Dharma, go slow and easy. “Boring” you say? Maybe.
Maybe it’s downright dreary to stop and smell a flower or listen to a bird.
Maybe a glint of gold is really more dazzling than the sight of one’s
Original Face. Maybe what we need is a better definition of “treasure”.
