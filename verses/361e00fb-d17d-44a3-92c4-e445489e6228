Title: Love Flowers When It Is Obedient
---
Dawn is beginning (5：30) on a mild spring morning. Holy Week is about to
begin and I was never more conscious of its solemnity and its importance. I
am a Christian, and a member of a Christian community. I and my brothers
are to put aside everything else and recognize that we belong not to
ourselves but to God in Christ. That we have vowed obedience, which is
intended to unite us to Christ “obedient unto death -- even the death
of the Cross.”That without our listening and attention and submission,
in total selfrenunciation and love for the Father’s will, in union with
Christ, our life is false and without meaning. But in so far as we desire,
with Christ, that the Father’s will may be done in us, as it is in heaven
and in Christ, then even the smallest and most ordinary things are made
holy and great. And then in all things the love of God opens and flowers,
and our lives are transformed. This transformation is a manifestation and
advent of God in the world.

One of the fruits of a solitary life is a sense of the absolute importance
of obeying God -- a sense of the need to obey and to seek His will,
to choose freely to see and accept what comes from Him, not as a last
resort, but as one’s “daily super-substantial bread.” Liberation
from automatic obedience into the seriousness and gravity of a free choice
to submit. But it is not easy to see always where and how!
