Obj. But you will say; may we not enjoy the delights of the Creature, which
is an Inferiour Image?

Ans. Yes, as a Man may have a Conversation with many Women, so that he break
not the Marriage-Union. Thy Fountain must be thine own. All delights abroad
must be, as Streams of this Fountain, not divided Springs. All other Images
must be onely reflections of this One, & concentred in it.

Please thy self to the full with every Content. Only let it be no Cloud to
cut off; but a Christal to take in the Divine Glory, that this may be thine
and flame in them
