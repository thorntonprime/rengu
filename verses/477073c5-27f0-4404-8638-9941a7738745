Joshu once asked Nansen, ‘What is Tao (the Way)?’ Nansen answered,
‘Ordinary mind is Tao.’ ‘Then should we direct ourselves toward it
or not?’ asked Joshu. ‘If you try to direct yourself toward it, you
go away from it,’ answered Nansen. Joshu continued, ‘If we do not try,
how can we know that it is Tao?’ Nansen replied, ‘Tao does not belong to
knowing or to not-knowing. Knowing is illusion; not-knowing is blankness. If
you really attain to Tao of no-doubt, it is like the great void, so vast and
boundless. How, then, can there be right and wrong in the Tao?’ At these
words, Joshu was suddenly enlightened.

Commentary

Questioned by Joshu, Nansen immediately shows that the tile is disintegrating,
the ice is dissolving, and no communication whatsoever is possible. Even
though Joshu may be enlightened, he can truly get it only after studying
for thirty more years.Questioned by Joshu, Nansen immediately shows that

 Hundreds of flowers in spring, the moon in autumn,
 The cool breeze in summer and snow in winter;
 If there is no vain cloud in your mind,
 for you it is a good season.
