Now it may be asked, What is this nature of the soul? -- It is the consciousness
(the spark or synteresis) in the soul, that is the impartible nature of the
soul. So subtile is this nature of the soul that space might not exist at
all for all it troubles her. For instance, if one has a friend a thousand
leagues away, thither flows the soul with the best part of her powers,
loving her friend there. St Augustine testifies to this. He says, ‘The
soul is where she loves rather than where she is giving life.’ The simple
nature of the soul is in no way hampered by place.
