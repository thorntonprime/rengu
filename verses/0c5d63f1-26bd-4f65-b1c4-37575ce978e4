If pleasure comes, enjoy it.
Time's never an arrow to let miss the mark ...
We talk like we'll live to a hundred,
but who'll ever even get close?
Living in this worldï¼š just grasp a handful ...
And money? That's a word the autumn crickets
 choke on.
In the final chapter of the Classic of Dutiful
 Children,
we all learn the proprieties of burying our elders.
