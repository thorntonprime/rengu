I know perfectly well that success is impossible for me if I cannot write as
my heart dictates, free of any outside influence whatsoever, without having
to keep in mind that I’m writing for Paris and not for the inhabitants
of, say, the moon. Furthermore, the singers would have to sing as I wish,
not as they wish, and the chorus, which, to be sure, is extremely capable,
would have to show the same goodwill. A single will would have to rule
throughout： my own. That may seem rather tyrannical to you, and perhaps
it is. But if the work is an organic whole, it is built on a single idea
and everything must contribute to the achievement of this unity. You may
perhaps say that nothing stands in the way of all that in Paris. No! In
Italy it can be done, or at least I can always do it; but in France：
no. For example, if I come into the foyer of an Italian theater with a
new work, no one ventures to utter an opinion, to pass judgment, before
understanding everything thoroughly. And no one would even dare to make
inappropriate requests. There is respect for the work and for the composer,
and decisions are left to the public.

In the foyer of the Opera, on the other hand, everybody starts to whisper
after the first four chords： Oh, ce n’est pas bon ... C’est commun,
ce n’est pas de bon gout ... Ce n’ire pas a Paris. What do such
pitiable words as commun ... de bon gout ... Paris mean, if you’re
dealing with a real work of art, which should belong to the whole world!

The conclusion from all this is that I'm no composer for Paris.
