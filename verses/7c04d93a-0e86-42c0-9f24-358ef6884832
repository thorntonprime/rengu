You can’t be comfortable if you’ve got splinters in your skin. Worse, if
you don’t get them out, the skin becomes infected. Infected skin becomes
necrotic.

It’s the same with the heart. You can’t be comfortable if splinters of
greed are stuck in it. And if you don’t get them out, your heart becomes
infected. What will you do if your spirit dies?
