Devout men are the title and inscription of the Book of the Law. They are the
demonstration of all the truths, the solution of all the mysteries. Their
outward life bears us to the path of obedience; their hidden life wins us
to self-denial. They began their career before the ages, and they work for
eternity. They have effaced from their hearts and minds every trace of pride
and hypocrisy. They have trodden the ways of God, even when they appeared
powerless to move, so feeble were they. These are the friends of God; they
have discovered divine secrets; they guard them with devout silence.
