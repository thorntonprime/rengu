By: Eckhart

At various times I have declaredï¼š I am the cause that God is God. God is
gotten of the soul, his Godhead of himself; before creatures were. God was not
albeit he was Godhead which he gets not from the soul. Now when God finds a
naughted soul whose self and whose activity have been brought to naught by
means of grace. God works his eternal work in her above grace, raising her out
of her created nature. Here God naughts himself in the soul and then neither
God nor soul is left. Be sure that this is God indeed.
