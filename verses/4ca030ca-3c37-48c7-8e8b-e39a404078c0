We are glad because thou hast revealed thyself to us in all thy being; we
are glad because, while we are yet in the body, thou hast deigned to make
us gods by the gift of thine own eternal life. ...

We have learnt to know thee, O thou eternal constancy of that which stands
unmoved, yet makes the universe revolve.

With such words of praise do we adore thee, who alone art good; and let us
crave from thy goodness no boon save thisï¼š be it thy will that we be kept
still knowing and loving thee, and that we may never fall away from this
blest way of life.
