The entangled creatures, attached to worldliness, talk only of worldly
things in the hour of death. What will it avail such men if they
outwardly repeat the name of God, take a bath in the Ganges, or visit
sacred places? If they cherish within themselves attachment to the
world, it must show up at the hour of death. While dying they rave
nonsense. Perhaps they cry out in a delirium, ‘Turmeric powder!
Seasoning! Bay-leaf!’ The singing parrot, when at ease, repeats the
holy names of Râdhâ and Krishna, but when it is seized by a cat it
utters its own natural sound; it squawks, ‘Kaa! Kaa!’ It is said in
the Gîtâ that whatever one thinks in the hour of death, one becomes in
the after-life.
