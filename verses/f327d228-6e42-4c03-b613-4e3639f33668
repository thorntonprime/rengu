The people are hungry：
It is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes
That the people are hungry.
The people are difficult to govern.
It is because those in authority are too fond of action
That the people are difficult to govern.
The people treat death lightly：
It is because the people set too much store by life
That they treat death lightly.

It is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man
 who values life.
