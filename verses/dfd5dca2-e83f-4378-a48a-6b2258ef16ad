You are wise, you are well-read and you have gone through spiritual practices,
you have put on the garb of sanctity, you can preach and you can pose -- these
are all nothing if you do not experience the blissful union with the Beloved.
The Saguna (Attribute) you are after is an image of your own mind and it cannot
satisfy you.
