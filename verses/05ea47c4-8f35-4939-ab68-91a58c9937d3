Title: Always Needing to Wake Up
---
Wonderfully cool. Never saw such a June. Bright blue sky. Birds singing
everywhere. Not a cloud. Sunlight falls on this page through the branches
of the cedars outside the wall and is not oppressive, but pleasant, like
the sun ofMay or October.

The other day -- the novices found a bat in the conference room, and
brought him out into the garden in broad daylight in the middle of the
morning. I took him inside again and let him hang upside down in the
tool closet. The wings are a bit repellant (why?) but the bat himself
is a beautiful thing. Clinging blindly to my notebook and trembling all
over. His long ears, small eyes, “peaceful expression.” (There I go
again. Rank subjectivity.)

The battle against inertia. In the life and in myself. This is the great
thing. The constant struggle to break through illusion and falsity and
come to Christ and freedom. And how often we fail. I am convinced there
is something in our long offices and formal prayers which induces inertia
and stupor. Am I just? Or is this more subjectivism? Be honest in seeking
the answer.

The conviction that I have not even begun to write, to think, to pray,
and to live, and that only now am I getting down to waking up. And that,
by God’s grace, this comes from finally trying, with great difficulty,
to be genuinely free and alone, as humbly as I can, in God’s sight,
without passively accepting all the standards and the formulas which have
been adopted by others -- or, at least, that I am now exercising a wider
choice in my sources ofinspiration.
