Rare indeed is this human birth. The human body is like a boat, the
first and foremost use of which is to carry us across the ocean of
life and death to the shore of immortality.  The Guru is the skillful
helmsmanï¼š divine grace is the favorable wind. If with such means as
these man does not strive to cross the ocean of life and death, he is
indeed spiritually dead.
