\"Now your master has picked up some old straw dogs that had been
presented by the former kings, and has called together his disciples to
linger and lie down in sleep beneath them. Therefore the people chopped
down the tree on him in Sung, wiped away his footprints in Wei, and
made trouble for him in Shang and Chou - such were the dreams he had.
They besieged him between Ch'en and Ts'ai, and for seven days he ate no
cooked food, till he hovered on the border between life and death -
such were the nightmares he had.
