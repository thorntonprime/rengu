It depends on our mental condition whether we gain something or do not
gain something by going to the temples. We have to approach these temples
in a humble and penitent mood. They are so many homes of God. Of course
God resides in every human form, indeed every particle of His creation,
everything that is on this earth. But since we very fallible mortals do
not appreciate the fact that God is everywhere we impute special sanctity
to temples and think that God resides there.
