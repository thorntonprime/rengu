(The Theosophists) in pillaging at random whatever religious systems,
philosophical doctrines and scientific theories have crossed their
attention, have elaborated compilations wherein are to be found bits
of Vedanta, morsels of Taoism, pieces of Egyptianism, samplings of
Mazdeism. fragments of Christianity, scraps of Br√¢hmanism, shreds of
Gnosticism, dregs of Hebrew Kabbala, remnants of Paracelsus, Darwin
and Plato, crumbs of Swedenborg and Hegel. Schopenhauer and Spinoza,
-- and have propagated this on all continents in affirming that such
was Buddhist Esoterism.
