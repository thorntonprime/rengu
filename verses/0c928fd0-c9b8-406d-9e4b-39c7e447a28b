Title: Toss a Palace Your Way
---
Looks like you are doing not so bad for being under the gun as you
are.

I mean, you have not spent too much time locked up -- in any kind of
jail have you?

Aren't you able to walk about like a basically, free-range chicken?

They haven't attached any radar sensors to you yet, have they? That is
a good sign,

that seems a clear vote of confidence from society.

Hold out a little longer. Luck may shift your way even more. Someone
like Hafiz may

ask you to do a small favor. If so, carry that out as if some great
king had assigned you a royal errand,

and might then toss a palace your way for a job well done.
