\[The Persians] are accustomed to deliberate on matters of the highest moment
when warm with wine; but whatever they in this situation may determine
is again proposed to them on the morrow, in their cooler moments, by the
person in whose house they had before assembled. If at this time also it
meet their approbation, it is executed; otherwise it is rejected. Whatever
also they discuss when sober, is always a second time examined after they
have been drinking.
