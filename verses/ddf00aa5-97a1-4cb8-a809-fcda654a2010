Our Arcanum, being both a spiritual and a homogenious substance, is capable
of entering into a perfect atomic union with the imperfect metals, of taking
up into its own nature that which is like to it, and of imparting to this
Mercury its own fixity, and protecting it from the fire; so when the fire
has burnt up all the impurities, that which is left is, of course, pure gold
or silver, according to the quality of the Medicine -- which from that time
forward is (like all other gold and silver) capable of resisting the most
searching ordeal.
