And we also have spiritual exorcisms, the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ and the power of the cross. This exorcism not only drives the
dragon out of his lair and casts him into the fire, but it even heals
the wounds caused by him. If many used this exorcism and were not
healed, this was due to their lack of faith and not to the
ineffectualness of the exorcism. ...  The name of Jesus Christ is
terrible for demons, passions of the soul and diseases. Let us adorn
and protect ourselves with it.
