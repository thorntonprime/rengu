As It (the Consciousness which is your Self) never ceases to exist, Its eternal
immutability is self-evident and does not depend on any evidence Just as iron,
water, etc., which are not of the nature of light and heat, depend for them on
the sun, fire and other things other than themselves, but the sun and fire
themselves, always of the nature of light and heat, do not depend for them on
anything else; so, being of the nature of pure Knowledge It does not depend on
an evidence to prove that It exists or that It is the Knower.
