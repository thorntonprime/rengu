The less one understands and knows about these two conditions of life -- the
active and the calm -- the more careful should one be to value them both and
remember that they are only two aspects of one uniform condition. This is what
is meant when it is said that a monk who is really practising meditation does
not know that he is walking when he is walking, or sitting when he is sitting.
