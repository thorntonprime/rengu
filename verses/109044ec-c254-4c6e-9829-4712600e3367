\’Come unto me,’ says the holy Jesus, ’all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will refresh you.’ Here is more for you to live upon,
more light for your mind, more of unction for your heart than in volumes of
human instruction. Pick up the words of the holy Jesus and beg of Him to
be the light and life of your soul. Love the sound of His name; for Jesus
is the love, the sweetness, the compassionate goodness of the Deity itself
which became man, that so men might have power to become the sons of God.
