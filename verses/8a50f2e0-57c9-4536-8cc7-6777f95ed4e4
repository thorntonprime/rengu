Title: Mu Enso
By: Kojima Kendo
Commentary: |
  As one of the leading Soto Zen female monastics ofthe twentieth century,
  Kendo led a full life that combined personal practice, teaching, temple
  administration social service, and work toward equalizing the opportunities
  For monks and nuns. In her final decade she often brushed calligraphy,
  usually in square shikishi (poem-card) formats such as this example made
  near the very end of her life Here she combines two of the most familiar
  and potent Zen symbols, the universal enso (circle) and the fundamental
  koan mu. She gives her personal stamp to both forms; the enso is brushed
  with lively energy to become an oval, not quite ending where it started,
  while the regular-script mu is nestled within it, slightly to the left to
  leave some empty space for our contemplation and imagination.
