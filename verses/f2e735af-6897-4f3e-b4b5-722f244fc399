Now when Christ thus hides Himself, and withdraws the shining of His
brightness and His heat. ... man begins to complain because of his
wretchedness： Whither has gone the ardent love, the inwardness, the
gratitude, the joyful praise? And the inward consolation, the intimate
joy. the sensible savour, how has he lost them? How have the fierce
tempest of love, and all the other gifts which he felt before, become
dead in him? And he feels like an ignorant man who has lost all his
pains and his labour. And often his natural life is troubled by such a
loss.

Sometimes these unhappy men are also deprived of their earthly goods,
of friends, of kinsmen： and they are abandoned of all creatures,
their holiness is not known or esteemed, men speak evil of their works
and their whole lives, and they are despised and rejected by all their
neighbours. And at times they fall into sickness and many a plague,
and some into bodily temptations; or, that which is worst of all, into
temptations of the spirit.

From this poverty arise a fear lest one should fall, and a kind of
half-doubt. This is the utmost point at which a man can hold his
ground without falling into despair.
