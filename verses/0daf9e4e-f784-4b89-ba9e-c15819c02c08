Pythagoras, in his Fourth Table, saysï¼š How wonderful is the agreement
of Sages in the midst of difference! They all say that they have
prepared the Stone out of a substance which by the vulgar is looked
upon as the vilest thing on earth. Indeed, if we were to tell the
vulgar herd the ordinary name of our substance, they would look upon
our assertion as a daring falsehood. But if they were acquainted with
its virtue and efficacy, they would not despise that which is. in
reality, the most precious thing in the world. God has concealed this
mystery from the foolish, the ignorant, the wicked, and the scornful,
in order that they may not use it for evil purposes.
