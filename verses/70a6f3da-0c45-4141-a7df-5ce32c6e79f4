Title: Playing the Komun'go
---
I play the komun’go under the moon to forget my sadness,
but before the first tune fades, tears obscure my view.
The night becomes the sea; the harp strings a rainbow.
The sound of the komun’go rises and falls,
and your swaying follows the pitch of the strings.
The last strains chase the night and fade into the dark of the elm tree;
you look at me listlessly and close your distant eyes.
You follow the fading tune of the harp and close your distant eyes.
