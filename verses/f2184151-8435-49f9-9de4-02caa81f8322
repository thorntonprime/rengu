When man becomes familiar with dhikr, he separates himself (inwardly)
from all other things. Now, at death he is separated from all that is not
God. ... What remains is the invocation alone. If this invocation is familiar
to him, he finds his pleasure in it and rejoices that the obstacles which kept
him from it have been removed, so that he finds himself alone with his Beloved.
