You know my soul.
You know all that needs to be done there.
Do it in Your own way.
Draw me to You, O my God.
Fill me with Pure Love of You alone.
Make me never go aside from the way of Your Love.
Show me clearly that way and never let me depart itï¼š that will be enough.
I leave everything in your hands.
You will guide me without error and without danger and I will love You all
  the way.
I will belong to You.
I will not be afraid of anything for I shall remain in Your hands and
  never leave You.
