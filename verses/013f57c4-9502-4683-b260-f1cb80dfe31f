    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Transforming Dragons
---
We have no reason to distrust our world, for it is not against us. If it has
terrors, they are our terrors. If it has an abyss, it is ours. If dangers are
there, we must try to love them. And if we would live with faith in the value
of what is challenging, then what now appears to us as most alien will become
our truest, most trustworthy friend. Let us not forget the ancient myths at the
outset of humanity's journey, the myths about dragons that at the last moment
transform into princesses. Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses
who are only waiting to see us act just once with beauty and courage. Perhaps
every terror is, in its deepest essence, something that needs our recognition
or help.
