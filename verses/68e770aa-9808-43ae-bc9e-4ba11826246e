Look at words in the light of the Way - then the sovereign of the world
will be upright. Look at distinctions in the light of the Way - then
the duty of sovereign and subject will be clear. Look at abilities in
the light of the Way - then the officials of the world will be well
ordered. Look everywhere in the light of the Way - then the response of
the ten thousand things will be complete.
