Live unconcerned in this World. This Divine Lesson is taught us from Heaven
by the Holy Ghost upon this Ground： 1. Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. But this I say
Brethren, the time is short. It remaineth, that both they that have wives,
be, as though they had none; And they, that wept as though they wept not; and
they, that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they, that buy, as
though they bought not; & they that use this world, as not abusing it： For
the fashion o f this world passeth away. The Apostle here divideth all this
World into 4 Heads; 1. Relations： 2. Passions; 3. Possessions; 4.
Employments, and Entertainments. Solomon saith in one place： Why shouldst
thou set thine heart upon that, which is not. There is no real Difference
between having a Husband, Wife, or Children, and having none; between being
in Grief, or Joy, and being without Grief, or Joy; between having an Estate,
and having none; between being in the height of all Employments, or
Entertainments. and being out of all. This world hath nothing real. It is
all a Shadow. Seeing then the various States of things on Earth have no real
Difference, pass thou thorow all estates with a perfect indifference of
Spirit, in a constant calm.
