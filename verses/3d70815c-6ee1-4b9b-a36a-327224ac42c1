If one sees only superficial forms of matter and does not penetrate the
true nature of visual reality, one is spiritually blind.

If one hears only temporary function of noise and does not penetrate to the
true nature of auditory reality, one is spiritually deaf.

Forms and sounds are only illusions. We use vision and hearing to determine
their essence to understand the true nature of reality.
