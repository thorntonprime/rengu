  - Sacrifice-Death=Death=The Destruction of I-Consciousness
By: Swami Sivananda
---
The mind exists in relation to the ‘I’, and vice-versa. ‘I’ is only an
idea of the mind; it and the ‘I’ are identical. If the ‘I’ vanishes,
the mind will do the same, and vice-versa. Destroy the mind by means
of true knowledge (tattva-jnâna); destroy the ‘I’ by the consciousness
that ‘I am Brahman’ (‘aham Brahmâsmi bhâvana’), and this through
constant and intense meditation. When the mind vanishes and thought
ceases, name and form (nama-rûpa) disappear and the end is attained.
