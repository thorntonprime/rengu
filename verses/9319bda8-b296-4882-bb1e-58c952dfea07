\"The horse lover will use a fine box to catch the dung and a giant clam
shell to catch the stale. But if a mosquito or a fly lights on the
horse and he slaps it at the wrong time, then the horse will break the
bit, hurt its head, and bang its chest. The horse lover tries to think
of everything, but his affection leads him into error. Can you afford
to be careless?"
