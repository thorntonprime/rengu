A monk asked Touzi, "Every sound is Buddha's sound.
Correct or not?"

Touzi said, "Correct."

The monk said, "[Then] Venerable, aren't [your] farts
the chirping sound of the Buddha's bowl?"

Touzi then hit.

He again asked, "Coarse words and fine speech all return
to the primary meaning. Correct or not?"

Touzi said, "Correct."

The monk said, "May I call the Venerable to be taken for
one donkey?"

Touzi then hit.

[Xuedou added] "Fart."
