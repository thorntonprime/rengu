The utmost a spirit can attain to in this body is to dwell in a condition
beyond the necessity of virtues; where goodness as a whole comes natural to
it so that not only is it possessed of virtues but virtue is part and parcel
of it; it is virtuous not of necessity but of innate good nature. Arrived
at this the soul has traversed and transcended all necessity for virtues;
they are now intrinsic in her.
