Confucius said, "At last I may say that I have seen a dragon - a dragon
that coils to show his body at its best, that sprawls out to display
his patterns at their best, riding on the breath of the clouds, feeding
on the yin and yang. My mouth fell open and I couldn't close it; my
tongue flew up and I couldn't even stammer. How could I possibly make
any estimation of Lao Tan!"
