Title: Ferryboat and Traveler
---
I’m the ferryboat;
you’re the traveler.

You walk on me with muddy feet;
I hold you and cross the water.
Ibear you across the deep, the shallow, the rapid.

If you don’t come, I endure wind, snow, rain,
and wait for you, from dusk to dawn.
Once you cross the water, you leave without looking back.
Sooner or later you’ll come, I know.
I wait for you and grow old day by day.

I’m the ferryboat;
you’re the traveler.
