It is useless, to simply substitute the “experience” of oneself as a
hermit tor the “experience” of oneselfas active, as a “monk,” as a
“writer,” etc. The same error is repeated in a new way. In reality the
hermit life does imply a certain attrition of one's identity. In context
a word that implies “loss of identity. This must also be resisted： one
does not live alone in order to become a vegetable. Yet the resistance does
not take the form of asserting a social and evident identity of one who
is going somewhere or doing something special. A curious kind of identity,
then： “in God."

Merely living alone but continuing to engage in a lot of projects is not
yet an authentic hermit lite. The projects must go. Solitude demands an
emptiness, an aimlessness, a going nowhere, a certain "having nothing to do,"
especially nothing that involves the growth and assertion of one‘s "image"
and one's “career."

Distraction： the illusory expectation of some fulfillment, which in the
end is only a human loneliness.

  Were you not forever distraced by expectation, as if everything were
    announcing to you some (coming) beloved?
  (Rainer Maria Rilke, 1st Duino Elegy)
