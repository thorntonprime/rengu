Discrimination is the reasoning by which one knows that God alone is real and
all else is unreal. Real means eternal, and unreal means impermanent. He who
has acquired discrimination knows that God is the only Substance and all else
is non-existent. With the awakening of this spirit of discrimination a man
wants to know God, ... who is of the very nature of Reality.
