Title: Easier to Cuddle With
---
Sometimes I feel as if I am involved with the extraordinary;
that something of my efforts -- and their results -- are a great triumph,
 for both of us;
that something I have labored with added to a bridge, we can cross to see
 the Beloved more as He isï¼š Damn easier to cuddle with. And always inviting.
What a great athlete might feel in a moment of joy and wonder, in accomplishing
 the nearly impossible, I have known that -- and much more.
You are extraordinary to my eye, everything about anyone.
Others too can see you as I do, but rarely do they have an interest in the pen.
I am telling you the truth. It is difficult to bear your splendor.
How I just don't explode and vanish -- pop from ecstasy, I don't know?
This is just another astonishing event, another one of those divine
 mysteries ... we can hear about, and is worthy of the evening news.
