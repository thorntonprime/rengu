Title: Let Me Think a Second
Description: August 21

Some great high-wire act the path to God becomes.
And look at that long pole that is also needed to balance you, so you
 don’t fall.
And look at that long pole that is also needed to gain balance, so you
 don’t fall.
Let me think a second. How about in part：
doing something that you know will be good for you,
that you have not yet done. And of course, humility, and of course kindness.
