What if man had eyes to see the true Beauty -- the divine Beauty. I mean, pure
and clear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all
the colours and vanities of human life -- thither looking, and holding
converse with the true Beauty simple and divine? Remember how in that
communion only, beholding Beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled
to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an
image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to
become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may. Would that be an
ignoble life?
