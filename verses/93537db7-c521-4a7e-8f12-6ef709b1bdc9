In order to say a little about this dark night, I shall trust neither
to experience nor to knowledge, since both may fail and deceive; but,
while not omitting to make such use as I can of these two things, I
shall avail myself, in all that, with the Divine favour, I have to
say, or at the least, in that which is most important and dark to the
understanding, of Divine Scripture; for, if we guide ourselves by
this, we shall be unable to stray, since He Who speaks therein is the
Holy Spirit. And if in aught I stray, whether through my imperfect
understanding of that which is said in it or of matters unconnected
with it, it is not my intention to depart from the sound sense and
doctrine of our Holy Mother the Catholic Church; for in such a case I
submit and resign myself wholly, not only to her command, but to
whatever better judgement she may pronounce concerning it.
