Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not
as good as using a non-attribute to show that attributes are not
attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not
as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse,
Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one
horse.
