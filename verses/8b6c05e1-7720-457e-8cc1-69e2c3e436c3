The whole Pythagoric school produced by certain appropriate songs, what they
called exartysis or adaptation, synarmoge or elegance of manners, and epaphe or
contact, usefully conducting the dispositions of the soul to passions contrary
to those which it before possessed. For when they went to bed they purified the
reasoning power from the perturbations and noises to which it had been exposed
during the day, by certain odes and peculiar songs, and by this means procured
for themselves tranquil sleep, and few and good dreams. But when they rose from
bed, they again liberated themselves from the torpor and heaviness of sleep, by
songs of another kind. Sometimes, also, by musical sounds alone, unaccompanied
with words, they healed the passions of the soul and certain diseases,
enchanting, as they say, in reality. And it is probable that from hence this
name epode, i.e, enchantment, came to be generally used. After this manner,
therefore, Pythagoras through music produced the most beneficial correction of
human manners and lives.
