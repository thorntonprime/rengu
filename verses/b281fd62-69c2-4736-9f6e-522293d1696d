These rites of the Inipi (Purification Lodge) are very wakan (sacred)
and are used before any great undertaking for which we wish to make
ourselves pure or for which we wish to gain strength; and in many
winters past our men, and often the women, made the Inipi even every
day, and sometimes several times in a day, and from this we received
much of our power. Now that we have neglected these rites we have lost
much of this power; it is not good, and I cry when I think of it. I
pray often that the Great Spirit will show to our young people the
importance of these rites.
