Nothing over which the firmament of heaven revolves maintains an unchanged
existence, but every hour assumes some new form. Every moment a fresh picture
is presented to the view; and one appearance is scarce complete ere another
supervenes, obliterating all traces of the first, as wave follows wave upon
the shore. No wise man would seek to build his house upon the waves, or hope
to find a foundation for it there. ...

The wisest of mankind are those who have renounced all worldly desires, and
chosen the calm and peaceful lot of a recluseâ€™s life. Behind every pleasure
lurk twenty pains; far better is it then to forego one fleeting joy and spare
oneself a lifetime of regret.
