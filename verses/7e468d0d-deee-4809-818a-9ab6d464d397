It is so general a report, and so many aver it either from their own
experience or from others, that are of indubitable honesty and credit,
that the silvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often injured
women, desiring and acting carnally with them, and that certain devils
whom the Gauls call dusii do continually practise this uncleanness,
and tempt others to it, which is affirmed by such persons, and with
such confidence, that it were impudence to deny it.
