All dalliance with what wears the mask of the authentic, all
attraction towards mere semblance, tells of a mind misled by the spell
of forces pulling towards unreality. The sorcery of nature is at work
in thisï¼š to pursue the non-good, drawn in unreasoning impulse by its
specious appearance, is to be led unknowing down paths unchosen; and
what can that be but magic?

Alone in immunity from magic is he who, though drawn by the alien
parts of his being.  withholds his assent to their standards of worth,
recognizing the good only where his authentic self sees and knows it,
tranquilly possessing it, and so never charmed away
