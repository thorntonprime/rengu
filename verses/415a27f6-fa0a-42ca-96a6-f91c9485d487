Heaven-and-earth is not sentimental;
It treats all things as straw-dogs.
The Sage is not sentimental;
He treats all his people as straw-dogs.

Between Heaven and Earth,
There seems to be a Bellows：
It is empty, and yet it is inexhaustible;
The more it works, the more comes out of it.
No amount of words can fathom it：
Better look for it within you.
