He said unto me. Son of man. can these bones live? And I answered. O
Lord God. thou knowest.

Again he said unto me. Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them. O
ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.

Thus saith the Lord God unto these bonesï¼š Behold. I will cause breath
to enter into you.  and ye shall live.
