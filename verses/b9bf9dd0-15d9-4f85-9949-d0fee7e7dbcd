Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
If you go off to the green woods nearby, you can take along food for
three meals and come back with your stomach as full as ever. If you are
going a hundred li, you must grind your grain the night before; and if
you are going a thousand li, you must start getting the provisions
together three months in advance. What do these two creatures
understand? Little understanding cannot come up to great understanding;
the shortlived cannot come up to the long-lived.
