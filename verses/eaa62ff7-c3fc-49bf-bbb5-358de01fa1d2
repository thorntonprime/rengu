The clearer the body, the brighter one’s Buddha Nature shines. In the
beginning, we still need the body. It’s like a lamp. The Buddha Nature is
this flame. But we may still be conscious of shadows. As we progress we
feel that the body is the universe itself and that our Buddha Self shines
throughout it like the sun.
