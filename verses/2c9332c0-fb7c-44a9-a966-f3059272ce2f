Everything is linked with everything else down to the lowest ring on the chain,
and the true essence of God is above as well as below, in the heavens and on
the earth, and nothing exists outside Him. And this is what the sages mean when
they say： When God gave the Torah to Israel, He opened the seven heavens to
them, and they saw that nothing was there in reality but His Glory; He opened
the seven worlds to them and they saw that nothing was there but His Glory; He
opened the seven abysses before their eyes, and they saw that nothing was there
but His Glory. Meditate on these things and you will understand that God’s
essence is linked and connected with all worlds, and that all forms of
existence are linked and connected with each other, but derived from His
existence and essence.
