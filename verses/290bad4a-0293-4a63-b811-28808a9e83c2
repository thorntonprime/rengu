Any want of measure and symmetry in any mixture whatever must always of
necessity be fatal, both to the elements and to the mixture, which is then not
a mixture, but only a confused medley which brings confusion on the possessor
of it. ... Then, if we are not able to hunt the good with one idea only, with
three we may catch our preyï¼š Beauty, Symmetry, Truth are the three, and these
taken together we may regard as the single cause of the mixture, and the
mixture as being good by reason of the infusion of them.
