On returning from this visit to Lao Tze, Confucius did not speak for three
days. A disciple asked him, saying, ‘Master, when you saw Lao Tze, in what
direction did you admonish him?’

‘I saw a dragon,’ replied Confucius, ‘-- a dragon which by convergence
showed a body, by radiation became colour, and riding upon the clouds
of heaven, nourished the two principles of creation. My mouth was agape;
I could not shut it. How then do you think I was going to admonish Lao Tze?’
