Chuang Tzu held on to the fishing pole and, without turning his head,
said, "I have heard that there is a sacred tortoise in Ch'u that has
been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in cloth
and boxed, and stores it in the ancestral temple. Now would this
tortoise rather be dead and have its bones left behind and honored? Or
would it rather be alive and dragging its tail in the mud?"
