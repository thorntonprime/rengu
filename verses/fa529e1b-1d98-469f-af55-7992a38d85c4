Notes:
  '1': In China the dragon has always been regarded as a highly admirable
    creature of celestial origin, and symbolizes the energy of nature,
    as in lightning or a storm. WHen the dragon flies it is time for
    man to act; when it is in hiding it is time to conserver our energies
    for a more propitious moment.
  '2': "He is undecided what course to take. Two possibilities are\
    \ present\uFF1A he can become an important man in the world, or\
    \ become a great sage who seeks seclusion from the world. Either\
    \ course, no blame."

\  Creative, celestial forces
  Bestow suiccess in showers!
  The wise man chooses courses
  That lend him inner powers!

The power and motion of celestial forcesï¼š The Image of the Creative
Principle -- grasping which the wise man develops his own power and
endurance.

  As the lightning in the cloud,
  The dragon[1] is in hiding!
  The wise man is endowed
  With patience and abiding.

  The dragon[1] is now in the open space.
  Visit a great man -- recieve his grace!

  The wise man works by day
  And stays alert at night.
  Though danger comes his way,
  No blame; his conduct has been right.

  He leaps about the grat abyss,[2]
  And his step is sure; he will not miss!

  The dragon[1] takes wing and flies in the sky.
  Visit a great man; the time is nigh!

  A haughty dragon[1] will soon come to regret!
  A man too high placed, with fear is beset.
