Title: The Creative Principle
---
\  Creative, celestial forces
  Bestow suiccess in showers!
  The wise man chooses courses
  That lend him inner powers!

The power and motion of celestial forces： The Image of the Creative
Principle -- grasping which the wise man develops his own power and
endurance.

  As the lightning in the cloud,
  The dragon is in hiding!
  The wise man is endowed
  With patience and abiding.

  The dragon is now in the open space.
  Visit a great man -- recieve his grace!

  The wise man works by day
  And stays alert at night.
  Though danger comes his way,
  No blame; his conduct has been right.

  He leaps about the grat abyss,
  And his step is sure; he will not miss!

  The dragon takes wing and flies in the sky.
  Visit a great man; the time is nigh!

  A haughty dragon will soon come to regret!
  A man too high placed, with fear is beset.
