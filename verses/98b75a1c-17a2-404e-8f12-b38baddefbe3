It sounds strange to say the soul must lose her God, yet I affirm that
in a way it is more necessary to perfection that the soul lose God
than that she lose creatures. Everything must go. The soul must
subsist in absolute nothingness. It is the full intention of God that
the soul shall lose her God, for as long as the soul possesses God, is
aware of God, knows God, she is aloof from God. God desires to
annihilate himself in the soul in order that the soul may lose
herself. For that God is God he gets from creatures.  When the soul
became a creature she obtained a God. When she lets slip her
creaturehood, God remains to himself that he is. and the soul honours
God most in being quit of God and leaving him to himself.
