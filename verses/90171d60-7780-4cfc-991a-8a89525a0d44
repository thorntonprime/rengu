Hsu Yu said, "Watch out! You'll put the world in danger! Nieh Ch'ueh is
a man of keen intelligence and superb understanding, nimble-wined and
sharp. His inborn nature surpasses that of other men, and he knows how
to exploit what Heaven has given him through human devices. He would do
his best to prevent error, but he doesn't understand the source from
which error arises. Make him the counterpart of Heaven? Watch - he will
start leaning on men and forget about Heaven. He will put himself first
and relegate others to a class apart. He will worship knowledge and
chase after it with the speed of fire. He will become the servant of
causes, the victim of things, looking in all four directions to see how
things are faring, trying to attend to all wants, changing along with
things and possessing no trace of any constancy of his own. How could
he possibly do as counterpart of Heaven? However, there are clans and
there are clan heads. He might do as the father of one branch, though
he would never do as the father of the father of the branch. His kind
are the forerunners of disorder, a disaster to the ministers facing
north, a peril to the sovereign facing south!"
