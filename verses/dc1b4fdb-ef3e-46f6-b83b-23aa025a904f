How do I know this is so? The morning mushroom knows nothing of
twilight and dawn; the summer cicada knows nothing of spring and
autumn. They are the short-lived. South of Ch'u there is a caterpillar
which counts five hundred years as one spring and five hundred years as
one autumn. Long, long ago there was a great rose of Sharon that
counted eight thousand years as one spring and eight thousand years as
one autumn. They are the long-lived. Yet P'eng-tsu alone is famous
today for having lived a long time, and everybody tries to ape him.
Isn't it pitiful!
