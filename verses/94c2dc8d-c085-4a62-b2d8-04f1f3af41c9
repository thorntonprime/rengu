Title: I Have Winced at the Prospect
Description: July 17
---
I have winced at the prospect of reading a long poem. Even my own.
That happened the other day when I found one hiding behind the couch, and
 I braved exploring its terrain.
If that could happen to me, I thought, oh my goodness, what about you coming
 across drunken ramblings?
For any unpleasant twitches and pain I have caused you, apologies extended.
