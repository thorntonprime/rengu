With little wisdom, still I set upon the Way,
my only fear to go astray.
The path is low and fit to follow,
yet how men love to wander!

While fields are filled with weeds,
while granaries are bare,
some revel in fine clothes,
fine wine, fine food,
and altogether more than they can use.
Such is robbery, not the Way.
