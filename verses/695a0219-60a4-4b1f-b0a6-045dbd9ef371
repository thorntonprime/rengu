In that degenerate age when all the Three Sacred Treasures have perished
. . . nothing will remain but the 'tabula rasa' Nembutsu with its six mystical
symbols, from which has already faded away all the coloring with which it
had been stained hy the meditative and non-meditative disciplines. At that
time, as it says in the Larger Sûtra, if a man but hears the Nembutsu and
then repeats it, he will be sure to attain Ojd. In fact even though he be
a non-believer in Buddhism itself, he will certainly attain Ôjô by merely
repeating the Nembutsu ten times or even once, because of the mighty power
in those six mystical symbols.
