He was. Taaroa was his name, he stood in the void; no earth, no sky, no
men. Taaroa calls to the four comers of the universe. Nothing replies. Alone
existing, he changes himself into universe. Taaroa is the light, he is the
seed, he is the base, he is the incorruptible. The universe is only the
shell of Taaroa. It is he who puts it in motion and brings forth its harmony.
