Thy will is entered into self-hood： and all that does vex, plague, and annoy
thee, is only thy self hood： thou makest thyself thy own enemy, and bringest
thyself into selfdestruction or death.

Now if thou wilt get again out of death, then thou must wholly forsake thy
own self-desire, which has introduced itself into strange essence, and become
in self hood, and the self-desire, as a nothing, so that thou dost no longer
will or desire to thyself, but wholly and fully introduce thy desire again
with the resignation into the eternal, viz. into God's will, that the same
will may be thy will and desire.

Without this there is nothing but misery and death, a continual dying and
perishing
