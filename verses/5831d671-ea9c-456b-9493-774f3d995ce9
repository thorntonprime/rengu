When God's nearness takes possession of a man's heart, it overwhelms all else,
both the inward infiltrations of the purposes and the outward motions of the
members. Thereafter that man continues, going or coming, taking or giving：
there prevails in him the purpose which has ruled his mind, namely, the love of
God and His nearness.
