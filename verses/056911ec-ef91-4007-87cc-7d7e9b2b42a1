When the stupidest folks read my poems,
they snort in incomprehension ...
When the middling sort read my poems,
they think them over and pronounce them deep ...
When a sage reads a poem of mine,
his face breaks into a great big smile.
When the great Yang Hsiu saw the
young woman, in an instant,
he understood the mystery!
