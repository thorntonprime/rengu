As a man standing on the seashore not only sees the sea but can also walk
into it as often as he likes; so is it with men who have reached spiritual
perfection; they can also enter the Divine Light when they wish, contemplating
it and participating in it consciously in proportion to their works, their
efforts and the aspirations of their desire.
