Talking about my generationï¼š
  So many busy men,
broad in their educations, broad their views,
but they don't know a thing about their very own
 natures,
and they wander way off the Way.
If they really saw what's real,
why would they offer us stale empty dreams?
In the single mantra, now, the heart,
you learn to know your own,
se6ing what the Buddha sees.
