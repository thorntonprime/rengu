Title: Sheba's Throne I
---
When the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon,
she left behind her kingdom and her wealth,
the same way lovers leave their reputations.

Her servants meant nothing to her,
less than a rotten onion.
Her palaces and orchards, so many piles of dung.

She heard the inner meaning of LAï¼š No.
She came to Solomon with nothing, except her throne.

As the writer's pen becomes a friend,
as the tool the workman uses day after day
becomes deeply familiar, so her filigreed throne
was her one attachment.

It was a large throne and difficult to transport,
because it could not be taken apart,
being as cunningly put together as the human body.
