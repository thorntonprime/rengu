There is a fine saying of one heathen philosopher to another about
this, he says： ‘I am aware of something in me which sparkles in my
intelligence： I clearly perceive that it is somewhat but what I
cannot grasp. Yet methinks if I could only seize it I should know all
truth." To which the other philosopher replied： ‘Follow it boldly!
for if thou canst seize it thou wilt possess the sum-total of all good
and have eternal life!’ St Augustine expresses himself in the same
sense： ‘I am conscious of something within me that plays before my
soul and is as a light dancing in front of it： were this brought to
steadiness and perfection in me it would surely be eternal life!’ It
hides yet it shows. It comes, but after the manner of a thief, with
intent to take and to steal all things from the soul. By emerging and
showing itself somewhat it purposes to decoy the soul and draw it
towards itself to rob it and take itself from it. As saith the
prophet： ‘Lord take from them their spirit and give them instead thy
spirit.’
