Attentiveness is the heartâ€™s stillness, unbroken by any thought. In this
stillness the heart breathes and invokes, endlessly and without ceasing,
only Jesus Christ who is the Son of God and Himself God.

 ...

One type of watchfulness consists in closely scrutinizing every mental image
or provocation. ... A second type of watchfulness consists in freeing the
heart from all thoughts, keeping it profoundly silent and still, and in
praying. A third type consists in continually and humbly calling upon the
Lord Jesus Christ for help.
