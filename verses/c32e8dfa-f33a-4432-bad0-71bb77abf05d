---
The Way of heaven is like stringing a bow.
It depresses the high,
And raises the low.
It takes from excess,
And gives to the lacking.
It’s heaven’s Way
To take from excess
And give to the lacking.
People do otherwise.
They take from those who lack
And give to those with excess.
Who can take his excess
And give it to the realm?
One who knows the Way.
So the wise do good but ask no thanks.
They do their work but claim no merit.
They do not wish to display their virtue.
