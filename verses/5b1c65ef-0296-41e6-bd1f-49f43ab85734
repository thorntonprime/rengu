The happiness obtained on the cessation of desire is ever the same. Whatever
may have been the varieties of desire that preceded it, the bliss had on
the cessation of desire is the same. If a man is affected by some disease,
you may ask him： ‘What is the disease you are suffering from?’ When
he has recovered from the disease and regained his normal health, nobody
can ask him： ‘What is the health you are now having?’ The reason is,
though diseases may be many and various, health is ever one and the same.
