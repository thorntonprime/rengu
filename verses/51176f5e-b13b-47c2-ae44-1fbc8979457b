    Description: From Rilke's collected French Poems
Title: One Sufficient Word
Description: July 2
Format: Verse

A rose by itself is every rose.
And this one is irreplaceable,
perfect, one sufficient word
in the context of all things.

Without what we see in her,
how can we speak our hopes
or endure a tender moment
in the winds of departure.
