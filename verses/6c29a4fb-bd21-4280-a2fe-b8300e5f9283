Title: Move on to Your Glory
---
What can you see of existence's attempt to honor you, when you keep turning
  back to a time where some event you seemed to take part in may cause you to
  lower your head, and whisper again ... I am sorry?

We are waiting for you to arrive at your own coronation, but you really can't
  accept the crown with any regrets in your past. Where does that then leave
  you ... in line for the throne?

What can you see of every object's attempt to pay homage to you, because of
  your divine lineage, if you are stuck in any kind of confessional?

All happenings needed to be; accept that, my dear. Ask for any forgiveness one
  more time if you must,

ask for forgiveness one more time if you must, then move on to your glory and
  sublime reign.
