Death then is the dissolution of the body, and the cessation of bodily
sense; and about this we have no cause to be troubled. But there is
something else, which demands our anxious thought, though men in
general disregard it through ignorance or unbelief. ... When the soul
has quitted the body, there will be held a trial and investigation of
its deserts The everlasting existence of the soul is to its detriment
in this respect, that its imperishable faculty of feeling makes it
subject to everlasting punishment. Know then that we have good cause
for fear and dread, and need to be on our guard, lest we should be
involved in such a doom as this. Those who disbelieve will, after they
have sinned, be forced to believe： they will be convinced, not by
words, but by hard facts, not by mere threats, but by suffering the
punishment in very deed. All things are known to God, and the
punishments inflicted will vary in accordance with the character of
men’s offences.
