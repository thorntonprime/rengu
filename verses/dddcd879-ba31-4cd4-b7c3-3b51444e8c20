A person who is alone can’t hold a conversation. A drum has to be hollow
for its sound to reverberate. Absences count. Words limit. Interpretations
differ. What isn’t said is also relevant. Absolute Truth cannot be
expressed in words. It must be experienced.

And then, in eloquent silence we best reveal that we have awakened to the
Dharma.
