Title: What Then of You?
---
We think of things as this or that,
as better or worse, as good or bad,

but in God everything is what it
is and lives in the perfection of

its being, which is to say that the
little fly as it exists in God is

nobler than the highest angel
is in itself. What then of me?

What then of you?
