You are a principal work, a fragment of God Himself, you have in yourself a
part of Him. Why then are you ignorant of your high birth? ... You bear God
about with you, poor wretch, and know it not. Do you think I speak of some
external god of silver or gold?  No, you bear Him about within you and are
unaware that you are defiling Him with unclean thoughts and foul actions.
If an image of God were present, you would not dare to do any of the things
you do; yet when God Himself is present within you and sees and hears all
things, you are not ashamed of thinking and acting thus： O slow to
understand your nature, and estranged from God!
