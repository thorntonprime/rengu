You know, I always carry a tiny statue of our Lady in my pocket. At times,
I give it away to some person for a very special reason. Then I get another
one. The day I gave this one to Fulton Sheen, someone gave me another one,
a very pretty one, in the afternoon.

Our Lady is my companion on my tours. I call her my companion since the
following fact happened. I had asked the father at Berhampur, after bringing
my sisters there, to give me a big statue of the Miraculous Virgin with
arms extended downward and palms open, sending graces to the world. He did
so, packed it well in a large case, and I took it to the station. I had
a railway pass for ‘Mother Teresa and a companion.’ They wanted me to
pay for the freight of the case and the statue; but I refused. ‘I have
a pass for myself and a companion,” I said. ‘Here is my companion. It
is the statue of Mother Mary, and she travels with me as a companion.’
They let me take her without paying extra for the freight of the box. Since
then, I say that our Lady is my traveling companion. I am never alone.
