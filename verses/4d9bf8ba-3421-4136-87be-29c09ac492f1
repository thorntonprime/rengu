Description: The Mercury of the Philosophers speaking.
---
Raising myself from death, I kill death -- which kills me. I raise up
again the bodies that I have created. Living in death, I destroy
myself -- whereof you rejoice. You cannot rejoice without me and my
life.

If I carry the poison in my head, in my tail which I bite with rage
lies the remedy. Whoever thinks to amuse himself at my expense, I
shall kill with my gimlet eye.

Whoever bites me must bite himself first; otherwise, if I bite him,
death shall bite him first, in the head; for first he must bite me --
biting being the medicine of biting.
