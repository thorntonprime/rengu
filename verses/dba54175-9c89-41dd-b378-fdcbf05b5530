When, after two sleepless nights, I had passed day and night in meditating on
the permutations (Gematrioth) or on the principles essential to a recognition
of this true reality (of the holy Names contained in the Great Name of God)
and to the annihilation of all extraneous thought -- then I had two signs by
which I knew that I was in the right receptive mood. The one sign was the
intensification of natural thought on very profound objects of knowledge,
a debility of the body and strengthening of the soul until I sat there, my
self all soul. The second sign was that imagination grew strong within me and
it seemed as though my forehead were going to burst. Then I knew that I was
ready to receive the Name. I also that Sabbath night ventured at the great
ineffable Name of God (the name JHWH). But immediately that I touched it,
it weakened me and a voice issued from me saying： ‘Thou shalt surely
die and not live! Who brought thee to touch the Great Name?’ And behold,
immediately I fell prone and implored the Lord God saying： ‘Lord of
the universe! I entered into this place only for the sake of Heaven, as Thy
glory knoweth. What is my sin and what my transgression? I entered only to
know Thee, for has not David already commanded Solomon： Know the God of
thy father and serve Him; and has not our master Moses, peace be upon him,
revealed this to us in the Torah saying： Show me now Thy way, that I
may know Thee, that I may there find grace in Thy sight?’ And behold,
I was still speaking and oil like the oil of the anointment anointed me
from head to foot and very great joy seized me which for its spirituality
and the sweetness of its rapture I cannot describe.
