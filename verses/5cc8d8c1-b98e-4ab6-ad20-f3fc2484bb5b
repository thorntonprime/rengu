Indeed, every true word ever uttered, every thought sincerely and lucidly
entertained, every harmonious note sung or sounded, laughter Hashing like
lightning between the head and the heart, human love in all its diversity
binding together husbands and wives, parents and children, grandparents and
grandchildren, and making of all mankind one family and our earth their home;
the earth itself with its colours and shapes and smells, and its setting in
a universe growing ever vaster and its basic components becoming ever more
microscopic -- seen with the eyes of Faith, it all adds up to a oneness,
an image of everlasting reality.
