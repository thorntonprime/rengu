At the Gathering for Judgement the Faithful will say, ‘O Angel, is not
Hell the common road

Trodden by the believer and infidel alike? Yet we saw not any smoke or
fire on our way.’

Then the Angel will reply： ‘That garden which ye saw as ye passed

Was indeed Hell, but unto you it appeared a pleasaunce of greenery.

Since ye strove against the flesh and quenched the flames of lust for
God’s sake,

So that they became verdant with holiness and lit the path to
salvation;

Since ye turned the fire of wrath to meekness, and murky ignorance to
radiant knowledge;

Since ye made the fiery soul (nafs) an orchard where nightingales of
prayer and praise were ever singing --

So hath Hell-fire become for you greenery and roses and riches without
end.’
