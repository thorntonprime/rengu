The ancient adepts of the Way
did not teach the people everything,
freeing them from confusion.

People are hard to govern
when they have too much learning.

Who governs academically
deprives the people.
Who governs sympathically
enriches the people.
Between these two is set a measure,
To respect it always,
such is the wonder of integrity.
How deep, how far-reaching!
It receives all things
and leads them to great oneness.
