Many people think that one cannot arrive at spiritual perfection in
leading a family life.  How much truth is there to this? What
wonderful opportunities for spiritual development are to be met with
in all families! The love and affection between parents and children,
husband and wife, brothers and sisters, parents and friends, the
benediction which the poor and unfortunate bring to us, all help
infinitely in establishing a spiritual life. The more your soul
undergoes the trials caused by pleasures and hardships, the more it is
purified and the more refined becomes your spirit of sacrifice for
others. There surges up in a heart belaboured by all the changing
currents of family life a profound aspiration for divine aid much more
so than is generally found in the life of a hermit centered upon
himself.
