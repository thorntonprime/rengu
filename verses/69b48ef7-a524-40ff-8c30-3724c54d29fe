Shall we have not the vision to see that in suppressing a sixth (or
whatever the number) of ourselves, we have depressed ourselves? No man
takes another down a pit without descending into it himself and sinning
in the bargain. It is not the suppressed that sin. It is the suppressor
who has to answer for his crime against those whom he suppresses.
