When you withdraw from the world for prayer,
don't worry about anything else on your schedule that day.
For the moment, don't think ahead.
Don't clutter the time.
Don't plan your future.
Reject all thoughts, good or bad.
And unless you really feel the need, don't pray out loud.
However, if you must say something,
don't analyze how few or how many words you use
or what they mean or even what kind they are,
such as set liturgical prayer, psalm, hymn, antiphon, or any other kind.
Don't pay attention to the wordles, interior nature of your prayer
or to its being vocalized and heard
and also don't scrutinize the specific or general nature of your intercession.

Empty your mind of everything except a naked intent reaching out to God.
Don't clothe this with thoughts of who God is or what he has created.
Just be aware that he is as he is.
Let him be himself, please.
Don't force God into any other shape.
Don't let your mazelike mind probe him.
Trust that God is God, and let that faith be your foundation.

By grounding this naked intent in faith,
you reduce your consciousness and emotions to nothing but a simple recognition
and a blind embracing of your own being.
It's as if you're saying to Godï¼š
"I offer myself to you, Lord,
without analyzing anything about you.
I'm accepting you as you are, nothing added."
