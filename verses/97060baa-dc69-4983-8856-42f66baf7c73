Description: Speaking to Vasubandhu

I don’t seek enlightenment, nor am I deluded. I don't worship Buddha, nor am I
disrespectful. I don’t sit for long periods, nor am I lazy. I don’t eat only
once a day, nor am I a glutton. I am not contented, nor am I greedy. When the
mind does not seek anything, this is called the Way.
