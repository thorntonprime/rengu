There is much beauty here, for great beauty is everywhere. Living waters
flow endlessly through ancient aqueducts into the great city, and dance
in many piazzas over white stone basins and spread out in spacious pools,
murmuring by day and lifting their murmur into the starry, wind-softened
night. There are gardens here, unforgettable boulevards, and stairs-stairs
designed by Michelangelo, stairs inspired by downward flowing water-step
flowing into widening step like wave into wave. From such impressions you
gather yourself, you win yourself back from the clamoring multiplicity, and
slowly learn to know a very few things in which the eternal is reflected,
which you love and in which your solitude allows you to take part.
