Integrity means to follow the Way, fully the Way,
ever so elusive and ineffable.

Elusive and ineffable!
—and yet it holds true form.
Ineffable and elusive!
—and yet it holds true substance.
How close, how dark, how deep within!
—and yet it holds an essence,
a touchstone of one's faith.

Since antiquity, its name has been preserved,
an echoing of how all things began.
How can one know of things remote?
—By what is deep within.
