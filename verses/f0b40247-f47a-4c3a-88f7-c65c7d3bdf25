Loneliness, with its fear and ache, is isolation, the inevitable action
ofthe self. This process ofisolation, whether expansive or narrow, is
productive of confusion, conflict and sorrow. Isolation can never give
birth to aloneness; the one has to cease for the other to be. Aloneness is
indivisihle and loneliness is separation. That which is alone is pliable
and so enduring. Only the alone can commune with that which is causeless,
the immeasurable. To the alone, life is eternal; to the alone there is no
death. The alone can never cease to be.
