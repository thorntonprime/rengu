At the bidding of a Peter the Hermit millions of men hurled themselves
against the East; the words of an hallucinated enthusiast such as Mohamet
created a force capable of triumphing over the Graeco-Roman world; an
obscure monk like Luther bathed Europe in blood, The voice of a Galileo or
a Newton will never have the least echo among the masses, The inventors of
genius hasten the march of civilization, The fanatics and the hallucinated
create history.
