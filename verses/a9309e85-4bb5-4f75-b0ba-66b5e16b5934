Title: When You Left
---
When you left, I was sick in another village
 and there was no parting kiss.
It was the time of the first autumn wind,
 a leaf or two reddening on the maple branch.

I’m going to cut away your parting from eternal time.
 Then time will be in two pieces.
You hold one end, I the other, and time will link
 when we join hands.

Then those poised to write the misfortunes of others
 won’t be able to record your parting.
I’m going to cut away your parting from eternal time.
