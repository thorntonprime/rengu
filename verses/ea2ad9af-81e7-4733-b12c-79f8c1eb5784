Our innate nature is happiness itself and we ever have it with us. But we do
not realize it. On the other hand, we begin to seek for it elsewhere in the
objective world outside us, just as a person who is ignorant of a treasure
buried in his own house goes about begging. The world fascinates us only
because of this ignorance. There is no doubt about it.
