Title: Cast All Your Votes for Dancing
---
I know the voice of depression still calls to you.
I know those habits that can ruin your life still send their invitations.
But you are with the Friend now and look so much stronger.
You can stay that way and even bloom! Keep squeezing drops of the Sun
from your prayers and work and music and from your companions’ beautiful
 laughter.
Keep squeezing drops of the Sun from the sacred hands and glance of your
 Beloved
and, my dear, from the most insignificant movements of your own holy body.
Learn to recognize the counterfeit coins that may buy you just a moment
 of pleasure
but then drag you for days like a broken man behind a farting camel.

You are with the Friend now. Learn what actions of yours delight Him,
what actions of yours bring freedom and love.
Whenever you say God’s name, dear pilgrim, my ears wish my head was missing
so they could finally kiss each other and applaud all your nourishing wisdom!
O keep squeezing drops of the Sun from your prayers and work and music
and from your companions’ beautiful laughter, and from the most insignificant
movements of your own holy body. Now, sweet one, be wise.
Cast all your votes for dancing!
