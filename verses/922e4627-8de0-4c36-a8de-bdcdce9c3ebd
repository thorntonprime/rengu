Well planted, not uprooted. Well embraced, never lost. Descendants will
 continue The ancestral rituals.
Maintain oneself： Te becomes real. Maintain the family： Te becomes
 abundant. Maintain the community： Te becomes extensive. Maintain the
 country： Te becomes public. Maintain the world： Te becomes omnipresent.
Therefore, Through self contemplate self, Through family contemplate
 family, Through community contemplate community, Through country
 contemplate country, Through world contemplate world.
How do I know the world? Like this!
