Title: Millennium Blessing
---
There is a grace approaching
that we shun as much as death,
it is the completion of our birth.

It does not come in time,
  but in timelessness
when the mind sinks into the heart
and we remember.

It is an insistent grace that draws us
to the edge and beckons us to surrender
safe territory and enter our enormity.

We know we must pass
  beyond knowing
and fear the shedding.

But we are pulled upward
  none-the-less
through forgotten ghosts
  and unexpected angels,
luminous.

And there is nothing left to say
but we are That.

And that is what we sing about.
