In this state of absorbed contemplation there is no longer question of holding
an object in view; the vision is continuous so that seeing and seen are one;
object and act of vision have become identical; of all that until then filled
the eye no memory remains. The first seeing is of Intellect knowing, the
second that of Intellect in love. ... The vision floods the eyes with light,
but it is not a light showing some other thing, the light is itself the vision.
No longer is there object seen and light to show it, no longer Intellect and
object of Intellection; this is the very Radiance that brought both into being.
