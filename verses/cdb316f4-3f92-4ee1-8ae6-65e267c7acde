Title: We Have Work to Accomplish
---
Most important of all -- Man’s creative vocation to prepare, consciously,
the ultimate triumph of Divine Wisdom. Man, the microcosm, the heart of the
universe, is the one who is called to bring about the fusion of cosmic and
historic processes in the final invocation of God’s wisdom and love. In
the name of Christ and by his power, Man has a work to accomplish -- to
offer the cosmos to the Father, by the power of the Spirit, in the Glory of
the Word. Our life is a powerful Pentecost in which the Holy Spirit, ever
active in us, seeks to reach through our inspired hands and tongues into
the very heart of the material world created to be spiritualized through
the work of the Church, the Mystical Body of the Incarnate Word of God.

If I can unite in myself, in my own spiritual life, the thought of the
East and the West, of the Greek and Latin Fathers, I will create in
myself a reunion of the divided Church, and from that unity in myself
can come the exterior and visible unity of the Church. For if we want to
bring together East and West, we cannot do it by imposing one upon the
other. We must contain both in ourselves and transcend both in Christ.
