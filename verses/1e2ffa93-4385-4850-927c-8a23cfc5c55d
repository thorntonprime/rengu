St Paul descended from the Paradise in the Third Heavens, bringeth this with
him down into the World, as the Sacred Mystery, and rich ground of all Truth,
from which all the Beauties and Sweetnesses of Paradise, of all the Heavens
spring; That Love is the band of Perfection. It is Love then, which runneth
through the whole Work of God, which frameth, informeth, uniteth it all into
one Master piece of Divine Love.

If God be Love, the Attributes of God are the Attributes of this Love; the
Purity, Simplicity, the Soveraignty, the Wisdom, the Almightiness, the
Unchangeableness, the Infiniteness, the eternity of Divine Love. If God be
Love, his Work is the Work of Love, of a Love unmixt, unconfined, supream,
infinite in Wisdom and Power, not limited in its workings by any pre-existent
matter, but bringing forth freely and entirely from it self its whole work both
matter and form, according to its own inclination and complacency in it self.
