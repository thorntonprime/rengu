Taoist rulers of old Did not enlighten people But left them dull.
People are difficult to govern Because they are very clever. Therefore,
 Ruling through cleverness leads to rebellion. Not leading through
 cleverness Brings good fortune.
Know these two things And understanding the enduring pattern. Understand
 the enduring patternï¼š This is called original Te.
Original Te goes deep and far. All things reverse Return And reach the
 great headwaters.
