    Title: The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious
By: C. G. Jung
---
In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly
personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche
(even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists
a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature
which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not
develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms,
the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give
definite form to certain psychic contents.
