Keep thyself detached from all mankind; keep thyself devoid of all incoming
images; emancipate thyself from everything which entails addition, attachment
or encumbrance, and address thy mind at all times to a saving contemplation
wherein thou bearest God fixed within thy heart as the object from which its
eyes do never waver; any other discipline, fasts, vigils, prayers, or
whatever it may be. subordinate to this as to its end. using thereof no more
than shall answer for this purpose, so shalt thou win the goal of all
perfections.
