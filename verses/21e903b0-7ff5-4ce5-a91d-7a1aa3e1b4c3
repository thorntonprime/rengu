You hide your boat in the ravine and your fish net in the swamp and
tell yourself that they will be safe. But in the middle of the night a
strong man shoulders them and carries them off, and in your stupidity
you don't know why it happened. You think you do right to hide little
things in big ones, and yet they get away from you. But if you were to
hide the world in the world, so that nothing could get away, this would
be the final reality of the constancy of things.
