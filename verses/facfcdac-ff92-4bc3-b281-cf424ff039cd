The Universal Harmony records various wonders, and it saysï¼š "When the
P'eng journeys to the southern darkness, the waters are roiled for
three thousand li. He beats the whirlwind and rises ninety thousand li,
setting off on the sixth month gale." Wavering heat, bits of dust,
living things blowing each other about-the sky looks very blue. Is that
its real color, or is it because it is so far away and has no end? When
the bird looks down, all he sees is blue too.
