“Longevity and radiance." I would add “infinite potential.” A monk
asked Zhaozhou. “Does a newborn baby also have the sixth consciousness of
mind?" (Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.) Zhaozhou answered. “It‘s
like tossing a ball on swift flowing water." The monk also asked Master
Touzi, a contemporary of Zhaozhou, “What is the meaning of tossing a ball
on swift flowing water?" Touzi said. “Moment to moment, nonstop flow." Each
and every moment alive and present, and containing the whole universe.
