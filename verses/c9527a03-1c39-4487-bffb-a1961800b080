Those turbulent and unruly, uncertain and unconstant motions of
passion and self-will that dwell in degenerate minds, divide them
perpetually from themselves, and are always moulding several factions
and tumultuous combinations within them against the dominion of
reason. And the only way to unite man firmly to himself is by uniting
him to God. and establishing in him a firm amity and agreement with
the first and primitive being.
