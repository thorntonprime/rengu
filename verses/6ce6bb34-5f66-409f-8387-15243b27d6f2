Title: My Art of Confession and Witness
---
The work of writing can be for me, or very close to, the simple job of
being： by creative reflection and awareness to help life itself live in
me, to give its esse an existent, or to find a place, rather, in esse by
action, intelligence, and love. For to write is to love： it is to inquire
and to praise, to confess and to appeal. This testimony of love remains
necessary. Not to reassure myself that I am (“I write, therefore I am”),
but simply to pay my debt to life, to the world, to other men. To speak
out with an open heart and say what seems to me to have meaning. The bad
writing I have done has all been authoritarian, the declaration of musts,
and the announcement of punishments. Bad because it implies a lack oflove,
good insofar as there may yet have been some love in it. The best stuff
has been more straight confession and witness.
