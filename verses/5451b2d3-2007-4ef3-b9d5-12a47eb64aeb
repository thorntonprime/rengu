Commentary: The "Thought of Enlightenment” (Bodhi chitta) is to
  the Maháyina what “grace” is to Christian theology.

This Thought of Enlightenment has arisen within me I know not how,
even as a gem might be gotten by a blind man from a dunghill; it is an
elixir made to destroy death in the world, an unfailing treasure to
relieve the world’s poverty, a supreme balm to allay the world’s
sickness, a tree under which may rest all creatures wearied with
wandering over life’s paths, a bridge open to all wayfarers for
passing over hard ways, a moon of thought arising to cool the fever of
the world’s sin, a great sun driving away the gloom of the world’s
ignorance, a fresh butter created by the churning of the milk of the
Good Law. For the caravan of beings who wander through life’s paths
hungering to taste of happiness this banquet of bliss is prepared,
that will satisfy all creatures coming to it.
