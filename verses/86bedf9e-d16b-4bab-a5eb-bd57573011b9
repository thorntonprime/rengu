Since the drum is often the only instrument used in our sacred rites, I should
perhaps tell you here why it is especially sacred and important to us. It is
because the round form of the drum represents the whole universe, and its
steady strong beat is the pulse, the heart, throbbing at the center of the
universe. It is as the voice of Wakan-Tanka, and this sound stirs us and helps
us to understand the mystery and power of all things.
