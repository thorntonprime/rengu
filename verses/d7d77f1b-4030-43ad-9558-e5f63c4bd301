A grain of wheat has the air and light of this world enclosed or
incorporated in it. ... On the other hand, that great ocean of light
and air. having its own offspring hidden in the heart of the grain,
has a perpetual strong tendency to unite and communicate with it
again. ... But here let it be well observed that this desire on both
sides cannot have its effect till the husk and gross part of the grain
falls into a state of corruption and death; till this begins, the
mystery of life hidden in it cannot come forth. The application here
may be left to the reader.
