Title: Sublime Generosity
Description: September 14-15
---
I was dead, then alive.
Weeping, then laughing.

The power of love came into me,
and I became fierce like a lion,
then tender like the evening star.

He said, You are not mad enough.
You don't belong in this house.

I went wild and had to be tied up.
He said, Still not wild enough to stay with us.

I broke through another layer into joyfulness.
He said, It is not enough. I died.

He said, You are a clever little man
full of fantasy and doubting.

I plucked out my feathers and became a fool.
He said, Now you are the candle for this assembly.

But I'm no candle. Look. I'm scattered smoke.

He said, You are the sheikh, the guide.
But I am not a teacher. I have no power.

He said, You already have wings.
I cannot give you wings.

But I wanted his wings.
I felt like some flightless chicken.

Then new events said to me,
Don't move. A sublime generosity
is coming toward you.

And old love said, Stay with me.
I said, I will.

You are the fountain of the sun's light.
I am a willow shadow on the ground.
You make my raggedness silky.
