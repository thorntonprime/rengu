The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His ways, before He made anything,
from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of old. before the earth
was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived; neither had
the fountains of waters as yet sprung out; the mountains with their huge bulk
had not as yet been established; before the hills I was brought forth; He had
not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world. When He
prepared the heavens. I was there; when with a certain law and compass He
enclosed the depths; when He established the sky above, and poised the
fountains of waters; when He compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law
to the waters that they should not pass their limits; when He balanced the
foundations of the earth, I was with him. forming all things, and was delighted
every day, playing before Him at all times, playing in the world; and my
delight is to be with the children of men He that shall find me shall find
life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.
