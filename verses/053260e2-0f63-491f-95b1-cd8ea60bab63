If a householder gives in charity in a spirit of detachment, he is
really doing good to himself and not to others. It is God alone that
he serves -- God, who dwells in all beings; and when he serves God, he
is really doing good to himself and not to others Helping others,
doing good to others -- this is the work of God alone, who for men has
created the sun and moon, father and mother, fruits, flowers, and
corn. The love that you see in parents is God’s love： He has given it
to them to preserve His creation. The compassion that you see in the
kind-hearted is God’s compassion： He has given it to them to protect
the helpless. Whether you are charitable or not, He will have His work
done somehow or other. Nothing can stop His work.

What then is man’s duty? What else can it be? It is just to take
refuge in God and to pray to Him with a yearning heart for His vision.
