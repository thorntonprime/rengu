The greatest secret of our operation is no other than a cohobation of
the nature of one thing above the other, until the most digested
virtue be extracted out of the digested body of the crude one. But
there are hereto requisiteï¼š Firstly, an exact measurement and
preparation of the ingredients required; secondly, an exact fulfilment
of all external conditions; thirdly, a proper regulation of the fire;
fourthly, a good knowledge of the natural properties of the
substances; and fifthly, patience, in order that the work may not be
marred by overgreat haste.
