Tzu-kung traveled south to Ch'u, and on his way back through Chin, as
he passed along the south bank of the Han, he saw an old man preparing
his fields for planting. He had hollowed out an opening by which he
entered the well and from which he emerged, lugging a pitcher, which he
carried out to water the fields. Grunting and puffing, he used up a
great deal of energy and produced very little result.
