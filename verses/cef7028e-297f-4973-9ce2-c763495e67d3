Title: Dreams and Cares
---
Last night my cares lasted so long
I thought my dreams as long.
So I set off to see you
but awoke before reaching halfway.

At dawn my dreams were so short
I thought my cares as short.
But worry after worry --
I donâ€™t know when it will end.

My love, if you also
have dreams and cares,
I would rather that your cares
turn into dreams and dreams into cares.
