Title: A Star with No Name
---
When a baby is taken from the wet nurse,
it easily forgets her and starts eating solid food.

Seeds feed awhile on the ground,
then lift up into the sun.
So you should taste filtered light
and work toward that which has no personal covering.

That's how you came here, like a star with no name.
Move in the night sky with those anonymous lights.
