When the soul becomes freed from everything external and is united with
prayer, then prayer like a flame envelops it, as fire envelops iron and makes
it all fiery. Then the soul, though still the same soul, like red hot iron,
can no longer be touched by anything external. ... Blessed is the man who,
while still in this life, has been granted this appearance and who himself
sees his image, perishable by nature, become fiery through grace.
