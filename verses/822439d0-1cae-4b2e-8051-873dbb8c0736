Title: A Preference for the Chant of Frogs
---
Warmer. Rain in the night. Frogs again. At first the waterhole (four feet
long at most) had one frog or two. Now they are a small nation, loud in
the night.The innocent nation, chanting blissfully in praise of the spring
rain. Last evening I pruned a few little trees -- including the beeches
I had planted.

Today I have to go down to see Fr. Vernon Robertson, who evidently
wants me to get involved in something -- and I will try not to. He has
been pestering me to come to Louisville to give a talk at Bellarmine
College. And this is confirming me in my resolution to keep out of all that.

Almost every day I have to write a letter to someone refusing an invitation
to attend a conference, or a workshop, or to give talks on the contemplative
life, or poetry, etc. I can see more and more clearly how for me this
would be a sheer waste, a Pascalian diversion, participation in a common
delusion. (For others, no： they have the grace and mission to go around
talking.) For me what matters is silence, meditation -- and writing：
but writing is secondary. To willingly and deliberately abandon this to
go out and talk would be stupidity -- for me. And for others, retirement
into my kind of solitude would be equally stupid.They could not do it --
and I could not do what they do
