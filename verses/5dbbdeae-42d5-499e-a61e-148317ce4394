Title: But the Silence in the Mind
---
But the silence in the mind
is when we live best, within
listenining distance of the silence
we call God. This is the deep
calling to deep of the psalm-
weiter, the bottomless ocean
We launch the armada of
our thoughts on, never arriving.

It is a presence, then,
whose margins are our margins;
that calls us out over our
own fathoms. What to do
but draw a little nearer to
such ubiquity by remaining still?
