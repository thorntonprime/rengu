    Title: Does God Exist?
By: Hans Kung

It is precisely the apparently merely “metaphysical” question about
the nature of God, as discussed between East and West, precisely the
question about the personal or nonpersonal nature of God, that decides
what practical attitude toward him is possible： whether -- to recall
Heidegger -- we can pray and offer sacrifice to him, kneel in awe before
him, sing and dance before him.
