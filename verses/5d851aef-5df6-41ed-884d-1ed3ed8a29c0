Here take note that thou canst contemplate God in His creatures, which
He has made out of nothing, whereby thou art able to discover His
omnipotence. But when thou seest and considerest how admirably the
creatures are fashioned and put together, and in what wonderful order
they are arranged, thou art able to perceive and trace the Wisdom of
God, which is ascribed to the Son.
