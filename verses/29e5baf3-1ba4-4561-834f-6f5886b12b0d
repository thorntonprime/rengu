Title: Being in One Place
---
A cool and lovely morning, clear sky, ever-changing freshness of woods
and valley! One has to be in the same place every day, watch the dawn
from the same house, hear the same birds wake each morning to realize how
inexhaustibly rich and different is “sameness.” This is the blessing
of stability, and I think it is not evident until you enjoy it alone in
a hermitage. The common life distracts you from life in its fullness. But
one must be able to share this fullness, and I am not for a complete and
absolute solitude without communication (except temporarily).

Yesterday was St. Bede’s day (he died on Ascension Day, 735). He is one
of the saints I most love, and the simple story of his life and death
fill me with love and joy. The afternoon was peaceful and marvelous --
a nice walk and meditation at St. Malachy’s field, then came back and
gave a conference on Philoxenus. The simplicity and innocence of the monks
is a real joy, a shining joy, so evident one does not notice it. Yet I
must say that concelebration in the morning did nothing to express the
reality of love and oneness in Christ that is actually here. The singing
was timid and depressing, and I must say that we are not anywhere near
properly realizing and manifesting What it is all about.

The flycatchers, tamer and tamer, play about on the chairs and baskets on
my porch, right in front of this window, and they are enthralling. Wrens
come too, less frequently.
