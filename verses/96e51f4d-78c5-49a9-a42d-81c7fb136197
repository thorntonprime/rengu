Title: Love Between Two People
Description: May 30

No area of human existence is so burdened with conventions as love between two
people. There are life-preservers of the most varied invention, life-boats and
safety vests; society has fashioned rescue strategies of every description.
Since it has chosen to take love as an easy pleasure, it must make it as cheap
and as safe as all public amusements should be.
