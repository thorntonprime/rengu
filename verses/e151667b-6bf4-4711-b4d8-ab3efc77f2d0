Again, as the substance of the earthly Stone is nothing accounted of
in the world, and rejected by the majority of mankind, so Christ, the
eternal Word of the Father, and the Heavenly Triune Stone, is lightly
esteemed in this world, and scarcely even looked at; nay, we may say
that nothing is so profoundly and utterly despised by mankind, as the
Saving Word of God.
