Do not delay lest you become worthless. Find a teacher as soon as
possible, in order that you may acquire the principle of hsuan
(mystery). If you do not learn the truth in your present life, how
will you know in what womb you are going to be born in the next life?
When you have decided to take up the subject, you must stick to it
through to the end. The greatest of human events are life and death.
