Title: Your First Work
---
You flow into all that is, creatures
and things, high and low, things

in the heavens and things here
below, and do this not because

You have any need of them or
of me, but because You cannot

do other and in this inflowing
give to each and every creature

and to me the capacity to work,
and Your first work is the heart.
