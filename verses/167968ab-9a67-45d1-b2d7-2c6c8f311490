Who can finde such a Master out.
As was my Master, him needeth not to doubt：
Which right nobil was and fully worthy laude.
He loved Justice, and he abhorred fraude;
He was full secrete when other men were lowde,
Loath to be knowne that hereof ought he Could：
When men disputed of Colours of the Rose,
He would not speake but keepe himselfe full close;
To whome I laboured long and many a day,
But he was solleyn to prove with straight assaye.
To search and know of my Disposition,
With manifold proofes to know my Condition：
And when he found unfeigned fidelity.
In my greate hope which yet nothing did see,
At last I conquered by grace divine
His love, which did to me incline.
