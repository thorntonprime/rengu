This assumption that she need look for no more devotion now that her beauty
had passed proceeded from the fact that she had never realized any love
save love as passion, Such love, though it expends itself in generosity
and thoughtfulness, though it give birth to visions and to great poetry,
remains among the sharpest expressions of self-interest, Not until it
has passed through a long servitude, through its own self-hatred, through
mockery, through great doubts, can it take its place among the loyalties,
Many who have spent a lifetime in it can tell us less of love than the
child that lost a dog yesterday.
