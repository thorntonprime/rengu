  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
The fact is that he [Andre Gide] brings to each a new strength. One of
the strongest elements of the influence he exerts is the persuasive and
intoxicating encouragement he gives us to persevere, resolutely and happily,
each in his own being; and to demand of ourselves the most particular, the
most authentic, the best. ... He has the gift of sharpening each man's
critical sense and of increasing his insight, without diminishing his
fervor. He does more： he exalts in others -- not pride, certainly, and I
don't know quite how to put it： an upright vision of self; a confidence,
a modest confidence in oneself.
