Title: Recognition
---
The word spread about something her eyes began to whisper, and many gathered to
 receive her great gifts when her gaze turned their way.
And it did, for she looked upon all who came close to her as if she were seeing
 God. It was hard to believe the welcome she gave, but I guess that was
 natural, with her really knowing you.
What the sun in the sky can do for the earth, give it life as it does,
so can the eye bestow an equal grace to the heart when its vision naturally
 caresses a face out of recognition.
Who then does not know a moment of happiness? And more than that ... then dance
 in some way, because of gratitude.
