Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
\"Well, then - mind-nourishment!" said Big Concealment.  "You have
only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash
your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a
thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep
and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless,
and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root - return
to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos - to the
end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you
have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try
to observe its form. Things will live naturally and of themselves."
