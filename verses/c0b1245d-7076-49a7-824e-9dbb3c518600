Here a question arisesï¼š Did the disciples in this highest school of the Spirit
obtain an insight into all those sciences which are learnt in the school of
nature? I answer. Yes; it was given them to understand all science, whether
touching the courses of the heavenly bodies, or what not, in so far as it might
conduce to God's glory, or concerned the salvation of man; but those points of
science which bear no fruit for the soul, they were not given to know.
