Tao is the mysterious center of all things, a treasure for those who are
 good, A refuge for those who are not.
Beautiful words can be traded, Noble deeds can enhance reputations, But if
 people lack them, Why should they be rejected?
When the Son of Heaven is enthroned And the Three Ministers installed,
 Presenting jade discs And four-horse chariots Cannot compare to sitting
 still And offering the Tao.
The ancients honoured this Tao. Didn't they sayï¼š Through it seekers find,
 Through it the guilty escape? This is why Tao is honoured under Heaven.
