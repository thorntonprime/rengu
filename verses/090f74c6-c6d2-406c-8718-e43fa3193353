There are times when we act with unshakable faith in the Dharma even though
we don’t understand the situation we’re in. There are other times when we
understand our situation but are afraid to be completely faithful.

In one instance, we have heart; and in the other we have mind. We must put
these two together! Understanding AND faith!
