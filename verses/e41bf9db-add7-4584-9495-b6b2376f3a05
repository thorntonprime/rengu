Title: The Exuberant Confusion
---
A tree of fragrance from a garden rose,
the friend is the taste of this elaborate, particulate universe
and of the spirit that informs and streams beyond it.

An ash sapling and the stars wonder about the sun
as fish explore the restlessness they live withing.

You turn faces toward light.
Joseph coming after so many years.
Khidr offering springwater.

Why are you still hidden?
Say openly where and who we are,
you, grace and content of the seen and unseen,
you this exuberant confusion.

What kind of love is this
where the heart's eloquence and the day it is heard
keep explaining again
how the whole ocean makes a single pearl?
