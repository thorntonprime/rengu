Every word carries a vibration that sent out, comes back. A cutting word
destroys what a sweet word heals. One spoken word can make or mar the
destiny of a being. When heart is put into a word, the word encompasses the
totality of love and brings love back. When a word is without heart, it is
cold and empty and will bring back cold and emptiness.
