If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been
churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be
done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree; such a
hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple.
