Tao bears them Te nurses them Events form them Energy completes them.
 Therefore the ten thousand beings Honour Tao and respect Te. Tao is
 honoured Te is respected Because they do not give orders But endure in
 their own nature. Therefore, Tao bears them and Te nurses them, Rears
 them, Raises them, Shelters them, Nurtures them, Supports them, Protects
 them.
Bears them without owning them, Helps them without coddling them, Rears
 them without ruling them. This is called original Te.
