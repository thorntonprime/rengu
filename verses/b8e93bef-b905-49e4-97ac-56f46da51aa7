The bound souls never think of God. If they get any leisure they
indulge in idle gossip and foolish talk, or they engage in fruitless
work. If you ask one of them the reason, he answers, ‘Oh, I cannot
keep still; so I am making a hedge.’ When time hangs heavy on their
hands they perhaps start playing cards.
