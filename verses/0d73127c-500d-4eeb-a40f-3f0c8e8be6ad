Through all of my travels, Friend,
You feed me until my journey ends.
You are my companion on the path,
my breath, my hope.
And it is You who gives me joy.
It is You who feeds my hunger,
and You who walks with me to my journey's end.
You alone do I long for.
You alone are my treasure.
You alone are my life and my love,
for without You I could not have wandered the world.
You have done so much for me through your grace --
so many favors, so many gifts.
I seek Your love everywhere, and suddenly,
I am filled with it.
You dwell in my heart.
You are the glow in my eyes.
And my soul has but one desitreï¼š
to be one with You.
