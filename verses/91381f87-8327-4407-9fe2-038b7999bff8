Description: The Sioux Inipi Rite of Purification
---
\â€˜We shall burn the sweet grass as an offering to Wakan-Tanka, and the
fragrance of this will spread throughout heaven and earth; it will make the
four-leggeds, the wingeds, the star peoples of the heavens, and all things as
relatives. From You, O Grandmother Earth, who are lowly, and who support us as
does a mother, this fragrance will go forth; may its power be felt throughout
the universe, and may it purify the feet and hands of the two-leggeds, that
they may walk forward upon the sacred earth, raising their heads to
Wakan-Tanka!'
