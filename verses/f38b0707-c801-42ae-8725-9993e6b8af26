We the human family are not all philosophers. We are of the earth very
earthy, and we are not satisfied with contemplating the Infinite God. Somehow
or other we want something which we can touch, something which we can see,
something before which we can kneel down. It does not matter whether it
is a book, or an empty stone building or a stone building inhabited by
numerous figures. A book will satisfy some, an empty building will satisfy
some others, and many others will not be satisfied unless the see something
inhabiting these empty buildings.
