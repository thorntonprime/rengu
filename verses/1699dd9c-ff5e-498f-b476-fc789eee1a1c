Title: Heaven And Earth
---
HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE HUGE, but they are alike in their transformations.
The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good
order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the
sovereign. The sovereign finds his source in Virtue, his completion in
Heaven. Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled
the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more.
