Only the truly intelligent understand this principle of the identity of all
things. They do not view things as apprehended by themselves, subjectively;
but transfer themselves into the position of the things viewed. And viewing
them thus they are able to comprehend them, nay, to master them;-and he who
can master them is near. So it is that to place oneself in subjective relation
with externals, without consciousness of their objectivity, -- this is TAO.
