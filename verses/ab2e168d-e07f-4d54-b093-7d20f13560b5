We live in a world of unplumbed wonder
And everything around us is alive and pregnant with possibilities
But we fail each other and we fail ourselves
By seeing only the familiar and tried and true
And leaving things be as they are
And falling asleep.

Awake! Awake! Awake!
Look around you and take it in your hands!
Shake off your sickness and release your vendetta!
Forget your habits and seize your opportunities!
The essence of life is in your breast and your mind!
Do great things now! Today! Here!
