I believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world. I
believe that they are all God-given and I believe that they were necessary
for the people to whom these religions were revealed. And I believe that
if only we could all of us read the scriptures of the different faiths
from the standpoint of the followers of these faiths, we should find that
they were at the bottom all one and were all helpful to one another.
