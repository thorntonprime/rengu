    Title: Thirty Years to Instant Enlightenment

Format: verse
By: Shen Tsan
Title: The Door is Open
Commentary: |
  Shen Tsan (T’ang Dynasty) was a native of Southeast China. The original
  poem, a well known one, features a pun on the similarities of books and
  windows (both made of paper, in T’ang China). It took me years to get
  over the fact that I couldn’t translate the pun. Go figure.

Door’s open： why can’t you get your butts out?
Maybe pile up your books, and climb out the window?
A life time you’ve been pondering that paper-pile!
When, (oh, when?), you gonna get your heads out?
