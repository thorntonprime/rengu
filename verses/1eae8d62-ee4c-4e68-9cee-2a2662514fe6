In the search for truth there are certain questions that are not
important. Of what material is the universe constructed? Is the universe
eternal? Are there limits or not to the universe? What is the ideal form
of organization for human society? If a man were to postpone his search
and practice for Enlightenment until such questions were solved, he would
die before he found the path.
