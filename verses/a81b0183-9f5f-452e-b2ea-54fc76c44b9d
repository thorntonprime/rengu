Title: The Miracle of Darkness
Description: July 7
---
Now, with illuminating spheres appearing wherever I turn and something even
 greater,
tell me God, more of your miracle of darkness I can see in other lives.
I once cried for what was not in my hand, not knowing it was there.
Finally you pointed out my fantastic misconception and corrected it.
Darkness, would be a miracle to me now, my head having become pure fire.
