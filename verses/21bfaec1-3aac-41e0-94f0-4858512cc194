A fire can be extinguished; but the flame of desire is never extinguished.
Pains affect the body for a while, then cease, and leave you at rest; but
from the pain of desire you never get rest, unless you cure it by the
medicine of true intelligence (vors), and put desire away from you, and
learn to abstain; for desire grows in strength if you follow it, but dies
away if you turn from it and abstain.
