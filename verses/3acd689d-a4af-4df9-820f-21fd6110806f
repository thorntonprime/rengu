Title: To Kyewŏrhyang
---
Kyewŏrhyang, you sleep in a bed of earth,
your beautiful and frightening smile still alive.
I mourn for your humanity and love your cruelty.

The fishermen of the Taedong River hear your song;
the revelers on Mount Moran see your face.
The children cry your living name;
the poets sing your bygone shadow.

We are fated to die, regretting what’s undone.
What are your regrets?
You keep silent.

Your regret’s redness turns into a brilliant sunset,
  blocking the sky and reversing the bleakness of falling day.
Your sorrow’s blueness lengthens into willow threads,
  tethering the departing spring from its destined path.

I’ll catch the morning sun on a golden tray,
fold the new spring into an apricot branch
  and lay them gently where you sleep.
They’ll remain' one night or last the winter,
  my beloved Kyewŏrhyang.
