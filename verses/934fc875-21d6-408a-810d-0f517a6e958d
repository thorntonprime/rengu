The Eternal Religion, the religion of the rishis, has been in
existence from time out of mind and will exist eternally. There exist
in this Sanâtana Dharma all forms of worship -- worship of God with
form and worship of the Impersonal Deity as well. It contains all
paths -- the path of knowledge, the path of devotion, and so on. Other
forms of religion, the modern cults, will remain for a few days and
then disappear.
