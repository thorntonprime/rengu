God longs as urgently for thee to go out of thyself in respect of thy
creaturely nature as though his whole felicity depended on it. Why, man, what
is the harm of letting God be God in thee? Go clean out of thy self for Godâ€™s
sake, and God will go clean out of his for thy sake. Both being gone out, what
remains is simply the one.
