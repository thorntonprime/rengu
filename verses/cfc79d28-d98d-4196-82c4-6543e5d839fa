A human being is part of the whole called by us 'universe.'
a part limited in time ans space.
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings
as something separated from the rest --
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.

This delusion is a kind of prison for us,
restricting us to our personal desires
and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison
by widening our circle of compassion
to embrace all living creatures
and the whole of nature in its beauty.
