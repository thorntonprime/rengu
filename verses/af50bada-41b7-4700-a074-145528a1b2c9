The heart of the gnostic possesses such an amplitude that Abû Yazîd
al-Bistâmî said of it; if the divine Throne with all that surrounds it were
to be found a hundred million times in a corner of the heart of the gnostic,
he would not feel it; and Junayd said in the same sense; if the ephemeral and
the eternal are joined, there remains no further trace of the former; now, how
could the heart which contains the eternal feel the existence of the ephemeral?
