The soldiers in the castle, seeing our men come on them with great fury,
did all they could to defend themselves, and killed and wounded many of our
soldiers with pikes, arquebuses, and stones, whereby the surgeons had all
their work cut out for them. Now I was at this time a fresh-water soldier;
I had not yet seen wounds made by gunshot at the first dressing. It is true
I had read in John de Vigo, first book, Of Wounds in General, eighth chapter,
that wounds made by firearms partake of venomosity, by reason of the powder;
and for their cure he bids you cauterize them with oil of elders scalding hot,
mixed with a little treacle. And to make no mistake, before I would use the
said oil, knowing this was to bring great pain to the patient, I asked first
before I applied it, what the other surgeons did for the first dressing;
which was to put the said oil, boiling well, into the wounds, with tents
and setons; wherefore I took courage to do as they did. At last my oil ran
short, and I was forced instead thereof to apply a digestive made of the
yolk of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine. In the night I could not sleep
in quiet, fearing some default in not cauterizing, that I should find the
wounded to whom I had not used the said oil dead from the poison of their
wounds; which made me rise very early to visit them, where beyond my ex-
pectation I found that those to whom I had applied my digestive medicant had
but little pain, and their wounds without inflammation or swelling, having
rested fairly well that night; the others, to whom the boiling oil was used,
I found feverish, with great pain and swelling about the edges of their wounds.
Then I resolved never more to burn thus cruelly poor men with gunshot wounds.
