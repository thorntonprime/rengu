Title: A Villa at Lu-Lung Village on an Autumn Day
---
Reject these worldly cares,
Walk leisurely with village idlers.
Sound of the trees; evening comes to the village inn.
Tinted grass, autumn comes to the old city.
Solitary bird streaks across the sky;
Lazy clouds pass over the dyke.
Don't ask who I am;
The hill, the trees, the empty boat.
