Cold Mountain Road's a joke,
no cart track, no horse trail.
Creeks like veins, but still it's hard to mark
the twists. Fields and fields of crags for crops,
it's hard to say how many.
Tears of dew upon a thousand kinds of grasses;
the wind sings best in one kind of pine.
And now I've lost my way againï¼š
Body asking shadow, "Which way from here?"
