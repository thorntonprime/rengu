The challenge of master Suio is in his poem： “This ax of mine does away
with people‘s incompleteness." What is it that stands in the way of one's
own completeness? The truth ofour lives is that we are born complete and
we will die complete, whether we realize it or not. However, to realize
it makes the journey from life to death one of ease and freedom, instead
of one of pain and suffering. The reason there is pain and suffering is
because we have adorned our completeness with the ten thousand illusions
that we create and cling to. Suio's ax cuts away the extra until only
the completeness remains. The cut ting edge ofthat ax is the study of the
self. The completeness is the forgetting of the self The ease and freedom
is the realization of the ten thousand things as one's own body and mind.
