This world is an outer court of Eternity, and therefore it may well be
called a Paradise, for it is such in truth. And in this Paradise, all
things are lawful, save one tree and the fruits thereof. That is to
say： of all things that are. nothing is forbidden and nothing is
contrary to God but one thing only： that is, self-will, or to will
otherwise than as the Eternal Will would have it. ... And could a man,
while on earth, be wholly quit of self-will and ownership, and stand
up free and at large in God's true light, and continue therein, he
would be sure of the Kingdom of Heaven.
