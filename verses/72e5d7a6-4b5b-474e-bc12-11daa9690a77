It needs but a little to overthrow and destroy everything -- just a
slight aberration from reason. For the helmsman to wreck his vessel,
he does not need the same resources, as he needs to save it： if he
turn it but a little too far to the wind, he is lost： yes, and if he
do it not deliberately but from mere want of attention, he is lost all
the same.  ... Keep awake then and watch your impressions： it is no
trifle you have in keeping.
