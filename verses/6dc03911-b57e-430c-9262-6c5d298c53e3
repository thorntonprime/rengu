Title: Which Is Real?
---
Your signless love circles my youth like a faintly swaying gauze curtain
 that wraps itself around a young girl’s dream.
Pulsating -- young bloods dance to heaven’s clear music.
Panting -- little souls sleep in the shade of heaven’s falling flowers.

Endless threads of attachment bind my sleep,
 as spring rain turns to blue haze amid the drooping willows.
A short dream struggles under the quilt, trying to follow the wind.
Desperate dream-cries stifle my throat, calling to people
 across the river.
Shattered moonbeams splinter dew-wet flowers like broken rice,
 and the bitterness of your parting turns into a sharp knife
 that cuts me to the bone.
The stream outside the gate doesn’t need my tears
 to swell its flow.
The mad wind in the spring hills waits for my sighs
and gathers strength to shake the flowers.
