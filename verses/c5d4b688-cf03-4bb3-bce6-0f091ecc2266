Act without acting. Serve without serving. Taste without tasting.
Big, little, Many, few, Repay hatred with Te.
Map difficult with easy Approach great through narrow.
The most difficult things in the world Must be accomplished through the
 easiest. The greatest things in the world Must be accomplished through the
 smallest.
Therefore the Sage Never attempts great things and so accomplishes them.
Quick promises Mean little trust. Everything easy Means great difficulty.
Thus for the Sage everything is difficult, And so in the end Nothing is
 difficult.
