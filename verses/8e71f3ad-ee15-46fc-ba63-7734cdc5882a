Title: The Ancient One
---
At the bottom,
the ancient one,
tangled root of all that has been,
forgotten fountain left unseen.

Helmet's and hunters' horns,
old men muttering,
brothers betrayed,
women played upon.

Branch thrusts upon branch,
nowhere a free one.
Yes, up there! Keep climbing!

See if they'll hold you.
That high one bends already
to become a lyre.
