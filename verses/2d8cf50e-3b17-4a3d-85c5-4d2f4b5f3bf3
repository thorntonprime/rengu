A Monk asked Zhaozhou, "For a long time, [I've heard] the report of
Zhaozhou's stone elevated-bridge. [I've] arrived only to see a rough
bridge. "

Zhou said, "You only see the rough bridge. For the time being you do
not see the stone elevated-bridge."

The monk said, "So what is the stone elevated-bridge?"

Zhou said, "It ferries across donkeys; it ferries across horses, the
bridge."
