If the vine dresser be not skilled in his art, he is as likely to crop off
the good branches which bear grapes as the wild shoots, and thus spoil the
vineyard. So it is with those who do not understand this spiritual art; they
leave the roots of vice and evil dispositions alive in the heart, and hew and
lop at poor nature, and thereby destroy this noble vineyard.
