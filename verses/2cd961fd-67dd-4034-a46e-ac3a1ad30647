\[Yuanwu's] Appended pointer says：

Where there is a Buddha do not get there and stop; to
stop manifests a life of horns on the head. Where there is no Buddha,
quickly run by; if you do not run by, the grass is ten feet deep. If
you are abundantly upright, all naked and clean, all washed and red,
with external affairs being without machinations, and the external
being without affairs, you do not escape sticking by the stump waiting
for a rabbit.

Just say, altogether, is treading the living walk not
like this or is it like this? A test is raised for examination：

There was a time Changqing said, "I would rather there
be talk about arhats having the three poisons; don't talk about the
Tathagata having two kinds of language. I don't say the Tathagata is
without language, only is without two types of language."

Baofu said, "How do you make it alive to be the
Tathagata's language?"

Qing said "A deaf person struggles to be able to hear."

Baofu said, "I know for sure you are facing towards the
Way of the second head."

Qing said, "How do you make it alive to be the
Tathagata's language?"

Baofu said, "Go drink tea."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

Oh, the heads! First. Second.

A resting dragon does not reflect on the still water.

Having the moon without a place, the waves settle.

Having a place, the billows rise up without a wind.

Zen traveler Leng, Zen traveler Leng!

In the third month at the Dragon Gate of Yu, he incurred a spot on the
forehead.
