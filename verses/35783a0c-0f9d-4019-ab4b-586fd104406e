When the Reign of Jupiter comes to an end (towards the close of the fourth
month) you will see the sign of the waxing moon (Crescent), and know that the
whole Reign of Jupiter was devoted to the purification of the Laton. The
mundifying spirit is very pure and brilliant, but the body that has to be
cleansed is intensely black. While it passes from blackness to whiteness, a
great variety of colours are observed; nor is it at once perfectly white; at
first it is simply white -- afterwards it is of a dazzling, snowy splendour.
Under this Reign the whole mass presents the appearance of liquid quicksilver.
This is called the sealing of the mother in the belly of the infant whom she
bears. ... Whenever you look at it you will have cause for astonishment,
particularly when you see it all divided into beautiful but very minute grains
of silver, like the rays of the Sun. This is the White Tincture, glorious to
behold, but nothing in respect of what it may become.
