Though you be as a Tree twice dead, & pull’d up by the rootes, Hee can make
you to live, & to grow, being Himselfe a Roote, and the Power of an Endless
Life in you If you fall as a Man, ly not in yor filth as a beast： Defend
not evill, give not yorself up to a rage in it, to an enmity against the
Good, to a despair of ever being better, like a Devill.
