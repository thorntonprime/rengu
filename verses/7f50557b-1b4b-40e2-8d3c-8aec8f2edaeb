(God) is never wanting to those that seek after him, and never fails
those that engage in his quarrels. While we strive against sin, we may
safely expect that the Divinity itself will strive with us, and derive
that strength and power into us that shall at last make us more than
conquerors As he who projects wickedness, shall be sure to find Satan
standing at his right hand ready to assist him in itï¼š so he that
pursues after God and holiness, shall find God nearer to him that he
is to himself, in the free and liberal communications of himself to
him. He that goes out in God's battles, fighting under our Saviour's
banner, may look upwards, and opening his eyes may see the mountains
full of horses and chariots of fire round about him. God hath not so
much delight in the death and destruction of men, as to see them
struggling and contending for life, and himself stand by as a looker
on.
