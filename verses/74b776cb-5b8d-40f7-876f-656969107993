Title: Grainy Taste
---
Without a net, I catch a falcon
and release it to the sky,
hunting God.

This wine I drink today
was never held in a clay jar.

I love this world,
even as I hear the great wind
of leaving it rising,

for there is a grainy taste I prefer
to every idea of heavenï¼š
human friendship.
