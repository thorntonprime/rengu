The raft on which you are borne upon this great sea (of earthly life)
is made of water frozen to ice; and it is only by chance that it
serves to bear you. Soon the sun will rise and shine on it, and melt
the ice, and it will turn into water again, and you will be left
sitting on water. But you certainly will not be able to remain in that
position; you must therefore look for something to bear you up. And
there is nothing that will serve that purpose, except ability to swim
and to direct your course aright until you shall have reached (firm
ground).
