Shen-t'u Chia said, "People who excuse their faults and claim they
didn't deserve to be punished - there are lots of them. But those who
don't excuse their faults and who admit they didn't deserve to be
spared - they are few. To know what you can't do anything about, and to
be content with it as you would with fate - only a man of virtue can do
that. If you play around in front of Archer Yi's target, you're right
in the way of the arrows, and if you don't get hit, it's a matter of
fate. There are lots of men with two feet who laugh at me for having
only one. It makes me boil with rage, but I come here to the Master's
place and I feel calmed down again and go home. I don't know whether he
washes me clean with goodness, or whether I come to understand things
by myself. The Master and I have been friends for nineteen years and
he's never once let on that he's aware I'm missing a foot. Now you and
I are supposed to be wandering outside the realm of forms and bodies,
and you come looking for me inside it - you're at fault, aren't you?"
