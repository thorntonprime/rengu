    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: The One Who Is Coming
---
Why not think of God as the one who is coming, who is moving toward us
from all eternity, the Future One, culminating fruit of the tree whose
leaves we are? What stops you from projecting his birth on times to
come and living your life as a painful and beautiful day in the
history of an immense pregnancy? Do you not see how all that is
happening is ever again a new beginning? And could it not be His
Beginning, for to commence is ever in itself a beautiful thing. If he
is to be fulfillment, then all that is lesser must precede him, so
that he can fashion himself from out of the greatest abundance. Must
he not be last, in order to include everything within himself? And
what meaning would be ours, if he, for whom we yearn, had already
existed?
