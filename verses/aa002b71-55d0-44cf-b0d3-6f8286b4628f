The bride says in the Book of Love, 'I have crossed all the mountains, aye,
even my own powers, and have reached the dark power of the Father. There
heard I without sound, there saw I without light, there breathed I without
motion; there did I taste what savoured not, there did I touch what touched
not back. Then my heart was bottomless, my soul loveless, my mind formless
and my nature natureless.â€™
