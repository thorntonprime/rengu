Description: July 24
---
Those who sense eternity are beyond all fear. They see in every night the
place where day begins, and are consoled.

Fearlessness is necessary for summer to come. Spring can be troubled; to
its blossoming, uneasiness is like a home. But fruit needs the strength and
calm of the sun. All must be ready to receive, with wide open gateways and
substantial bridges.

A race that is born in fear comes as a stranger to the world and never finds
its way home.
