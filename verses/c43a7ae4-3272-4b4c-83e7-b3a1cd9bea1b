When you relax your attention [prosoché] for a little while,
do not imagine that whenever you choose you will recover,
but bear this in mind, that because of the mistake which you have made to-day,
your condition must be necessarily worse as regards everything else.
For, to begin with – and this is the worst of all –
a habit of not paying attention is developed;
and after that a habit of deferring attention [prosoché];
and always you grow accustomed to putting off from one time to another
tranquil and appropriate living,
the life in accordance with nature, and persistence in that life.
Now if the postponement of such matters is profitable,
it is still more profitable to abandon them altogether;
but if it is not profitable,
why do you not maintain your attention [prosoché] continuously?
