By: St Ignatius Loyola

Take, O Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding
and my whole will. Thou hast given me all that I am and all that I
possess. I surrender it all to Thee that Thou mayest dispose of it
according to Thy will. Give me but Thy love and Thy grace; these are
sufficient for me, and I will have no more to desire.
