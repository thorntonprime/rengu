Even the next era has no right to judge anything if it lacks the ability to
contemplate the past without hatred or envy. But even that judgment would

and carries much of the past within it. It is fortunate if something of the
ancestors lives on in it and continues to be loved and protected; only then
does the past become fruitful and effective.
