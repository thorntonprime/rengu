At the time that Xuefeng was dwelling at a hermitage, there was a pair
of monks who came to pay the customary respects. Feng saw them come
and used a hand to support himself on the hermitage door. Letting go,
he personally came forward and said, "Is what?"

The monks likewise said, "Is what?"

Feng hung his head and returned to the hermitage.

The monks later went to Yantou. Tou asked, "From what place have you
come?"

The monks said, "We've come from south of the mountain range (alt. the
southern mountain range)."

Tou said, "You monks went to Xuefeng?"

The monks said, "We monks went."

Tou said, "What did you have for words and phrases?

The monks raised the preceding discussion.

Tou said, "What did he say?"

The monks said, "He was speechless. He hung his head and returned to
the hermitage."

Tou said, "Too bad. I regard this as my doing in the first place. I
regret not saying to him the final after phrase. If I had said it to
him, how the people under heaven could not deal with Old Xue."

When the end of summer arrived, the monks repeated the words they had
raised before and begged for augmentation.

Tou said, "Why didn't you ask beforehand?"

The monks said, "We had not the confidence to permit it easily."

Tou said, "Even though Xuefeng and I are born in the same line, he and
I do not die in the same line. One should know the final phrase
afterwards, only this is."
