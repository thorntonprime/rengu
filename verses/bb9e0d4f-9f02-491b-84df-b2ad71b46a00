The object and existence of the mind are essential and not contingent.
The mind has a pure, unadulterated being of its own.
When it comes across truth or essence,
at once it is attracted and settles down to utter its oracle --
  for now it has a point of reference.
It the intellect does not discover any essential truth or touch some bedrock,
so that it can say "this is this and therefore not something else,"
if it has to continue searching and expecing,
arrested or attracted by nothing, it can only work on until the end,
when it passes out, still searching and still expecting.
