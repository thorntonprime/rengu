Title: Slander
---
There’s a lot of slander and envy in this world.
If there is any toward you, don’t listen.
Those who pleasure in slander are glad that the sun has its spots.
They might slander you for having nothing to slander.

One can call a dozing lion a dead lamb,
but they can’t call you coward for falling among thieves
 in the wilderness.
One can call lewd the goose sleeping with the seagull on the sand,
but they can’t call you loose for being tricked into the brothel.
If there is slander and envy toward you, don’t listen.
