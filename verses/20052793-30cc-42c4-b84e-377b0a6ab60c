It is God that has brought you to me, Asclepius, to hear a teaching which
comes from God. My discourse will be of such a nature, that by reason of its
pious fervour it will be rightly deemed that there is in it more of God’s
working than in all that I have spoken before -- or rather, that God’s
power has inspired me to speak.
