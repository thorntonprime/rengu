---
At last thou hast departed and gone to the Unseen;
Tis marvellous by what way thou wentest from the world.
Thou didst strongly shake thy wings and feathers, and having broken thy
 cage
Didst take to the air and journey towards the world of soul.
Thou wert a favourite falcon, kept in captivity by an old woman：
When thou heard'st the falcon-drum thou didst fly away into the Void.
Thou wert a love-lorn nightingale among owls：
The scent of the rose-garden reached thee, and thou didst go to the rose-
 garden.
Thou didst suffer sore head-ache from this bitter ferment;
At last thou wentest to the tavern of Eternity.
Straight as an arrow thou didst make for the mark of bliss;
Thou didst speed like an arrow to that mark from this bow.
