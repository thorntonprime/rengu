Assuredly, the nature of the ether within the space of the heart is the same
as the supreme bright power. This has been manifested in threefold wiseï¼š
in fire, in the sun, and in the breath of life.

Verily, the nature of the ether within the space of the heart is the same
as the syllable Om.

With this syllable, indeed, that bright power is raised up from the depths,
goes upwards, and is breathed forth. Verily, therein is a perpetual support
for meditation upon Brahma.
