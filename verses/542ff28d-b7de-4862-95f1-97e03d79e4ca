It struck me at that moment that I was beginning to understand an inner truth
that I had been trying to articulate with difficulty for so many months. As a
boy at St. Wilfred’s I had once listened during Easter week to a Franciscan
retreat leader, talking of the strict vocation to the contemplative life in
the silence and austerity ofa Carthusian monastery. Afterwards I had walked
in these same gardens thinking how heroic, how unattainable an ideal that
was. How I longed for the courage to love God that much! And now, thirty
years or so later, I was only just beginning to understand that the desert
wilderness of spirituality is not to be found exclusively in those convents
and houses of prayer where men and women dedicate themselves, externally,
to the service of God. The desert may lie at the very heart of a person’s
life, in the depths of one’s being.

Many people who have turned away from religion -- even with a sense of
hatred, rejecting all its idiosyncratic externals -- to embrace scepticism,
agnosticism, even militant atheism, are perhaps as much in the desert, in
the udark night ofthe soul,” as any contemplative. What we are fleeing,
perhaps, is not God at all, but the false or the inadequate representations
ofhim which hinder any possibility of ever making progress in coming to
recognize him or reach out for him. What we are rejecting, even hating,
is not God, but the “trash and tinsel” that passes for him.

And thus it is that “Hatred of God may bring the soul to God.”
