---
Virtue and wisdom are sublime things; but if they create pride and a
consciousness of separateness from the rest of humanity in the mind of
man, then they are only the snakes of self(ishness) reappearing in a
finer form. ... A man who becomes selfish isolates himself, grows less
interesting and less agreeable to others.
