Title: A Moment of Clarity
---
A flash of sanity： the momentary realization that there is no need to
come to certain conclusions about persons, events, conflicts, trends,
even trends toward evil and disaster, as if from day to day, and even from
moment to moment, I had to know and declare (at least to myself) that this
is so and so, this is good, this is bad.We are heading for a “new era"
or we are heading for destruction.What do such judgments mean? Little or
nothing. Things are as they are in an immense whole of which I am a part
and which I cannot pretend to grasp. To say I grasp it is immediately
to put myself in a false position, as if I were "outside" it. Whereas to
be “in” it is to seek truth in my own lite and action, moving where
movement is possible and keeping still when movement is unnecessary,
realizing that thing will continue to define themselves and that the
judgments, and mercies, of God will clarify themselves and will be more
clear to me if I am silent and attentive, obedient to His will, rather than
constantly formulating statements in this age which is smothered in language,
in meaningless and inconclusive debate in which, in the last analysis,
nobody listens to anything except what agrees with his own prejudices.
