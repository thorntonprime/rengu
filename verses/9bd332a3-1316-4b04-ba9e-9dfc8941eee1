Friends are weak in symbolizing power.
They do not feel the need of the "midway helps."
They are arrested and hindered by visible and tangible symbols.

They want to be left to deal directly and immediately
with the great realities by which they live.

There are times when they do not want words,
even though they may be very good words.

They want to feel the fresh, free currents of life
without any sound or voice.

They have a fear of stopping with the outward symbol
and of not getting beyond it to that deeper reality
for which it stands.

The result is that throughout their history,
they have preferred to seek for the baptism of the Spirit
without the use of water,
and to experience a communion of soul
with the living Christ
without the use of bread or wine.
