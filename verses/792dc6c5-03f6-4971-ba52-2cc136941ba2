If God alone is to be loved for Himself, then no creature is to be loved for
itself ; and so all self-love in every creature is absolutely condemned. And if
all created beings are only to be loved in and for God. then my neighbour is to
be loved as I love myself, and I am only to love myself as I love my neighbour
or any other created being, that is. only in and for God. And thus the command
of loving our neighbour as ourselves stands firm and yet all self-love is
plucked up by the roots.
