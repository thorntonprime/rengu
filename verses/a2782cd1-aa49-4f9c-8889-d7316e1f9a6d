Our union is like thisï¼š If you feel cold I would reach for a blanket
to cover our shivering feet.

If a hunger comes into your body I would run to my garden and start
digging potatoes.

If you asked for a few words of comfort and guidance I would quickly
kneel by your side and offer you a whole book ... as a gift.

If you ever ache with loneliness so much you weep, I would say,

Here is a rope, tie it around me, Hafiz will be your companion for
life.
