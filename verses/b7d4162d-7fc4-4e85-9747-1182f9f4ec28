Ch’ing, the chief carpenter, was carving wood into a stand for hanging
musical instruments. When finished, the work appeared to those who saw
it as though of supernatural execution. And the prince of Lu asked
him, saying, ‘What mystery is there in your art?’

‘No mystery, your Highness,’ replied Ch’ing; ‘and yet there is
something.

‘When I am about to make such a stand, I guard against any diminution
of my vital power. I first reduce my mind to absolute quiescence.
Three days in this condition, and I become oblivious of any reward to
be gained. Five days, and I become oblivious of any fame to be
acquired. Seven days, and I become unconscious of my four limbs and my
physical frame. Then, with no thought of the Court present to my mind,
my skill becomes concentrated, and all disturbing elements from
without are gone. I enter some mountain forest. I search for a
suitable tree. It contains the form required, which is afterwards
elaborated. I see the stand in my mind’s eye, and then set to work.
Otherwise, there is nothing. I bring my own natural capacity into
relation with that of the wood. What was suspected to be of
supernatural execution in my work was due solely to this.’
