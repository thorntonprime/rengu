Hui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu, "The king of Wei gave me some seeds of a
huge gourd. I planted them, and when they grew up, the fruit was big
enough to hold five piculs. I tried using it for a water container, but
it was so heavy I couldn't lift it. I split it in half to make dippers,
but they were so large and unwieldy that I couldn't dip them into any
thing. It's not that the gourds weren't fantastically big - but I
decided they were no use and so I smashed them to pieces."
