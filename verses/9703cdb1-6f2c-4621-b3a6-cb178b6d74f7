    Title: Love and Living
By: Thomas Merton
---
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves
alone -- we find it with another. We do not discover the secret of our
lives merely by study and calculation in our own isolated meditations. The
meaning of our life is a secret that has to be revealed to us in love,
by the one we love. And if this love is unreal, the secret will not be
found, the meaning will never reveal itself, the message will never be
decoded. At best, we will receive a scrambled and partial message, one
that will deceive and confuse us. We will never be fully real until we
let ourselves fall in love -- either with another human person or with God.
