Therefore a man who has wisdom enough to fill one office effectively,
good conduct enough to impress one community, virtue enough to please
one ruler, or talent enough to be called into service in one state, has
the same kind of self-pride as these little creatures. Sung Jung-tzu
would certainly burst out laughing at such a man. The whole world could
praise Sung Jung-tzu and it wouldn't make him exert himself; the whole
world could condemn him and it wouldn't make him mope.
