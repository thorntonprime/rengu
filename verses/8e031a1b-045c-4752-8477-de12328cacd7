One hole, emptiness pervading：
Crystal clear on all sides.
Formlessly, selflessly, spring enters the pipes：
Unstopped, unhindered, the moon traverses the sky.
Pure jewel eyes, arms of virtues：
All over the body -- how does it compare to throughout the body being it?
The present hands and eyes reveal the whole works：
The great function works in all ways -- what it taboo?
