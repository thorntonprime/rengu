From the Way came one,
from one came two,
from two, a few,
and then a sum,
until a myriad had come.
All these creatures,
with yin on their backs and yang in their breasts,
live by harmonizing their vital breaths.

A commoner is loathe to admit,
while leaders openly submit,
their humble roots or low repute.

One may gain by loss,
and lose by gain.

"Who lives by the sword, dies by the sword."
And "as you live, so shall you die."
What experience confirms,
I will wisely reaffirm.
