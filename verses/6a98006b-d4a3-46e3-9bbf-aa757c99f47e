God is the completion or the fullness of existence. Hence, the Name which
denotes Him, too, is full and perfect. Therefore, the power of the Name of
God is incalculable, for it is the height or the zenith of power. The Name
of God can achieve anything. There is nothing impossible for it. It is the
means to the realization of God Himself. Even as the name of a thing in this
world generates the consciousness of that thing in the mind, the Name of
God generates God-consciousness in the purified mind and becomes the direct
cause of the realization of the Highest Perfection.
