Title: "?"
---
Dim and drowsy, I heard your brisk steps,
Fighting heavy eyelids, I opened the window and looked：
wind-driven showers drive past the mountain ridge;
the sound of raindrops on the plantain leaves rises in waves.
At the moment emotion and reason collide,
the devil in humanity and the angel in beasts appear then vanish.
The young ape sleeps in the shaking clatter of your song.
It is awakened from its pitiful dream by the sound of fallinig flowers.
The jeweled flickers of the lonely lamp that guards the dead night
 quietly falls under its own weight.
Pitiable souls, burning in insane flames,
search out a new world in the hopeless freeze of despair.

It's the flower of the desert,
it’s the full moon of the moonless night,
it’s your face.
My jade-white lips can’t touch yours, awash in a faint smile.
The window weighted by the moon’s still light
 frames the bobbing shadow of a cat smoothinig its coat.
Is it the Buddha or the devil? Is life but dust or a dream of gold?
Oh, little bird, sleeping on the frail branch that sways in the wind.
