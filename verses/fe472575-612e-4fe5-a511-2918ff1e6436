All the properties of the inner and holy body, including the outward qualities,
were perfectly harmonized (in the first man)ï¼š none lived in a self-desire
but all reabsorbed their desire into the soul wherein the divine light was
manifested and which was like the sacred sky. The light shone across all the
properties and ruled equally over all the properties; all the properties
reabsorbed their desire into the light, a revealed sweetness of God which
interpenetrated all the properties. And through this interpenetration they
were all tinctured with a delicious love, in such way that they had in
themselves only this savour and desire of love.
