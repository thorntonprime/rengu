Finite human beings shall never know in its fullness Truth and Love which is
in iteself infinite. But we do know enough for our guidance. We shall err,
and sometimes greivously, in our application. But man is a self-governing
being, and self-government necessarily includes the power as much to commit
errors as to set them right as often as they are made.
