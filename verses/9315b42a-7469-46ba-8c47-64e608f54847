Title: An Ever-Ancient New Creation
---
The power of the Easter Vigil liturgy in part stems from the fact that
so many vestiges of primitive nature rites are included and sanctified
in it. Mystery of fire and mystery of water. Mystery of spring： Ver
sacrum. Fire, water and spring made sacred and meaningful theologically by
the Resurrection of Christ, the new creation. Instead of stamping down the
force of new life in us (and turning it into a dragon), let it be sweetened,
sanctified and exalted, a figure of the life of the Spirit which is made
present in our heart’s love by the Resurrection.

One unquestionable improvement in the liturgy of Holy Week is the recovery
of the more ancient tone for the singing of the Passion. It is splendidly
austere and noble.Tremendously moving, like great tolling Flemish bells
stirring whole populations in medieval cities, or like the stone sides
of the Cistercian churches of the twelfth century which echoed to those
tones.The chant was a mighty and living presence, binding us together in
mystery.A great eloquence and sobriety that has almost been lost from
the world but has been recoveredThis eloquence, though, is stubborn,
it is in man, it will not go. Christ preserves it, as He preserves us,
from our own vulgarity.
