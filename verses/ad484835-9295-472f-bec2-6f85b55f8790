I affirm that the temporal power does not receive its being from the spiritual,
nor its virtue, which is its authority; nor even its efficiency absolutely. But
it does receive therefrom the power of operating with greater virtue, through
the light of grace which the blessing of the supreme pontiff infuses into it,
in heaven and on earth.
