Such are all great historical men -- whose own particular aims involve
those large issues which are the will of the world-spirit. They may be
called heroes. ...

Such individuals had no consciousness of the general Idea they were
unfolding, while prosecuting those aims of theirs; on the contrary, they
were practical, political men. But at the same time they were thinking men,
who had an insight into the requirements of the time -- what was ripe for
development. This was the very truth for their age, for their world; the
species next in order, so to speak, and which was already formed in the
womb of time. It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessity,
directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make
this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it.
