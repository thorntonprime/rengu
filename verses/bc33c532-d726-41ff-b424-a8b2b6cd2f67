Title: The Secret of Death
---
The great secret of death, and perhaps its deeper connection with us,
is thisï¼š that, in taking from us a being we have loved and venerated,
death does not wound us without, at the same time, lifting us toward a
more perfect understanding of this being and of ourselves.
