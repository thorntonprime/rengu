when peach blossoms open in the court
oh, happy, joyous drunk
when lotus blooms perfume the pool
oh mornings, evenings, drunk
when golden asters cluster by the hedgerow path
oh falling, tumbling, drunk
and when the wax-plum on the mountainside
first blooms to herald the spring
oh coming,going, drunk
getting drunker, getting drunker
drunk and sober; sober, drunk
