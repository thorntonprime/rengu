Gaze at the sky, the earth, the sea, and all the things which shine in them or
above them, or creep or fly or swim beneath them. They have forms because they
have rhythm; take this away, and they will no longer be. From whom then are
they, save from Him. from whom rhythm is; since they have being only in so far
as they are rhythmically ordered. ...  Pass, therefore, beyond the mind of the
artist, so that thou mayest see the everlasting rhythm; then will wisdom shine
upon thee from her inmost abode, from the very sanctuary of truth.
