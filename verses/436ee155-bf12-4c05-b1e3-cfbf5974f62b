The region of Ching-shih in Sung is fine for growing catalpas,
cypresses, and mulberries. But those that are more than one or two
arm-lengths around are cut down for people who want monkey perches;
those that are three or four spans around are cut down for the
ridgepoles of tall roofs;", and those that are seven or eight spans are
cut down for the families of nobles or rich merchants who want side
boards for coffins. So they never get to live out the years Heaven gave
them, but are cut down in mid-journey by axes. This is the danger of
being usable. In the Chieh sacrifice," oxen with white foreheads, pigs
with turned-up snouts, and men with piles cannot be offered to the
river. This is something all the shamans know, and hence they consider
them inauspicious creatures. But the Holy Man for the same reason
considers them highly auspicious.
