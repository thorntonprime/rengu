A beauty that all night long teaches love-tricks to Venus and the moon.
Whose two eyes by their witchery seal up the two eyes of heaven.
Look to your hearts! I whate'er betide, O Moslems.
Am so mingled with him that no heart is mingled with me.
I was born of his love at the first. I gave him my heart at the last;
When the fruit springs from the bough, on that bough it hangs..
The tip of his curl ns saying,'Ho! betake thee to rope dancing.'
The cheek of his candle is saying,'Where is a moth that it may burn?'
For the sake of dancing on that rape, O heart, make haste, become a hoop;
Cast thyself on the flame, when his candle is lit.
Thou wilt never more endure without the flame, when thou hast known the
 rapture of burning;
If the water of life should come to thee, it would not stir thee from the
 flame.
