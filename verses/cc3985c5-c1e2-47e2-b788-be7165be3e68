Most of the difficulties arise in your daily life if you do not have proper
control over your mind. For instance, if a man does evil to you, instantly
you want revenge, to extract tooth for tooth, tit for tat policy; to return
anger for anger. Every reaction of evil shows that the mind is not under
control. By anger one loses his energy.
