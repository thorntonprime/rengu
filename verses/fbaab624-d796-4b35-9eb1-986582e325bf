Commentary: |
  One sees how it is the tendency today, in the absence of any principle, for
  the ‘students' (those at an age which is naturally rebellious, when passion
  and illusion most easily dominate the mind) of various countries to assume
  ‘responsibility’ for their governments, by way of anarchy and violence.

The human race when best disposed depends upon a unity in wills. But this
unity cannot be unless there is one will dominating and ruling all the rest to
oneness; inasmuch as the wills of mortals, because of the seductive delights
of youth, have need of a directive principle, as the philosopher teaches in
the last Ad Nicomachum. Nor can that one will exist unless there be a single
prince of all, whose will may be the mistress and ruler of all others. Now if
all the above deductions are sound, which they are, it is necessary for the
best disposition of the human race that there should be a monarch in the world,
and therefore for the well-being of the world that there should be a monarchy.
