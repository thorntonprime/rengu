A test is raised for examination/(to) examine it：

Raised：

Venerable Tianping (Heavenly-peace) at the time of
traveling on foot called on Xiyuan (Western-courtyard). [He] always
said, "Do not say [you] understand Buddha Dharma. [I] seek a single
person to raise a saying, and still there is none."

One day Xiyuan, seeing [him] in the distance, called and
said, "Zongyi" (Tianping's personal name).

Ping raised his head

Xiyuan said, "Wrong." (mistake, blunder, fault)

Ping walked three pairs of steps.

Xiyuan again said, "Wrong."

Ping neared in front.

Xiyuan said, "It is fitting to come to this pair of
wrongs, but are they Xiyuan's (i.e., my) wrongs or are they
Upper-seat's (i.e., your) wrongs?"

Ping said, "Zongyi's (i.e., my) wrongs."

Xiyuan said, "Wrong."

Ping gave up to go.

Xiyuan said, "Just for the time being Upper-seat, pass
the summer on this other side and [we can] stay together to discuss and
deliberate this pair of wrongs."

Ping undertook at that time then to walk [on].

Afterwards in residence [as abbot] at a Courtyard (i.e.,
a temple) [he] spoke to the multitude and said, "When I initially
undertook the time of traveling on foot, because of the working of the
wind, I arrived at senior elder Siming's place, and in succession [he]
let down a pair of 'wrongs.' Furthermore, [he wanted] to detain me to
pass the summer to stay together with me to discuss and deliberate
[them]. At the time I did not say in that way, 'Wrong.' At the time I
started on foot toward the direction of the South, I knew beforehand to
say 'Wrong' entirely (alt. in the end)!"
