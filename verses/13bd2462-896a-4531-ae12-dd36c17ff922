The mystery of our Art, which we conceal with so great care, is the
preparation of the Mercury, which above ground is not to be found made
ready to our hand.  But when it is prepared, it is ‘our water’ in
which gold is dissolved, whereby the latent life of the gold is set
free, and receives the life of the dissolving Mercury, which is to
gold what good earth is to the grain of wheat. When the gold has
putrefied in the Mercury, there arises out of the decomposition of
death a new body, of the same essence, but of a glorified substance.
Here you have the whole of our Philosophy in a nutshell. There is no
secret about it. except the preparation of Mercury, its mingling with
the gold in the right proportions, and the regulation of the fire in
accordance with its requirements. Gold by itself does not fear the
fire： hence the great point is, to temper the heat to the capacity of
the Mercury.
