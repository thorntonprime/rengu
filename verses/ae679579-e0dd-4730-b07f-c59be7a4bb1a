Title: No Need to Ask
---
The one who brings wine pours again,
no need to ask.

Do you ask the moon to rise
and give its light?

When ranks of soldiers dissolve,
dismissed for a holiday,

when a lost hand reaches
to touch the rescuing hand,

when a candle next to a mirrored
sconce gets lit,

your presence enters my soul.
