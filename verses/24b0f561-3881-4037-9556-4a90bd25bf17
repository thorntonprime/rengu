Title: Grateful for Another Miracle
---
Shall I reread the bits in St.]ohn of the Cross’s The Ascent ofMount Carmel
about the memory? They seem to do me so much good -- always. Year after
year, returning to them. In what sense do they make a difference in my life?

This Journal -- the one I am writing right now. Apparently I have not yet
written enough of it to become completely solitary and to be able to do
without it. It is useless to drop the thing and say I am solitary just
because I am not writing a Journal, when, in fact, the writing could help
me find my way to where I am supposed to be traveling.

So I read about “forgetting” and write down all I remember. And
somehow there is no contradiction here. It is simply a somewhat peculiar
way of becoming a saint. I by no means insist that it is sanctity. All I
say is that I must do what the situation seems to demand, and sanctity
will appear when out of all this Christ, in His own good time, appears
and manifests His own glory.

Tenderness of the Epistle, austerity of the Gospel in this morning’s
Mass, the Vigil of Passion Sunday. Last night, before Compline, out by
the horse barn, looking at the orchard and thinking about what St. John of
the Cross said about having in your heart the image of Christ： crucified.

Confusion and fog pile up in your life, and then, by the power of the Cross,
things once again are clear, and you know more about your wretchedness
and you are grateful for another miracle.
