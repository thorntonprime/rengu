Attain complete emptiness, Hold fast to stillness.
The ten thousand things stir about; I only watch for their going back.
 Things grow and grow, But each goes back to its root.
Going back to the root is stillness. This means returning to what is.
 Returning to what is Means going back to the ordinary.
Understanding the ordinary： Enlightenment. Not understanding the ordinary：
 Blindness creates evil. Understanding the ordinary： Mind opens. Mind
 opening leads to compassion, Compassion to nobility, Nobility to
 heavenliness, Heavenliness to Tao.
Tao endures. Your body dies. There is no danger.
