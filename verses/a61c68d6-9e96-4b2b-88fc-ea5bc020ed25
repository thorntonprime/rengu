God is a very hard taskmaster. He is never satisfied with fireworks
display. His mills although they grind surely and incessantly grind
excruciatingly slow and He is never satisfied with hasty forfeitures of
life. It is a sacrifice of the purest that He demands, and so you and I
have prayerfully to plod on, live out the life so long as it is vouchsafed
to us to live it.
