Title: One Spirit Praying in All
---
Contemplative prayer is the recognition that we are the Sons of God, an
experience ofWho God is, and ofHis love for us, flowing from the operation
of that love in us. Contemplative prayer is the voice of the Spirit crying
out in us,“Abba, Pater" In all prayer it is the Holy Spirit who prays
in us, but in the graces of contemplation He makes us realize, at least
obscurely, that it is He who is praying in us with a love too deep and
too secret for us to comprehend. We exult in the union of our voice with
His voice, and our soul springs up to the Father, through the Son, having
become one flame with the Flame of their Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the
soul of the Church, and it is to His presence in us that is attributed
the sanctity of each one of the elect. He prays in us now as the Soul of
the Church and now as the life of our own soul -- but the distinction is
real only in the external order of things, lnteriorly, whether our prayer
is private or public, it is the same Spirit praying in us： He is really
touching different strings of the same instrument.
