God is present to himself in every Creature, after the manner of a
God.

Where-ever he is present. He is entirely present with all the Joys and
Glories of eternity, ever undivided. His own Heaven to himself, in the
Depths of Hell beneath as in the Heights of Heaven above, in the dust
of the Grave, in a wave of the Sea. as in the most shining Cherubim or
flaming Seraphim.
