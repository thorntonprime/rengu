Title: Prayer to Awaken Bodhicitta
---
Ho! Mesmerized by the sheer variety of appearances, which are like the
illusory reflections of the moon and water, beings wander endlessly astray
in samsaraâ€™s vicious cycle.

In order that they may find comfort and ease, and the luminosity
and all-pervading space of the true nature of their minds, I generate
immeasurable love, compassion, joy, and equanimity of the awakened mind,
the heart of bodhicitta.

Sentient beings are numberless, I train in order to free them.

Delusions are inexhaustible, I train in order to transform them.

Reality is boundless, I train in order to realize it.

The awakened way is unsurpassable, I train in order to embody it.
