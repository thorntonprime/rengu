Not until we have reduced ourselves to nothingness can we conquer the evil
in us, God demands nothing less than complete self-surrender as the price
for the only real freedom that is worth having, And when a man thus loses
himself he immediately finds himself in the service of all that lives,
It becomes his delight and his recreation, He is a new man, never weary
of spending himself in the service of God's creation.
