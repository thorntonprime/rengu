Most people only perceive change. To them things come in and out of
existence. Sooner or later, what’s new becomes old, what’s valuable becomes
worthless. Their egos determine the nature of destiny of everything

When existence is defined in such finite, ephemeral terms, the power to
control people and things is naturally seen as an exercise of ego. And why
not? Isn’t the ego an authority on the subject of change? Of course, when
it comes to the One Thing That Never Changes, the ego is amazingly
ignorant. Nowadays people don’t appreciate the Changeless. They scramble to
keep up with every fad and fashion. They’re like comedians, desperately
trying to acquire new jokes. Their lives depend on keeping the audience
laughing.

What’s truly funny is their conviction that they’re free, powerful and in
control. In reality they’re merely helpless slaves to an illusion.
