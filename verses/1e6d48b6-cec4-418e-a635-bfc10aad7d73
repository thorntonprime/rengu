Title: Constrained In Will
---
But to attain loftiness without constraining the will; to achieve moral
training without benevolence and righteousness, good order without
accomplishments and fame, leisure without rivers and seas, long life
without Induction; to lose everything and yet possess everything, at
ease in the illimitable, where all good things come to attend - this is
the Way of Heaven and earth, the Virtue of the sage. So it is said,
Limpidity, silence, emptiness, inaction - these are the level of Heaven
and earth, the substance of the Way and its Virtue. So it is said, The
sage rests; with rest comes peaceful ease, with peaceful ease comes
limpidity, and where there is ease and limpidity, care and worry cannot
get at him, noxious airs cannot assault him. Therefore his Virtue is
complete and his spirit unimpaired.
