These are a few of the ways we can practice humility： Speak as little as
possible of oneself. Mind one’s own business. Avoid curiosity. Do not want
to manage other people’s affairs. Accept contradiction and correction
cheerfully. Pass over the mistakes of others. Accept blame when innocent.
Yield to the will of others. Accept insults and injuries. Accept being
slighted, forgotten and disliked. Be kind and gentle even under
provocation. Do not seek to be specially loved and admired. Never stand on
one’s dignity. Yield in discussion even though one is right. Choose always
the hardest.
