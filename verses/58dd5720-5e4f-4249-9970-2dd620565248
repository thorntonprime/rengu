Would that it were possible for you to grow wings, and soar into the air!
Poised between earth and heaven, you might see the solid earth, the fluid sea
and the streaming rivers, the wandering air, the penetrating fire, the courses
of the stars, and the swiftness of the movement with which heaven encompasses
all. What happiness were that, my son, to see all these borne along with one
impulse, and to behold Him who is unmoved moving in all Beauty that moves, and
Him who is hidden made manifest through his works!
