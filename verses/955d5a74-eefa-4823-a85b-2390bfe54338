By: John Smith the Platonist
---
Superstition ... disrobes the Deity of true majesty and perfection,
and represents it as weak and infirm, clothed with such fond, feeble,
and impotent passions, as men themselves are. ... If the superstitious
man thinks that God is altogether like himself, which indeed is a
character most proper to such, the atheist will soon say in his heart,
‘there is no God;’ and will judge it, not without some appearance of
reason, to be better there were none.
