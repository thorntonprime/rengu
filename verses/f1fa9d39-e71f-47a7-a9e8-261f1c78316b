Among all beings -- animals and non-animals -- Hermes maintained that two
sexes are found; and he argued, in consequence, that the Cause of All, God,
comprised in Himself the masculine and feminine sexes, of which he believed
Venus and Cupid were a manifestation. Valerius Romanus also shared this view
and sang of an omnipotent Jupiter who was God the father and God the mother.
