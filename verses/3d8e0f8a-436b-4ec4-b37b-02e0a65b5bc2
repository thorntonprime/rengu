When I looked for good, then evil came unto me： and when I waited for
light, there came darkness.

My bowels boiled, and rested not： the days of affliction prevented
me.

I went mourning without the sun： I stood up. and I cried in the

congregation.

I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

My skin is black upon me. and my bones are burned with heat.

My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of
them that weep.
