Title: On Being a Stranger
---
On being a stranger, I need more awareness of what it involves, And get
some such awareness by the invitations I have to refuse.

Being “out of the world” does not mean simply being out of Las
Vegas -- it means being not on planes, not at the reunions, conferences,
etc, Not in Hong Kong today and Lima tomorrow, not in the credit card,
expense account, talk circuit where you are paid to be everywhere, and
this to make news (because where you are paid to be, there the action is,
since the action is that you are paid to be there).

The question is： do I really care? Do I resent being excluded from all
this? Inevitably my being grounded in this corner of the woods, unable to
move, able only to speak half-surreptitiously to a few who get through to
me here, makes me a comic sort of intellectual, Inevitably I am a sort of
reform-school kid who is punished by being taken off the street, And one
who does not know the latest is not perfectly attuned to the intonations
and accents that convey the real message.

Certainly no point in mere resentment of modern society “bla bla.”

Nor trying to pretend I am, after all, superior.

Nevertheless, the situation has unique advantages, Much of the real
germinating action in the world, the real leavening, is among the
immobilized, the outsiders (the vast majority, who have no credit card
and never step on a plane), the Negroes, the Latinos, etc, In a way I am
on their level. (But I don’t have their grapevine!)
