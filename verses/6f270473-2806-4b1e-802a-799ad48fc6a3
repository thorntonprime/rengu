To know the science of music is nothing else than this, -- to know how all
things are ordered, and how God’s design has assigned to each its place; for
the ordered system in which each and all by the supreme Artist’s skill are
wrought together into a single whole yields a divinely musical harmony, sweet
and true beyond all melodious sounds.
