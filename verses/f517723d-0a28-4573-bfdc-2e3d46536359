He sees in the darkest dark, hears where there is no sound. In the
midst of darkness, he alone sees the dawn; in the midst of the
soundless, he alone hears harmony. Therefore, in depth piled upon depth
he can spy out the thing; in spirituality piled upon spirituality he
can discover the essences So in his dealings with the ten thousand
things he supplies all their wants out of total nothingness. Racing
with the hour, he seeks lodging for a night, in the great, the small,
the long, the short, the near, the far.
