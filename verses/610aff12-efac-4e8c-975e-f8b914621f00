Title: Liberation Day
---
Evening. A full moon rising over the sharply outlined valley. Everything
cool, green and very clear. I should have gone out for a long walk this
afternoon but I had to write letters and then I have acquired a tape recorder
and had to fool with it a little to make sure I know how to Work it. It is
a very fine machine and I am abashed by it. I take back some ofthe things
I have said about technology.

I have made this day a sort of perplexed celebration -- said Mass for M,
and her fiance and honestly hope they will get back in love again; in
fact, by now, they probably are. And that they will be happy in marriage
someday soon ... and so on. I am sure there is no real problem. At least,
I tell myself so. M, may want to hold on to me sentimentally in some way,
but I am convinced that the real love is more or less over between us,
though we shall always be fond of each other I am sure.

So in a way it is a liberation day -- and I have made up my mind to be
what I am supposed to be. (Finally!) Actually it is a most happy evening --
could not be more perfect. I have some bourbon (Tommie O'Callaghan brought
some) and am playing an ancient Django Reinhardt record that brings back
the thirties. (Regression?) Perhaps in a little while I shall go out and
stroll around under the trees. And try to tell myself that I am not really
sad at all.
