Title: Master's Sermon
---
I heard the Master’s sermon：
“Don’t be bound to the chains of love and suffer.
 Cut the ties and your mind will find joy.”

That Master is quite the fool.
To be bound with ties of love is painful, but to cut them
 is more painful than death.
In the tight bind of love’s ties lies its unbinding.
Thus great liberation lies in bondage.
My love, I feared that the ties that bind me to you might be weak,
 so I’ve doubled the strands of my love.
