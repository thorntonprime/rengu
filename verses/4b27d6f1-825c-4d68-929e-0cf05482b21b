  1946. p. 194： ’The world-process is the materialization of Vishnu's dream.'
Commentary: |
  The attitude expressed in the psalm above recalls the figure of Kali thrusting
  out her tongue with shame upon discovering that she has been dancing on the
  inert (sleeping) form of Shiva： or again. Vishnu in the quality of Rudra
  come to swallow up the universe.

As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt
despise their image.
