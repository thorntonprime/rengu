Commentary: "The attitude expressed in the psalm above recalls the\
  \ figure of Kali thrusting\nout her tongue with shame upon discovering\
  \ that she has been dancing on the\ninert (sleeping) form of Shiva\uFF1A\
  \ or again. Vishnu in the quality of Rudra\ncome to swallow up the\
  \ universe.\n"
