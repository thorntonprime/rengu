Thus let the philosopher observe, that when the three murtherers, viz. Saturn,
Mars, and Mercury, are drowned in the crimson-coloured blood of the lion, they
do not perish; but they are pardoned, that is, their wrath is changed into a
love-desire, viz, out of Venus into Sol; for when the fiery desire enters into
the watery desire, then a shining, viz, a glorious splendour, arises from and
in the fire; for Venus is white, and the fire-desire is red.
