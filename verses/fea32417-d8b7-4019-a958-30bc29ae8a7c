It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that
 detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.
The gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right
 when he goes to war.
Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.
When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.
There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult
 in the killing of men.
One who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.
On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;
On occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.
A lieutenants place is on the left;
The general's place is on the right.
This means that it is mourning rites that are observed.
When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with
 sorrow.
When victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.
