A vagabond mind running hither and thither among the varying and false
delights of the world is tired out, not satisfied, by its vain exertion;
while, starved, it counts as little whatever it gormandizes upon compared
with what remains to be devoured, and ever it craves the things removed from
it not less anxiously than it joyfully has and holds those that are at hand.
For who is there who can gain the whole world? And although a man can never
be certain when with anguish he may lose even the little which he has gained
with toil, he is certain, nevertheless, that some time or other he will lose
it.  Thus a perverted will strains eagerly after a direct short-cut to the
best and hurries on to that whereby it may be filled. Yea, in truth, by such
tortuous routes as these does vanity amuse itself, does iniquity deceive
itself. So if you would attain to the fulfilment of what you wish for, that
is, if you would lay hold upon that which, once grasped, leaves no more to be
desired -- what is the necessity of putting the rest to the test? You run along
bypaths and you will die long before you attain the object of your desires
along this circuitous route.
