Title: You Taste Us
---
It sounds as strange as it is true
to say, as I have never said before,

that You taste Yourself and in this
taste every creature that You ever

made which crawls or swims or flies,
on earth, in the seas, and upon the

blue-flung skies. And when You
taste Yourself in all these, and even

in me, You taste us all as You ever
are in the oneness of Yourself.
