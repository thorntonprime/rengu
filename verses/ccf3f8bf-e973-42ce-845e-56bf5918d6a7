Title: The Flowers Knew First
---
I left my old home and met spring another village.
Sometimes my dreams follow the spring breeze and reach a distant ruin.
My walking stick and my shadow chase each other,
  smeared with the green hue of grass.

On the path, I see flowers whose names I don’t know --
I’ll sit and perhaps forget my cares.
I thought the flower clusters were still wet with morning dew,
  but they knew first that my tears were falling.
