Title: Taoing
Commentary: |
 A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly
 impossible. It contains the book. I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges’s
 story： if you see it rightly, it contains everything
---
The way you can go
isn’t the real way.
The name you can say
isn’t the real name.

Heaven and earth
begin in the unnamed：
name’s the mother
of the ten thousand things.

So the unwanting soul
sees what’s hidden,
and the ever-wanting soul
sees only what it wants.

Two things, one origin,
but different in name,
whose identity is mystery.
Mystery of all mysteries!
The door to the hidden.
