Title: False Separation
---
Do you remember when we parted?
We can comfort ourselves and say it’s a false separation,
  but in fact our lips can’t touch.
When will this false separation be over?
One, maybe two years, I can’t say they don’t matter.
How many times will the fading peach in my cheeks
  be touched by the heartless spring wind and turn to fallen flowers?
How much will the graying blue-black clouds behind my ears
  be bleached by the autumn sun and turn to white snow?
The hair whitens, but the heart reddens.
The blood cools, but the tears burn.
Love’s hills are washed away, but in hope’s sea the waves dance.

I only know one day this false separation will end.
That day will take our separation with one hand
  and bring death with the other.
