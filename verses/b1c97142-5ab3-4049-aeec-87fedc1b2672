Let not thy requesting be a seeking for His giving, lest thy
understanding of Him should diminish; let thy requesting be for
manifesting thy servitude and establishing the rights of sovereignty.

How can thy subsequent seeking be a cause of His prior giving?

A predestined decree is exalted above being referred to causes.
