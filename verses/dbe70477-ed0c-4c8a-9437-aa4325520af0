Title: On the Verge of a Bad Deal
---
There is not a waking moment that you are not trying to savor what you
have, or get closer to what will bring you pleasure.

Being so preoccupied as we are with needing to be satisfied, it seems
we would be better at it by nowï¼š

that happiness would be our norm, not a rare event.

No heart can make love to its source and then can turn its back on the
Truth of your destiny ... which is someday -- you will never again
know pain,

moreover be the very fountainhead of all dance, laughter, eloquence.

Hafiz, why do you say all the things that you do? Well, angels, I
sometimes see you standing in the

market place on the verge of a bad deal. I see someone convincing your
wings to build a house

on earth, but your wings are not really meant for that. Thus how could
sorrow then not come?

With your money in hand, about to sign some contract, if a charming
minstrel came by, singing in a jovial mood,

you might turn in his direction and for another moment be spared the
world's cruel bindings.

There is not a word I have written that does not hope for your freedom
and contain the ingredients for it.
