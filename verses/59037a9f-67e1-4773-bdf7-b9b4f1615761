Title: Socialize a Bit
---
Shortly after my rooster crowed a favorite tune of his, a lizard appeared
 on a rock, close to where I was sitting, and practiced some new jokes.
Then a rabbit popped out of her hole and we discussed some essential matters,
 till an old dog, another pal of mine, came by.
Some birds that knew I was an easy mark gathered for their breakfast of
 seeds & crumbs.
The wind then whispered something in code, and I started clapping.
As lively as things can get around me -- and all the friends I have,
 truth isï¼š
I live in a dimension where there is only the Rose. Not a trace of me.
But I can step from that sublime state and socialize a bit.
