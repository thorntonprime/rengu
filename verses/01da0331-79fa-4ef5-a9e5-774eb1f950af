Title: A Late Night Snack
---
I know there are a lot of important things going on in the world that maybe I
 should in some way be attending.
But I was wondering how those pretty spiced apples, just out of the oven -- and
 in all of their aromatic glory
will taste for dessert, and then a late night snack.
