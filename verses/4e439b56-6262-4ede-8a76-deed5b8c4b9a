One of the deepest needs of the human soul is for a center, a focus which
confers meaning on the shapelessness of temporal existence. Perhaps the most
basic, after the awareness of family, is man’s apprehension of his immediate
locale. For the surrounding landscape represents something markedly other --
indeed the eternal presence of Otherness -- and as such it carries the
vibration of divinity. In man‘s identification with his region he realizes
what he is by intuiting everything he is not. Close at hand and yet aloofly
apart, it stands as the mandala of his unconscious associations, one of the
ineradicable patterns of psychic life. As such, the recourse to landscape
in the need for coherence has from time immemorial elevated man to his most
profound religious intuitions. Mountains, valleys, rivers, islands. Always
he has looked to the configuration of the world about him for the Face of God.
