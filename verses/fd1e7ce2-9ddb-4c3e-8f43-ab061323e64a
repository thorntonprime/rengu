Title: The Climate of My Corner of the Woods
---
There is a mental ecology, a living balance of spirits, in this corner of
the woods, There is a place for many other songs besides those of birds,
Of Vallejo, for instance, Or the dry, disconcerting voice of Nicanor
Parra, Or there is also ChuangTzu, whose climate is perhaps most the
climate of this hot corner of the woods, A climate in which there is no
need for explanations, There is also a Syrian hermit called Philoxenus,
There is the clanging prose of Tertullian, There is the deep vegetation of
that more ancient forest than mine： the deep forest in which the great
birds Isaias and Jeremias sing, When I am most sickened by the things
that are done by the country that surrounds this place, I will take out
the prophets and sing them in loud Latin across the hills and send their
fiery words sailing south over the mountains to the place where they split
atoms for bombs in Tennessee.

There is also the nonecology： the destructive unbalance of nature,
poisoned and unsettled by bombs, by fallout, by exploitation： the land
ruined, the waters contaminated, the soil charged with chemicals, ravaged
with machinery, the houses of farmers falling apart because everybody
goes to the city and stays there, There is no poverty as great as that of
the prosperous, no wretchedness as dismal as affluence, Wealth is poison,
There is no misery to compare with that which exists where technology has
been a total success, Full bellies have not brought peace and satisfaction
but dementia, and, in any case, not all the bellies are full, But the
dementia is the same for all.
