Raised：

The high official Lu and Nanquan were talking and
paused.

Lu said "Dharma Master Zhao says, 'Heaven, Earth, and I
are the same root. The 10,000 things and I are one body.' Ha, how
strange"

Nanquan pointed to a flower in front of the hall. He
called to the high official and said, "Nowadays people see this single
flower as if it looks like an appearance in a dream."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

Hearing, seeing, feeling, and knowing are not each separate.

Mountains and rivers cannot be observed in the middle of a mirror.

When the moon in the frosty heaven sets in the middle of the night,

Who shares the shining cold reflection in the clear and still deep
pool?
