The Lord of the River began to wag his head and roll his eyes. Peering
far off in the direction of Jo, he sighed and said, "The common saying
has it, `He has heard the Way a mere hundred times but he thinks he's
better than anyone else.' It applies to me. In the past, I heard men
belittling the learning of Confucius and making light of the
righteousness of Po Yi, though I never believed them. Now, however, I
have seen your unfathomable vastness. If I hadn't come to your gate, I
would have been in danger. I would forever have been laughed at by the
masters of the Great Method!"
