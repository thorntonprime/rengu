Title: That in this work a soul is cleansed both of his special sins and
  of the pain of them, and yet how there is no perfect rest in this life
---
More devices tell I thee not at this time; for an thou have grace to feel
the proof of these, I trow that thou shalt know better to learn me than I
thee. For although it should be thus, truly yet me think that I am full far
therefrom. And therefore I pray thee help me, and do thou for thee and for me.

Do on then, and travail fast awhile, I pray thee, and suffer meekly the pain if
thou mayest not soon win to these arts. For truly it is thy purgatory, and then
when thy pain is all passed and thy devices be given of God, and graciously
gotten in custom; then it is no doubt to me that thou art cleansed not only of
sin, but also of the pain of sin. I mean, of the pain of thy special foredone
sins, and not of the pain of the original sin. For that pain shall always
last on thee to thy death day, be thou never so busy. Nevertheless, it shall
but little provoke thee, in comparison of this pain of thy special sins;
and yet shalt thou not be without great travail. For out of this original
sin will all day spring new and fresh stirrings of sinï¼š the which thee
behoveth all day to smite down, and be busy to shear away with a sharp
doubleedged dreadful sword of discretion. And hereby mayest thou see and
learn, that there is no soothfast security, nor yet no true rest in this life.

Nevertheless, herefore shalt thou not go back, nor yet be overfeared of thy
failing. For an it so be that thou mayest have grace to destroy the pain
of thine foredone special deeds, in the manner before said -- or better
if thou better mayest -- sure be thou, that the pain of the original sin,
or else the new stirrings of sin that be to come, shall but right little be
able to provoke thee.
