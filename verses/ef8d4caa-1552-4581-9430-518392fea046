Title: Lonely Night
---
No moon in the sky, no breeze on the ground,
no sound of people -- and I, empty of mind.

Is the universe death?
Is life sleep?

The golden thread of love’s memory attaches to my brow at one end;
to a little star at the other; and gently, gently disappears.
One hand grasps a golden sword, the other plucks celestial flowers,
and the queen of illusion also vanishes.
Who knew that love's golden thread and illusion’s queen
would clasp hands, and, in tears, die for each other?

Is the universe death?
Is life tears?

If life is tears,
is death love?
