I don't care for the Christian concept of an afterlife. I distance myself
from it ever more, without of course taking the trouble to attack it. It
may have its value, alongside so many other metaphysical hypotheses. But
for me the danger is that it not only renders what is mortal more vague and
inaccessible, but also -- because of our longing for the Beyond -- it makes us
less present and earthy. As long as we are here, and cousin to tree, flower,
soil, may all that is near at hand be real to us and enter fully our awareness.
