Title: What Is Love? Gratitude
---
Don't unstring your bow.
I am your four-feathered arrow
that has not been used yet.

I am a strong knifeblade word,
not some if or maybe, dissolving in air.
I am sunlight slicing the dark.

Who made this night?
A forge deep in the earth-mud.

What is the body?
Endurance.

What is love?
Gratitude.

What is hidden in our chests?
Laughter.

What else?
Compassion.

Don't ask what love can make or do.
Look at the colors of the world.
The riverwater moving in all rivers at once.
