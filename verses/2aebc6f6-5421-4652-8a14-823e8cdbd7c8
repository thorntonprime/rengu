Title: Who Could Read All This?
Description: August 10
---
To God, there is never a question of giving or not giving ... Her mercy.
And yes, let’s call God a Her sometimes to balance out all that male
 testosterone that took over the world’s holy books;
they look gender-biased to me. I think we should sue someone right now ...
 before it gets too late and some statute of limitations expires.
God’s mercy is a natural reflex; moreover it is just there. It is like
 the water in a lake-a fish should never ask permission to drink or be alive in.
As much thought as a fish would give to any needed divine sanction to move
 his fins or piddle in the Ocean, so is there a proportionate suffering meant
 to correct any screwed up notions you harbor about Truth.
I don’t want to explain this; if your teacher really knows anything, she can.
Mercy and Grace are just there; they are attributes of light, they want
 nothing but to be.
God wants nothing in return for your existence. What madness to ever think
 you owe Him/Her/It anything.
Gosh, who could read all of this? But maybe it is a perspicuous move.
