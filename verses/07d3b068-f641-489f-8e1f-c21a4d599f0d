When he (who beholds the wonders of God) loses beard and moustache (abandons
pride and egoism) from (contemplating) His work, he will know his (proper)
station and will be silent concerning the Worker (Maker).

He will only say from his soul. ‘I cannot (praise Thee duly).’ because
the declaration thereof is beyond reckoning and bound.
