I once met, face to face,
a scholar, a truly brilliant man,
perfect in his erudition, sparkling, shocking,
a mind beyond compare.
Chosen by examination, his name was bruited on high,
even his quatrains were better than all other men's.
Once in office his decisions were beyond
the finest cases of all the Ancient Sages.
He would travel in no other's dust.
Then of sudden his heart, his nature, flagged and burned.
Wealth and honor? Cowries are cunts, and money too ...
Strung together they can be read, "nobility."
When roof tiles are shattered, and ice melts away ...
What is there? What is there left to say.
