If an ordinary man, when he is about to die, could only see the five elements
of consciousness as void; the four physical elements as not constituting an
‘I’; the real Mind as formless and neither coming nor going; his nature as
something neither commencing at his birth nor perishing at his death, but as
whole and motionless in its very depths; his Mind and environmental objects
as one -- if he could really accomplish this, he would receive Enlightenment
in a flash. He would no longer be entangled by the Triple World; he would
be a World-Transcendor. He would be without even the faintest tendency
towards rebirth. If he should behold the glorious sight of all the Buddhas
coming to welcome him, surrounded by every kind of gorgeous manifestation,
he would feel no desire to approach them. If he should behold all sorts of
horrific forms surrounding him, he would experience no terror. He would just
be himself, oblivious of conceptual thought and one with the Absolute. He
would have attained the state of unconditioned being. This, then, is the
fundamental principle.
