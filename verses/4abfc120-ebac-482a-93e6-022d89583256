Through the cooling influence of bhakti, one sees forms of God in the Ocean of
the Absolute. These forms are meant for the bhaktas, the lovers of God. But
when the Sun of Knowledge rises, the ice melts; it becomes the same water it
was before. Water above and water below, everywhere nothing but water.
