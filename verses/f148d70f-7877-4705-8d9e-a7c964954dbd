The Yellow Emperor went wandering north of the Red Water, ascended the
slopes of K'un-lun, and gazed south. When he got home, he discovered he
had lost his Dark Pearl. He sent Knowledge to look for it, but
Knowledge couldn't find it. He sent the keen-eyed Li Chu to look for
it, but Li Chu couldn't find it. He sent Wrangling Debate to look for
it, but Wrangling Debate couldn't find it. At last he tried employing
Shapeless, and Shapeless found it.
