Title: Now Is the Time
---
Now is the time to know that all you do is sacred.

Now, why not consider a lasting truce with yourself and God?

Now is the time to understand that all your ideas of right and wrong
were just

a child's training wheels, to be laid aside when you could finally
live with veracity and courage.

Hafiz is a divine envoy whom the Beloved has written a holy message
upon.

My dear, please tell me, why do you still throw sticks at your heart
and Him?

What is it in that sweet voice inside that incites you to fear?

Now is the time for the world to know that every thought and action is
sacred.

This is the time for you to deeply compute the impossibility that
there is anything but Grace.

Now is the season to know that everything we do ... is sacred.
