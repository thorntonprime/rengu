Title: Hymn of Praise
---
You are gold tempered a hundred times over.
Bask in the love of heaven until the mulberry roots turn to coral.
Nim, my beloved, you are the first ray of morning light.

You know the weight of righteousness and the lightness of gold.
Sow the seeds of fortune in beggarsâ€™ poor soil.
Nim, my beloved, you are the whisper of the old Paulownia.

You favor spring, light, and peace.
Become the bodhisattva that sprinkles tears on the heart of the weak
Nim, my beloved, you are the spring wind upon a sea of ice.
