For I tell thee by that Truth, which is God Himself, if thou art ever to
become a man after the will of God, every thing must die in thee to which
thou art cleaving, whether it be God’s gifts, or the saints, or the angels,
or even all that would afford thee consolation for thy spiritual wants： all
must be given up. If God is to shine in on thy soul brightly, without a
cloud, and accomplish His noble and glorious will in thee, thou must be free
and unencumbered by all that affords thee comfort out of God.
