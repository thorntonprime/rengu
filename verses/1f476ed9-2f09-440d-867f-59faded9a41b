People make the mistake of identifying themselves with their body, then if
something happens to a person’s body, they think something has happened to
the person. When you think about it, that’s as ridiculous as saying that
if something happens to the clothing I’m wearing, something has happened to
me. Our body is just what we wear. ... We need to take care of it, butit’s
not who we are.
