Some folks point to the sharp-tanged spring-tree
and claim it's the fragrant, sacred sandalwood ...
As grains of sand are the multitudes
who've sought the way like this.
They've tried to lead the Way so too.
How many, though, of any of these
have ever reached nirvana?
They throw out the gold and haul away the straw.
But fooling other folks, they've fooled themselves.
On a pathway made of sand,
it's hard to make a mud ball.
