Title: Yunmen's One Treasure
---
Yunmen taught the assembly saying,

"'Inside of Heaven and Earth,

In the interstices of the universe,

Within there exists one treasure

Hidden in Form Mountain.'

Pick up the lantern and face towards the inner Buddha
Hall, the triple gate will come on the top of the lantern."

Look, look,

On the ancient shore, what person holds the fishing pole?

Clouds gradually, gradually.

Waters endlessly, endlessly.

The reed flowers in the moonlight, you see by yourself.
