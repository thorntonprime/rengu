Title: Being Obscure
---
My words are so easy to understand,
so easy to follow,

and yet nobody in the world
understands or follows them.

Words come from an ancestry,
deeds from a mastery：
when these are unknown, so am I.

In my obscurity
is my value.
That’s why the wise
wear their jade under common clothes.
