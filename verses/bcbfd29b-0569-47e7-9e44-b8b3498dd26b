Great Master Ma and Baizhang were walking to a rest
stop. Seeing young wild ducks passing in flight, Great Master said,
"What's that?"

Zhang said, "Young wild ducks."

Great Master said, "To what place are they going away?"

Zhang said, "They passed in flight and are gone away."

Great Master proceeded to twist the tip of Baizhang's
nose.

Zhang did suffer the pain and cried out.

Great Master said, " How have they already flown and
gone away?"
