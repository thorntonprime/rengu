Title: I Want to Forget
---
Others think about their love
but I try to forget mine.
The more I try to forget, the more I remember.

Remembering, I tried to forget,
but if I forget then I remember,
and if I remember, I can't forget.

Shall I try to stop forgetting and remembering?
Shall I try to throw both away?
Neither will work.
What can I do when my love fills every thought?

It's not impossible to forget
in a case of deliberate forgetting.
But that means sleeping or dying,
and because of love I can do neither.

Greater than the remembering that can't be forgotten
is the difficulty of trying to forget.
