Title: Making Space
---
What You are able to do
in me depends on the quality

of my life and whether there
is enough space for You to

act as You wish to do, and
my work is simply to shake

myself loose of what I
think or expect You desire

so that You might find
in my naked nothingness

enough room for You to
be the love You ever are

and long to set free in me.
