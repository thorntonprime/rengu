Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raiment?

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow： they toil not.
neither do they spin; And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe
you, O ye of little faith?

Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things.  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you.
