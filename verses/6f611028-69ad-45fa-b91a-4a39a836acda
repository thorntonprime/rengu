It must be observed that the fact of most significance is the extent to
which this deepening and softening of character has progressed among the
power-holding class. This class is even more affected than the opposing
party. The result is peculiar. It is thereby rendered incapable of utilizing
its own strength, and consequently of making any effective resistance to
the movement which is undermining its position. All heart is, in fact, taken
out of its opposition; men's minds have become so insensitive to suffering,
misery, wrong, and degradation of every kind, that it cannot help itself.
