I'm used to living in some hidden, shaded,
 mountain place,
but once in a while I walk straight into the
 Kuo-ch'ing Temple,
and sometimes I pay a call on old Feng Kan,
or go to see that honorable sir, Shih Te, the
 foundling.
But then I come home, alone, to my cold cliff.
No one's talk makes perfect harmony with mine.
I search a stream that has no source.
The spring dried up, but the stream water's still
 flowing.
