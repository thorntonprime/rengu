Great perfection seems to need repair
and yet its usefulness is not impaired.
Great fullness seems like empty air
and yet its usefulness is everywhere.

Great directedness may seem wayward.
Great mastery may seem haphazard.
Great eloquence may seem awkward.

Movement stirs the cold.
Stillness calms the heat.

When purity and stillness reign,
all things under heaven gain.
