  Title: Meister Eckhart
---
Realize this clearly,
that whatever leads you closest to the inner truth,
you are to follow in all you do.

Let your spirit be uplifted and not downcast,
burning and yet pure,
silent and quiet.

You need not say to God what you need or desire,
for He knows all beforehand.

That we may follow his peace and inward silence,
that the eternal word may be spoken in us and understood,
and that we may be one with Him.
may the Father help us,
and the Word, and the spirit of both.

Amen.
