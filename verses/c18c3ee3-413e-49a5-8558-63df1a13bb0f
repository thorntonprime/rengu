Title: Becoming Love, II
---
When I learn to love You
simply because You are love,

I come to accept myself simply
because You made me in love

and You never stop making me.
And when I hold onto this and

let go of every doubt, I find
Your love in everything

and I become love in You
and You become love in me.
