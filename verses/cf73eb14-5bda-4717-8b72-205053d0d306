It is related that the Messiah (God bless him and grant him peace!)
passed in his wandering a man asleep wrapped up in his cloak; then he
wakened him and said, ‘O sleeper, arise and glorify God (Exalted is
He!).’ Then the man said, ‘What do you want from me? Verily I have
abandoned the world to its people.’ So he said to him, ‘Sleep, then,
my friend.’
