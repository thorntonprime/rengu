At the beginning of the beginning, even nothing did not exist.
Then came the period of the Nameless. When ONE came into existence,
there was ONE, but it was formless. When things got that by which they
came into existence, it was called their virtue  ... By cultivating
this nature, we are carried back to virtue; and if this is perfected,
we become as all things were in the beginning. We become unconditioned.
