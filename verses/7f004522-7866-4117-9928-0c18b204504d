Title: The Work of the Cell
---
Coming home -- through Shakertown, Harrodsburg, Perryville, and
Lebanon. Beautiful June countryside -- deep grass and hay, flowering
weeds, tall cumulus clouds, corn 3 foot high and beautifully green tobacco
struggling to begin. The old road between Perryville and Lebanon-winding
between small farms and old barns, with wooded knobs nearby -- is one I like.

The great joy of the solitary life is not found simply in quiet, in the
beauty and peace of nature, song of birds, etc., nor in the peace of
one’s own heart, but in the awakening and attuning of the heart to the
voice of God -- to the inexplicable, quite definite inner certitude of
one’s call to obey Him, to hear Him, to worship Him here, now, today,
in silence and alone, and that this is the whole reason for one’s
existence, this makes one’s existence fruitful and gives fruitfulness
to all one’s other good acts, and is the ransom and purification of
one’s heart, which has been dead in sin.

It is not simply a question of “existing” alone, but of doing, with joy
and understanding, “the work of the cell,” which is done in silence
and not according to one’s own choice or the pressure of necessity,
but in obedience to God. But theVoice of God is not “heard” at every
moment, and part of the “work of the cell” is attention so that one
may not miss any sound of thatVoice. When we see how little we listen,
and how stubborn and gross our hearts are, we realize how important the
work is and how badly prepared we are to do it.
