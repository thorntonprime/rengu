Dear friend, now at last I can breathe. Everything is doable now. For this
was huge beyond imagining. In these days and nights I bellowed as I did back
then at Duino. But even after that struggle I did not dream that such a storm
of heart and spirit could come over me. That I survived it! That I survived it.

Enough. It is here.

I went outside in the cold moonlight and I caressed this little chateau
Muzot as though it were a living thing-the old walls that harbored me-just
as Duino once did.

Let this be calledï¼š The Duino Elegies.
