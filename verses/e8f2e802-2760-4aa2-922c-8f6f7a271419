Call a man a sycophant and he flushes with anger; call him a flatterer
and he turns crimson with rage. Yet all his life he will continue to be
a sycophant, all his life he will continue to be a flatterer. See him
set forth his analogies and polish his fine phrases to draw a crowd,
until the beginning and end, the root and branches of his argument no
longer match!  See him spread out his robes, display his bright
colors, put on a solemn face in hopes of currying favor with the age -
and yet he does not recognize himself as a sycophant or a flatterer.
See him with his followers laying down the law on right and wrong and
yet he does not recognize himself as one of the mob. This is the height
of foolishness!
