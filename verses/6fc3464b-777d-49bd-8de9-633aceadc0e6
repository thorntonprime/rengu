\'Many are called, but few chosen;’ for they will not; they give their
free will into God’s anger* where they are even apprehended, and so
are chosen to be ‘children of wrath;’ . . .  for God’s love chooses
only its likeness, and so likewise God’s anger.  ...

Thus also man perishes among the evil company in evil vain ways; God
offers him his grace that he should repent; but evil company and the
devil lead him in wicked ways, till he be even too hard captivated in
the anger; and then it goes very hardly with him; he indeed was
called, but he is evil; God chuses only children; Seeing he is evil,
the choice passes over him; but if he again reforms and amends, the
eternal choice (or election) does again receive him.
