Title: A Blue Ribbon Rear End
Description: August 6
---
It would be easy to change the world. It could happen in a couple of days,
if everyone with a blue ribbon rear end agreed to not let any rich or powerful
 person touch it!
Touch it -- unless all those gilded weirdos made some serious promises to
 revamp their strange ways.
Think of all the leverage that we could then have; we could begin to sway
 major elections,
we could get seats on corporate boards, we could take over the stock market
 and the Vatican too, I bet. Hmmmm!
Yes, it is bound to work, with promiscuity and lustâ€™s charms having most
 in a full nelson.
