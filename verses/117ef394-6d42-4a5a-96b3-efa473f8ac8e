Yao wanted to cede the empire to Hsu-Yu. "When the sun and moon have
already come out," he said, "it's a waste of light to go on burning the
torches, isn't it? When the seasonal rains are falling, it's a waste of
water to go on irrigating the fields. If you took the throne, the world
would be well ordered. I go on occupying it, but all I can see are my
failings. I beg to turn over the world to you."
