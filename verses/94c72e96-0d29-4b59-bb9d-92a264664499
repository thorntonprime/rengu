God created the soul according to his own most perfect nature that she might
be the bride of his only-begotten Son. He knowing this full well decided to
go forth out of the private chamber of his eternal Fatherhood where he has
slept for aye and be proclaimed abroad while inwardly abiding in the first
beginning of his primitive light-nature. ... He proceeded out of the supreme
in order to go in again accompanied by his bride and show her the hidden
mystery of his secret Godhead, where he is at peace with himself and with
all creatures.
