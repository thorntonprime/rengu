Title: Day of a Stranger
---
The hills are blue and hot. There is a brown, dusty field in the bottom
of the valley. I hear a machine, a bird, a clock. The clouds are high and
enormous. In them, the inevitable jet plane passes： this time probably
full of fat passengers from Miami to Chicago, but presently it will be
a plane with a bomb in it. I have seen the plane with the bomb in it fly
low over me, and I have looked up out of the woods directly at the closed
bay. Like everyone else, I live under the bomb. But, unlike most people,
I live in the woods. Do not ask me to explain this. I am embarrassed to
describe it. I live in the woods out of necessity. I am both a prisoner and
an escaped prisoner. I cannot tell you why, born in France, my journey ended
here. I have tried to go further but I cannot. It makes no difference. When
you are beginning to be old, and I am beginning to be old, for I am fifty,
both times and places no longer take on the same meaning. Do I have a
“day”? Do I spend my “day” in a “place”? I know there are trees here. I know
there are birds here. I know the birds in fact very well, for there are
exactly fifteen pairs of birds living in the immediate area of my cabin
and I share this particular place with them： we form an ecological
balance. This harmony gives “place” a different configuration.
