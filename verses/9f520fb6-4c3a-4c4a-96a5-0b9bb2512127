When you come to a certain point of the so-called expansion of your love
and vision, it undergoes a sudden and lightning change into the Universal
Consciousness. It is Jiva realising that it is Brahman. Jiva is the individual
soul. As soon as the ignorance which has obsessed the soul is removed,
that instant it realises that it is the Supreme Spirit. In regard to this
transformation, there are no intermediary stages. The stages are only, Ramdas
repeats, in the process of self-purification which helps to break the barriers
between us and God and grants us the knowledge that we are one with Him.
