Are we only to look at flowers in full bloom, at the moon when it is clear?

Nay, to look out on the rain and long for the moon, to draw the blinds and
not to be aware of the passing of the spring -- these arouse even deeper
feelings. There is much to be seen in young boughs about to flower, in
gardens strewn with withered blossom. Men are wont to regret that the
moon has waned or that the blossoms have fallen, and this must be so;
but they must be perverse indeed who will say, “This branch, that bough
is withered, now there is nought to see.”
