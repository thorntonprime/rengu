Shen-t'u Chia said, "Within the gates of the Master, is there any such
thing as a prime minister? You take delight in being a prime minister
and pushing people behind you. But I've heard that if the mirror is
bright, no dust settles on it; if dust settles, it isn't really bright.
When you live around worthy men a long time, you'll be free of faults.
You regard the Master as a great man, and yet you talk like this - it's
not right, is it?"
