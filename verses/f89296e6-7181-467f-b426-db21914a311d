I pay no attention to words or realities outside myself --
but only to that which comes directly from my heart.
Words have no substance or final cause in themselves.
The substance is in the heart, which is the interpretation of the words.
To dwell on words is to dwell on superficialities.
I want to set the heart on fire with love,
and I want to be the fire --
consuming all thoughts and expressions.
