Where there is realization outside the senses it is infallible. It is proved
not by extraneous evidence but in the transformed conduct and character
of those who have felt the real presence of God within. Such testimony is
to be found in the experiences of an unbroken line of prophets and sages
in all countries and climes. To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.
