Seek His face, I beg you, and you will enjoy forever. Do not move to touch
Him, I beg you, for He is stability. Do not distract yourself over various
things in order to reach Him, for He is unity itself. Halt the movement,
unite the multiplicity, and immediately you will reach God, who has long
since reached you wholly.
