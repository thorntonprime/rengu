Title: The You Pronoun
Description: March 9
---
Someone asked once, What is love?

Be lost in me, I said. You will know love when that happens.

Love has no calculating in it. That is why it is said to be a quality
of God and not of human beings.

God loves you is the only possible sentence. The subject becomes the
object so totally that it can't be turned around. Who will the you
pronoun stand for if you say, You love God?
