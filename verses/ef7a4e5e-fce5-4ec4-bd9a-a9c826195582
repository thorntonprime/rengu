The intellectual working of the brain alone is not sufficient to give
birth to a physicianï¼š the true physician is not he who has merely
heard the truth, but he who feels the truth, who sees it before him
as clearly as the light of the sun, who hears it as he would hear the
noise of the cataract of the Rhine or the whistling of the storm upon
the ocean, who smells it and tastes it. ... The true philosopher sees
the reality, not merely the outward appearance. He who knows the sun
and the moon has a sun and a moon in him, and he can tell how they
look, even if his eyes are shut. Likewise, the true physician sees in
himself the whole constitution of the microcosm of man with all its
parts. He sees the constitution of his patient as if the latter were
a clear crystal, in which not even a single hair could escape
detection. He sees him as he would the stones and pebbles at the
bottom of a clear well.
