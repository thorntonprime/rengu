Then spoke the Buddha Nang-wa-t’a-ya (Infinite Brightness), the Perfect
Buddha, also called Wu-pa-mé (Light Eternal)： ‘Most Compassionate
P'apa Shen-ra-zig Wang-ch’yuk,* by the following six letters the door of
birth for the six classes of created beings may be closed; Om manipadmé
hum. By Om the gate of birth among gods (Lh’a) is closed; by ma the gate
of birth among Titans (L h ’a-ma-yin) is closed; by ni the gate of birth
among men is closed; by pad the gate of birth among brute beasts is closed;
by mé the gate of birth among prêtas (Yidag) is closed; and by hum the
gate of birth in hell is closed. These can empty the kingdoms of the six
classes of creatures. ... Understand them well, remember them, repeat them,
impress them well upon your mind.'
