Title: For Us This Day
---
My soul keeps whispering, Quickly,
be a wandering dervish,
a salamander sitting in its homefire.

Walk about watching the burning
turn to roses. As this love-secret
we are both blasphemy and the core of Islam.

Do not wait. The open plain is better
than any closing door. Ravens love ruins
and cemetery trees. They cannot help but fly there.

But for us this day is friends sitting together
with silence shining in our faces.
