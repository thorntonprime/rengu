Once upon a time, I, Chuang-tse, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither
and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of
following my fancies as a butterfly, and was unconscious of my individuality
as a man. Suddenly, I awaked, and there I lay, myself again. Now I do not
know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now
a butterfly dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is
necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of
material things.
