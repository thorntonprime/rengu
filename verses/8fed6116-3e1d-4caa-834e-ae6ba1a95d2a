But all mistaken you and all like you
That long for that lost Eden as the true;
Fair as it was, still nothing but the Shade
And Out-court of the Majesty that made. ...
For so Creation’s Master-Jewel fell
From that same Eden： loving which too well,
The Work before the Artist did prefer,
And in the Garden lost the Gardener.
