This the Sâtyakîrtas say： ‘As to the Angel whom we worship, of him we say that
there is one aspect in the cow, another in beasts of burden, another in the
elephant, another in man (purusa), another in all existences; such is the
Angel’s omni-aspectuality (sarvam rûparh).’ That same single aspect is the
Spirit (prâna).
