Title: Fade to Grey
---
I don't want to feel this way, a trigger click and I fade to grey
I don't know where this is coming from

And I don't want to watch you bleed, dealing with the things I've seen
Help me find a way to overcome

It's a terrible thing to say, when you lie, saying everythings ok. Ok.

It's a miserable way to live, when you keep everything that you have
to give, so give.

It's a terrible thing to say when you lie, saying everythings ok, we're not ok

Statistics always have a way of telling us we're not ok, that our
chances here are slim to none I will cross my broken heart, you saw me
here right from the start, I'm gonna change this world or watch it
burn

Cause I don't want to feel this way, I don't want to feel this way
