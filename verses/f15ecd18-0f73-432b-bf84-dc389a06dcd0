As soon as we become one with the ocean in the shape of God, there is no
more rest for us, nor indeed do we need rest any longer. Our very sleep is
action. For we sleep with the thought of God in our hearts. This restlessness
constitutes true rest. This never-ceasing agitation holds the key to peace
ineffable. This supreme state of total surrender is difficult to describe,
but not beyond the bounds of human experience. It has been attained by
many dedicated souls, and may be attained by ourselves as well.
