At the end of the first Epistle of Saint Paul to the Corinthians： “I
shall know even as I have been known.”

It is in the passion of Christ that God has proved to us that He has
“known” us.That He has recognized us in our misery. That He has found
His lost image in our fallen state and reclaimed it for His own, cleansed
in the charity ofHis Divine Son.

It is on the Cross that God has known us： that He has searched our
souls with His compassion and experienced the full extent of capacity for
wickedness： it is on the Cross that He has known our exile, and ended it,
and brought us home to Him.

We have to return to Him though the same gate of charity by which He came
to us. If we had to open the gate ourselves, we could never do it. He has
done the work. It is for us to follow Him and enter in by all those things
that go together to fulfill in us the law of charity, in which all virtues
are complete.
