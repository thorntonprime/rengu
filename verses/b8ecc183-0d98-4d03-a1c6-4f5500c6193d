Title: Sourceless
Commentary: |
  Everything Lao Tzu says is elusive. The temptation is to grasp at something
  tangible in the endlessly deceptive simplicity of the words. Even some of his
  finest scholarly translators focus on positive ethical or political values
  in the text, as if those were what’s important in it. And of course the
  religion called Taoism is full of gods, saints, miracles, prayers, rules,
  methods for securing riches, power, longevity, and so forth -- all the stuff
  that Lao Tzu says leads us away from the Way.

  In passages such as this one, I think it is the profound modesty of the
  language that offers what so many people for so many centuries have found
  in this book： a pure apprehension of the mystery of which we are part.

The way is empty,
used, but not used up.
Deep, yes! ancestral
to the ten thousand things.

Blunting edge,
loosing bond,
dimming light,
the way is the dust of the way.

Quiet,
yes, and likely to endure.
Whose child? born
before the gods.
