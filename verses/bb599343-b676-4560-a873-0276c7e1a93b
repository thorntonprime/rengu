Do thou all within. And if perchance thou seekest some high place,
some holy place, make thee a temple for God within. For the temple of
God is holy; which you are (I Cor. iii. 17). In a temple wouldest
thou pray? Pray within thyself. Only first be thou a temple of God.
because he in his temple will hear him that prayeth.
