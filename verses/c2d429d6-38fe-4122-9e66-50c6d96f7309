Title: What Lies Ahead
---
Nothing alien happens to us, but only what has long been our own. We have
already had to rethink so many concepts about motion; now we must also
begin to learn that what we call fate comes not from outside us but from
within. ... Just as for so long we were mistaken about the movement of the
sun, we are still mistaken about what lies ahead of us in time.
