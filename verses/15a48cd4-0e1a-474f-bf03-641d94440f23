Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Emptiness, stillness, limpidity, silence, inaction are the root of the
ten thousand things. To understand them and face south is to become a
ruler such as Yao was; to understand them and face north is to become a
minister such as Shun was. To hold them in high station is the Virtue
of emperors and kings, of the Son of Heaven; to hold them in lowly
station is the way of the dark sage, the uncrowned king. Retire with
them to a life of idle wandering and you will command first place among
the recluses of the rivers and seas, the hills and forests. Come
forward with them to succor the age and your success will be great,
your name renowned, and the world will be united. In stillness you will
be a sage, in action a king. Resting in inaction, you will be honored;
of unwrought simplicity, your beauty will be such that no one in the
world may vie with you.
