This itself is the whole journey：
opening your heart to that which is lovely.
Because of their feelings for the lovely,
beings who are afraid of birth and death,
  aging and decaying, are freed of fear.

This is the way you must train yourself：
I will become a friend and intimate of the lovely.
To do this I must closely observe and embrace
  all states of the mind that are good.
