In this state we perform a powerful prayer, the prayer of Jesus Christ,
and through His spirit. The soul can then no more pray with cogitation and
make conclusive reasonings, since she is found in a continual and working
prayer. All that the soul is and what is in her prays through and in Jesus
Christ; and being not intent upon her own will, nor thinking discerningly
on what she prays for, she receives at once what she has need of.
