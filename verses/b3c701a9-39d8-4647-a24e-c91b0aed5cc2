May you always have those things you hold dear,
and may you always do what you love.
But go forward swiftly, and lightly of step,
never swerving from the path to ultimate joy.
Do not believe or agree with anything that
discourages you from being resolute,
or causes you to stumble --
so that you may offer up your vows to God,
pursuing the path to perfection
to which the Lord has called you.
