Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher
---
Knowing what it is that Heaven does, he lives with Heaven. Knowing what
it is that man does, he uses the knowledge of what he knows to help out
the knowledge of what he doesn't know, and lives out the years that
Heaven gave him without being cut off midway - this is the perfection
of knowledge.
