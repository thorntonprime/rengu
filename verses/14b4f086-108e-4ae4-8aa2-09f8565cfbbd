In my opinion someone who was really good at handling the affairs of
the world would not go about it like this. The people have their
constant inborn nature. To weave for their clothing, to till for their
food - this is the Virtue they share. They are one in it and not
partisan, and it is called the Emancipation of Heaven. Therefore in a
time of Perfect Virtue the gait of men is slow and ambling; their gaze
is steady and mild. In such an age mountains have no paths or trails,
lakes no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things live species by
species, one group settled close to another. Birds and beasts form
their flocks and herds, grass and trees grow to fullest height. So it
happens that you can tie a cord to the birds and beasts and lead them
about, or bend down the limb and peer into the nest of the crow and the
magpie. In this age of Perfect Virtue men live the same as birds and
beasts, group themselves side by side with the ten thousand things. Who
then knows anything about "gentleman" or "petty man"? Dull and
ununwitting, men have no wisdom; thus their Virtue does not depart
from them. Dull and unwitting, they have no desire; this is called
uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity the people attain their
true nature.
