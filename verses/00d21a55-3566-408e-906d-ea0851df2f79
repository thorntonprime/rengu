Music Master Chin said, "Before the straw dogs are presented at the
sacrifice, they are stored in bamboo boxes and covered over with
patterned embroidery, while the impersonator of the dead and the priest
fast and practice austerities in preparation for fetching them. But
after they have once been presented, then all that remains for them is
to be trampled on, head and back, by passers-by; to be swept up by the
grasscutters and burned. And if anyone should come along and put them
back in their bamboo boxes, cover them over with patterned embroidery,
and linger or lie down to sleep beneath them, he would dream no proper
dreams; on the contrary, he would most certainly be visited again and
again by nightmares.
