The Divine Name is a powerful boat that takes man across the whirlpools of
life to the haven of his eternal and spiritual nature. His Name transforms man
from the human to the Divine. The Divine Name is the one sovereign panacea
for all physical, mental, and intellectual ills that have created the sense
of diversity and misery in the world.
