It so happened to Dhu ’l-Nûn the Egyptian that a new agitation and madness was
born within him.

His agitation became so great that salt from it was reaching hearts up to above
the sky.

Beware, O thou of salty soil, do not put thy agitation beside the agitation of
the holy lords.

The people could not endure his madness; his fire was carrying off their
beards.1

When that fire fell on the beards of the vulgar, they bound him and put him in
a prison.

There is no possibility of pulling back this rein, though the vulgar be
distressed by this way.
