As for the mere word-by-word explication of these dialectics, thou thyself art
sufficiently expert; but to realize their true import it is necessary to
renounce the Eight Worldly Ambitions, lopping off their heads, to subdue the
illusion of belief in the personal ego, and, regarding Nirvâna and Sangsâra as
inseparable, to conquer the spiritual ego by meditation in mountain solitudes.
I have never valued or studied the mere sophistry of wordknowledge, set down in
books in conventionalized form of questions and answers to be committed to
memory (and fired off at one’s opponent); these lead but to mental confusion
and not to such practice as bringeth actual realization of Truth. Of such
word-knowledge I am ignorant; and if ever I did know it, I have forgotten it
long ago.
