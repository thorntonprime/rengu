Title: To Be Patient with Sadness
---
The quieter we are, the more patient and open we are in our sadnesses, the more
deeply and unerringly a new revelation can enter us, and the more we can make
it our own. Later on when it "happens" -- when it manifests in our response
to another person -- we will feel it as belonging to our innermost being.
