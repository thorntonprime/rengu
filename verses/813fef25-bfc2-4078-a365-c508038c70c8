Title: Waking from a Dream
---
If it’s you, you would love me,
but is it love to come to my door every night then go,
  leaving only the sound of footsteps?
My footsteps have never been outside your door.
Maybe only you can love?
If your footsteps hadn’t awakened me
I would be riding a cloud seeking you.
