Title: Please tell me
---
Why do you do all that fasting?
Why pray on your knees?
What's with all the devotions
    and good works?

Why be baptized?
What for?
Why did God bother with flesh?
Surely he had other
things to do.

Only one reason.

God wanted to be born in your soul.
The whole world was born,
the scriptures bothered to be written,
to find a home
    inside you.
