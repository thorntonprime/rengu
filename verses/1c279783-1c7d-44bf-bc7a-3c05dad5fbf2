Title: Out of Touch and Left Behind
---
The “spiritual preoccupations” of this time -- the post-Vatican II
Conciliar years. (An imaginary era we have thought up for ourselves --
divertissement!) I need perhaps to be less preoccupied with them, to show
that one can be free of them, and go one's own way in peace. But there
is inculcated in us such a fear of being out of everything, out of touch,
left behind. This fear is a form of tyranny, a law -- and one is faced with
a choice between this law and true grace, hidden, paradoxical, but free..

An unformulated “preoccupation" of our time- the conviction that it is
precisely in these (collective) preoccupations that the Holy Spirit is at
work. To be “preoccupied with the current preoccupations" is then the best-
if not the only -- way to be open to the Spirit.

Hence one must know what everybody is saying, read what everybody is reading,
keep up with everything or be left behind by the Holy Spirit. Is this a
perversion of the idea of the Church- a distortion of perspective due to
the Church's situation in the world of mass communications? I wonder if this
anxiety to keep up is not in fact an obstacle to the Holy Spirit.
