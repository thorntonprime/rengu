How many of ours and our fathers' years have flowed away through Thy
'to-day', and from it received the measure and the mould of such being as
they had; and still others shall flow away, and so receive the mould of their
degree of being. But Thou art still the same, and all things of to-morrow,
and all beyond, and all of yesterday, and all behind it, Thou wilt do in
this To-day, Thou hast done in this To-day. What is it to me, though any
comprehend not this?
