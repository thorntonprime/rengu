(The saints of Mary) shall be clouds thundering and flying through the
air at the least breath of the Holy Ghost; who, detaching themselves
from everything and troubling themselves about nothing, shall shower
forth the rain of the Word of God and of life eternal. They shall
thunder against sin; they shall storm against the world; they shall
strike the devil and his crew; and they shall pierce through and
through, for life or for death, with their two-edged sword of the Word
of God, all those to whom they shall be sent on the part of the Most
High.
