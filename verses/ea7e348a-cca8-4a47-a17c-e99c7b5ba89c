And here, thou dear seeker, when thou seest the crimson-coloured blood of the
young man (self-hood) arise out of death with the virginâ€™s white blood (divine
essence), then know that thou hast the arcanum of the whole world, and a
treasure in this valley of misery, which surpasses the value of gold; take it
and esteem it more excellent and sovereign than that which shall again arise
from death; If thou beest born of God. then thou wilt understand what I mean.
