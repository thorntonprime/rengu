Experience has taught me that silence is a part of the spiritual discipline
of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or modify the
truth wittingly or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of man, and silence
is necessary in order to surmount it. A man of few words will rarely be
thoughtless in his speech; he will measure every word.
