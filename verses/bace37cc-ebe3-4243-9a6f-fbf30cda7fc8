You are in the world of things that come to be, and yet you seek to be at rest.
But how can anything be at rest in the world of things that come to be? A boat,
as long as it floats on the water, cannot be still or at rest; or if at any
moment it is still, it is so only by chance, and forthwith the water begins
again to shake and toss the things which float upon its surface. Then only is
the boat at rest, when it is taken out of the water, and drawn up on the land,
which is the place of the boatâ€™s origin, and is on a par with the boat in
density and weight; then, but not till then, is the boat truly at rest. And
even so, the soul, as long as it is involved in the processes of the physical
world, cannot be still, nor be at rest, nor get any respite; but if it returns
to its source and root, then it is still and is at rest, and reposes from the
misery and debasement of its wandering in a foreign land.
