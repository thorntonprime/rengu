Title: Daguang Did A Dance

\[no pointer to this case]

Raised ：

A monk asked Daguang, " Changqing state, ' to cause celebration and
praise of the meal.' So what was the intended purpose?"

Daguang did a dance.

The monk offered obeisance. Guang said, "What do you see particularly
to then offer obeisance?"

The monk did a dance.

Guang said, "This wild fox spirit."

Xuedou's ode says：

The preceding arrow was still slight, the later arrow was deep.

Who says the leaves are yellow or gold?

Like an imitation of the billowing waves of Caoxi,

Limitless average people blanket the shore to sink.
