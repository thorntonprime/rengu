Commentary: Since infinity by definition excludes a plurality, the translation
  could better be rendered by a word such as 'indefinitude.'

The one and only thing required is to free oneself from the bondage of mind
and body alike, putting the Buddha’s own seal upon yourself. If you do
this as you sit in ecstatic meditation, the whole universe itself scattered
through the infinities of space turns into enlightenment. This is what I
mean by the Buddha’s seal.
