Title: Three Sprigs of Heather
---
Never has heather so touched and even moved me as when I found these three
sprigs in your dear letter. Since then they lie in the pages of my Book
of Images and permeate them with their strong, serious fragrance which
is actually only the scent of autumnal Earth. And how marvelous is this
scent. Never, it seems to me, has Earth so let herself be inhaled in one
single fragrance. The ripe Earth, in one fragrance that is no less intense
than that of the sea： bitter if you could taste it and more like honey
if you could hear it. Such depths in it, of darkness, almost of the grave,
and yet again wind, tar and turpentine and Ceylon tea. Serious and destitute
like a beggar-monk, while also like the most precious incense, hearty and
resinous. And to behold it： these sprigs of heather are like most elegant
embroidery-with the violet-hued silk (a violet so moist it could be the sun's
complementary color) stitching cypresses in a Persian carpet. You had to
have seen that. I think that the little sprigs could not have been so lovely
before you put them in your letter. You must have told them something amazing.
