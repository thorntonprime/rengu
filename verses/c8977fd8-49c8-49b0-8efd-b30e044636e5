Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
Long ago, when the sage Yao governed the world, he made the world
bright and gleeful; men delighted in their nature, and there was no
calmness anywhere. When the tyrant Chieh governed the world, he made
the world weary and vexed; men found bitterness in their nature and
there was no contentment anywhere. To lack calmness, to lack
contentment is to go against Virtue, and there has never been anyone in
the world who could go against Virtue and survive for long.
