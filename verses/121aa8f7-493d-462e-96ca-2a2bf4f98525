  - Discernment-Truth=The Void=The Shattering of Forms
By: Shaykh Ahmad al-'Alawi
---
Being in itself is God’s, not thine; if thou shouldst come to realize the truth
of the matter, and to understand what is God’s through stripping thyself of all
that is not thine, then wouldst thou find thyself to be as the core of an
onion. If thou wouldst peel it, thou peelest off the first skin, and then the
second, and then the third, and so on, until there is nothing left of the
onion. Even so is the slave with regard to the Being of the Truth.
