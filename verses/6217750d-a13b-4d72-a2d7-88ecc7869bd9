Fame or no-name,
which means more?
Self or wealth?,
the choice is yours.
With or without,
think either-or.

Pursuing pleasures will meet great cost.
Amassing treasures will meet great loss.

To know good measure frees a man from shame.
To act in good measure frees a man from claim,
and so he endures.
