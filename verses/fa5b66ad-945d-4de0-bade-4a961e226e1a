Neighbour： Why has God created wicked people?

Master： That is His will, His play. In His mâyâ there exists avidyâ as well
as vidyâ.  Darkness is needed too. It reveals all the more the glory of light.
There is no doubt that anger, lust, and greed are evils. Why, then, has God
created them? In order to create saints. ... Again, see how His whole play of
creation is perpetuated through lust.
