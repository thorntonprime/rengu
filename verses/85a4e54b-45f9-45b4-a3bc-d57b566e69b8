The tendency of people to be fearful of those experiences they call apparitions
or assign to the "spirit world", including death, has done infinite harm
to life. All these things so naturally related to us have been driven away
through our daily resistance to them, to the point where our capacity to sense
them has atrophied. To say nothing of God. Fear of the unexplainable has not
only impoverished our inner lives, but also diminished relations between
people; these have been dragged, so to speak, from the river of infinite
possibilities and stuck on the dry bank where nothing happens. For it is not
only sluggishness that makes human relations so unspeakably monotonous, it is
the aversion to any new, unforeseen experience we are not sure we can handle.
