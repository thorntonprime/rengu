Doctors debate which is the nobler, knowledge or love. Some say that love is
better than knowledge. I say it is not. Our best authorities declare that
knowledge is nobler than love. Love and will take God as being good. If God
were not good, will would have none of him; if God were not lovely, love would
scout him. But understanding would not. Knowledge is not confined either to
good or to love or to wisdom or lordship. By putting names to God the soul is
only dressing him up and making a figure of God; nor is this the doing of
knowledge. Though God were neither good nor wise, still understanding would
seize him; it strips everything off, not stopping either at wisdom or good, nor
majesty nor power. It pierces to naked being and grasps God bare, ere he is
clothed in thought with wisdom and goodness.
