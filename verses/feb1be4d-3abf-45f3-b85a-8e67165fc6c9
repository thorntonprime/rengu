Quoth Our Lord, ‘The hour cometh and is now, when true worshippers shall
worship not only on the mountains and in the Temple but in spirit, in the
place of God.’ The moral of which is that we ought to pray to God not only
on the hill tops and in churches, but we ought always to be praying, at all
times and everywhere. St Paul says, ‘Rejoice evermore; in everything give
thanks; pray without ceasing.'
