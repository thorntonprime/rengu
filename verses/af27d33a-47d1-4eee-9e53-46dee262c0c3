Title: The Bodhi Tree and the Mirror

    The body is a bodhi tree,
        the mind a mirror bright.
    Take care and wipe them always clean
        lest dust on them alight.

Hui-neng replied：

    The body is no bodhi tree,
         the mind no mirror bright.
    Since nothing at the root exists,
         on what shall what dust then alight?
