O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you
from remembrance of Allâh. Those who do so, they are the losers.

And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh
unto one of you and he saith： My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve
me for a little while, then I would give alms and be among the
righteous.

But Allâh reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allâh is
Informed of what ye do.
