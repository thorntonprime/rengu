Suppose that a being enjoyeth the possession, in various ways, of mystic
power： from being one, he becometh multiform ; from being multiform, he
becometh one ; from being visible, he becometh invisible; he passeth without
hindrance to the further side of a wall or battlement, or a mountain, as if
through air; he walketh on water without dividing it, as if on solid ground;
he travelleth cross-legged through the sky, like the birds on the wing.
