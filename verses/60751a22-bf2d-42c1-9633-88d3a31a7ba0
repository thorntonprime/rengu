\ ... the consent of mankind has always, in spite of the philosophers,
given precedence to the soldier. And this is right.

For the soldier’s trade, verily and essentially, is not slaying, but
being slain. This, without well knowing its own meaning, the world honours
it for. A bravo’s trade is slaying; but the world has never respected
bravos more than merchants; the reason it honours the soldier is because
he holds his life at the service of the State. Reckless he may be --
fond of pleasure or of adventure -- all kinds of bye-motives and mean
impulses may have determined the choice of his profession, and may affect
(to all appearance exclusively) his daily conduct in it; our estimate of
him is based upon this ultimate fact -- of which we are well assured --
that put him in a fortress breach, with all the pleasures of the world
behind him and only death and his duty in front of him, he will keep his
face to the front; and he knows that his choice may be put to him at any
moment -- and has beforehand taken his part -- virtually takes such part
continually -- does, in reality, die daily.
