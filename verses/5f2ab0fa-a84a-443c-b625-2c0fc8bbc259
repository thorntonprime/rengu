There is, there can be only a single universal and external truth. Because
the Real exists always and can never vanish, the True exists always and
can never vanish. No prophet ever reveals it for the first time, no seer
discovers it. All only rediscover it. It never changes or evolves; only its
form of presentation does that. But before it can manifest in our world,
it must find human minds sufficiently prepared to be able to receive it and
sufficiently developed to be able to comprehend and teach it.
