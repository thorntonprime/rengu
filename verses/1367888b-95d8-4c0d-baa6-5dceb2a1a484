Ten thousand dharmas return to the One. Ultimately, the question is,
what is the One? Taking it even further, I would ask you, what does the
One return to? If you can clearly see into it here; if you can say a
turning word without explanations and without confining yourself to the
two mountains of buddha and dharma then I will grant that youâ€˜re free
to ride the clouds and follow the wind. If you have not yet seen it,
then sit single/mindedly with this koan.
