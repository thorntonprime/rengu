  - Combat-Action=Heterodoxy And Deviation=The False Light
By: John Smith the Platonist
Commentary: |
  \'In all the more or less symbolical descriptions given of him. the
  Antichrist is represented as deformed. ...  These descriptions
  especially emphasize bodily dissymmetries, which implies essentially
  that these are the visible marks of the actual nature of the being to
  whom they are attributed： and in fact they are always signs of some
  inner disequilibrium' (Guenon： Le Règne de la Quantité, p. 266).
  Guénon also insists on the ignoble, repulsive and ‘hideux' character
  attaching to psychoanalytical interpretations and spiritualist
  manifestations as a 'mark' of their origin (cf. Le Règne, ch. XXXIV).

It is observed by some, that God never suffered the devil to assume
any human shape, but with some character whereby his body might be
distinguished from the true body of a man： and surely the devil cannot
so exactly counterfeit an angel of light, but that by a discerning
mind he may be distinguished from him; as they say a beggar can never
act a prince so cunningly, but that his behaviour sometime sliding
into the course way and principles of his education, will betray the
meanness of his pedigree to one of a true noble extraction. A bare
imitation will always fall short of the copy from whence it is taken.
