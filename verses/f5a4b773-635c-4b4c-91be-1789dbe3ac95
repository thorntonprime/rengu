Thus absolute truth is indestructible. Being indestructible, it is
eternal. Being eternal, it is self-existent. Being self-existent, it
is infinite. Being infinite, it is vast and deep. Being vast and deep,
it is transcendent and intelligent. It is because it is vast and deep that
it contains all existence. It is because it is transcendent and intelligent
that it embraces all existence. It is because it is infinite and eternal that
it fulfills all existence. In vastness and depth, it is like the Earth. In
transcendent intelligence, it is like Heaven. Infinite and eternal, it is
the Infinite itself.
