Title: Summer Nights Are Long
---
When you were here, winter nights were short;
now that you’re gone, summer nights are long.
I thought my calendar was mistaken,
but the fireflies are streaming and the insects cry.
I know now whence the long nights come and where they go.
They come from the first wave of sorrow’s sea, turn into sad music,
 a vast desert,
and finally disappear through despair’s fortress into a demon’s smile.

But if you come back, I’ll take love’s knife
  and cut the night into a thousand pieces.
When you were here, winter nights were short;
now that you’re gone, summer nights are long.
