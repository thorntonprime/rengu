By: John Smith the Platonist
Commentary: An attitude that was to be cloaked with 'respectability' two
  centuries later as the evolutionist hypothesis. [As elsewhere, Perry
  seems to misunderstand fundamental points of the biological hypothesis
  of Evolution, confusing it with the alternate (and now debunked)
  hypothesis of Spontaneous Generation.]

Atheism most commonly lurks in confinio scientiae et ignorantiae; when
the minds of men begin to draw those gross, earthly vapours of sensual
and material speculations by dark and cloudy disputes, they are then
most in danger of being benighted in them. ... And certainly, were
the highest happiness of mankind such a thing as might be felt by a
corporeal touch, were it of so ignoble a birth as to spring out of
this earth, and to grow up out of this mire and clay, we might well
sit down, and bewail our unhappy fates, that we should rather be born
men than brute beasts, which enjoy more of this worldâ€™s happiness than
we can do, without any sin or guilt.
