    Title: The Pregnant Virgin
By: Marion Woodman

Out of the union of soul and spirit a child is conceived -- the Jewel in
the Lotus, the new consciousness dedicated to the possibility of Being. The
child is the new energy that steps out of the past and turns its face to
the future with hope, but lives in the now.

Organized religion once recognized the mystery of the union of the soul with
God and the fear involved. Church rituals were set up, not to do away with
the mystery, but to allow people to experience it. Western science finds
a mystery intolerable and sets out to explain it away, or even to prove it
evil. Logos thinking tries to solve the mystery, rather than enter into it.
Ritual and contemplation are not an attempt to explain the mystery, but
rather an attempt to orient individuals toward the mystery so that it may
be approached without fear. When the Holy Spirit speaks it can be terrifying
because it evokes profound fear ofthe unknown, fear oflife, fear of stepping
into our own destiny. If, however, men and women can find their own virgin
within, they can learn to 86, both alone and with each other. The mystery
lives in the possibility of Being. Love chooses us.
