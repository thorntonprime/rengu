Now, according to St Augustine, when the light of the soul eclipses creatures,
it is dawn; when the angelic light eclipses the light of the soul and devours
it, then it is broad day. David says, ‘The righteous man mounts up and up to
the perfect day.’ His path is fair and smooth and pleasant and familiar. And
when the psychic and angelic lights are swallowed up in the light divine,
he calls that high noon. Now day is at its longest, in its prime, when
the sun at its zenith pours its light into the stars and the stars pour it
into the moon. These are members of the solar system. And even so the light
of God embraces the angelic light and that of the soul, an orderly array,
an ascending scale steadily rising in the day, all praising God in chorus.
