\'Tis said, the pipe and lute that charm our ears
Derive their melody from rolling spheres. ...
We, who are parts of Adam, heard with him
The song of angels and of seraphim.
Our memory, though dull and sad, retains
Some echo still of those unearthly strains.
Oh, music is the meat of all who love.
Music uplifts the soul to realms above.
The ashes glow, the latent fires increase：
We listen and are fed with joy and peace.
