Cudgel and cane the sages and let the thieves and bandits go their way;
then the world will at last be well ordered! If the stream dries up,
the valley will be empty; if the hills wash away, the deep pools will
be filled up. And if the sage is dead and gone, then no more great
thieves will arise. The world will then be peaceful and free of fuss.
