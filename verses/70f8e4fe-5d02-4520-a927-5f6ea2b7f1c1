Deep within us all there is an amazing inner sanctuary ... a holy place, a
Divine Center, a speaking voice, to which we may continually return. Eternity
is a tour hearts, pressing upon our time-worn lives, warning us with
intimations of an astounding destiny, calling us home to Itself to be awakened.
