After the mind ceases to exist and bliss of peace has been realised, one
will find it then as difficult to bring out a thought, as he now finds it
difficult to keep out all thoughts. ... The bliss of peace is too good to
be disturbed. ... The thought-free state is oneâ€™s primal state and full
of bliss. Is it not miserable to leave such a state for the thought-ridden
and unhappy one?
