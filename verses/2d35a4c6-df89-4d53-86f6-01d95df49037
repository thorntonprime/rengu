Then along comes the sage, huffing and puffing after benevolence,
reaching on tiptoe for righteousness, and the world for the first time
has doubts; mooning and mouthing over his music, snipping and stitching
away at his rites, and the world for the first time is divided. Thus,
if the plain unwrought substance had not been blighted, how would there
be any sacrificial goblets? If the white jade had not been shattered,
how would there be any scepters and batons? If the Way and its Virtue
had not been cast aside, how would there be any call for benevolence
and righteousness? If the true form of the inborn nature had not been
abandoned, how would there be any use for rites and music? If the five
colors had not confused men, who would fashion patterns and hues? If
the five notes had not confused them, who would try to tune things by
the six tones? That the unwrought substance was blighted in order to
fashion implements - this was the crime of the artisan. That the Way
and its Virtue were destroyed in order to create benevolence and
righteousness - this was the fault of the sage.
