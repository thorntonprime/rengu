Title: My Old Freedom in the Silence of "What Is"
---
Once again the old freedom, the peace of being without care, of not being
at odds with the real sense of my own existence and with God’s grace to
me. Far better and deeper than any consolation of eros. A sense of stability
and substantiality -- of not being deceivedThough I know there was much
good in our love -- M.'s and mine -- I also see clearly how deceptive it was
and how it made me continually lie to myself. How we both loved each other
and lied to each other at the same time. How difficult it must be to keep
going in truth in a marriage. Heroic! For me the other truth is better：
the truth of simply getting along without eros and resting in the silence
of “what is.” The deep inner sustaining power of silence. When I taste
this again, so surely, after so long, I know what it means to repent of
my infidelity and foolishness; yet at the same time I do not try to build
up again anything that was properly torn down. It was good that I (we)
went through the storm： it was the only way to learn a truth that was
otherwise inaccessible.

All the old desires, the deep ones, the ones that are truly mine, come
back now. Desire of silence, peace, depth, light. I see I have been foolish
to let mySelf be so influenced by the current trends, though they perhaps
have their point. On the other hand, I know where my roots really are --
in the mystical tradition, not in the active and anxious secular city
business. Not that I don’t have an obligation to society. This evening
on the porch I sang the Alleluias and the Introit of tomorrow’s Mass.
