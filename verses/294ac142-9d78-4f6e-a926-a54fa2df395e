The crane, the cat, and the thief walk silently and calmly, and accomplish the
end that they desire; thus the holy man will always act. ... He will not for
slight purpose afflict his body, which is in the service of the Good Law; for
thus it will speedily fulfil the (vain) desires of living beings. And therefore
he will not cast away his life for one whose spirit of mercy is impure, but
only for one whose spirit is like his own; and thus naught is lost.
