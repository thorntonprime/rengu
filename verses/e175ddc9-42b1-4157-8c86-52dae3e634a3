Nanpo Tsek’uei said to Nü Yu, ‘How is it, that in spite of your great
age, you have the freshness of a child?’

Nü Yu replied. ‘Through living in conformity with Tao, I have not
become exhausted.’

‘Could I learn this doctrine?’ asked Nanpo Tsek’uei.

‘You do not have the qualifications,’ said Nü Yü. ‘There was Puliang
I; he had the disposition required. I taught him. In three days, he
had forgotten the outer world. Seven more days, and he lost the notion
of objects which surrounded him. In nine more days, he had lost the
notion of his own existence. Then he acquired clear penetration, and
with it the science of the uninterrupted chain of momentary existence.
Having acquired this knowledge, he ceased to distinguish the past from
the present and the future, life from death. He understood that in
reality killing does not take away life, nor does giving birth add to
it, that Tao sustains the being across its endings and becomings.
Hence It is justly called the Fixed Constant, since from It, the
Fixed, are derived all mutations.’
