He who affirms the duality (of God and the world) falls into the error of
associating something with God; and he who affirms the singularity of God
(in excluding from His reality all that manifests as multiple) commits the
fault of enclosing Him in a (rational) unity. Beware of comparison when
thou envisagest duality; and beware of abstracting the Divinity when thou
envisagest Unity!
