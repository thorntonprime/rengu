  Description: "Better known as Saadi, [he] was one of the major Persian\
    \ poets of the medieval period. His still very popular work is recognized\
    \ not only for the quality of his writing but also for the depth of\
    \ his social thought. A famous poem of his is displayed in the United\
    \ Nations building in New York. President Obama brought world-wide\
    \ attention to that poem in 2009, when he recited it for the commemoration\
    \ of Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Emerson translated some of Saadi's\
    \ work. And Hafiz considered Saadi a hero\u2014and teacher\u2014 as\
    \ he was growing up. Hafiz was born nearly 40 years after Saadi died.\
    \ Their tombshrines, both in Shiraz, are considered the jewels of that\
    \ city."

Title: Why Saadi Sits Alone

Your destiny is winding toward the Perfect.

Someday you will be like Saadi, who sits alone in wonder,

unable to part from the Darling One, from the Complete, each of us is
becoming.
