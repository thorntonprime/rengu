\‘Master,’ said the turtle, ‘I should not dream of accepting a reward;
but there is one thing
you can do for me. I have heard that the Buddha of the Western Heaven
knows both the past and the future. I have been perfecting myself here
for about one thousand years. This
is a pretty long span, and I have already been fortunate enough to
learn human speech; but
I still remain a turtle. I should indeed be very much obliged if you
would ask the Buddha
how long it will be before I achieve human form.’
