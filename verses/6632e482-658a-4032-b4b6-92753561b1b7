Title: Zhaozhouâ€™s Far-Reaching Way
---
Zhaozhou, instructing the assembly, said, "'The
Far-reaching Way is without difficulty, only rejecting picking and
choosing.' Only when there is language is there choosing or is there
clarity. An old monk does not exist within clarity. Are you still
fond of taking sides or not?"

At that time a monk had a question "Since one does not
exist within clarity, what part of taking of sides is there to be fond
of?"

Zhou said, "I too do not know."

Monk said, "Venerable, since you do not know, why do you
yet say you 'do not exist within clarity'?"

Zhou said, "By asking, you are able to draw near the
matter; complete the ceremonial bowing and withdraw."
