Experience has taught us to separate the pure from the impure. Therefore, if
you would ameliorate Nature, and produce a more perfect and elaborated
subject, purge the body by dissolution of all that is heterogeneous, and
unite the pure to the pure, the well-digested to the well-digested, and the
crude to the crude, according to the natural and not the material weight.
