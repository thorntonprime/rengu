It is one and the same Avatara that, having plunged into the ocean of life,
rises up in one place and is known as Krishna, and diving down again rises in
another place and is known as Christ.

The Avataras (like Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Christ) stand in relation to the
Absolute Brahma as the waves of the ocean are to the ocean.
