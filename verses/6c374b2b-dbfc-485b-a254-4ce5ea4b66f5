Once Chuang Chou dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and
fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He
didn't know he was Chuang Chou. Suddenly he woke up and there he was,
solid and unmistakable Chuang Chou. But he didn't know if he was Chuang
Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was
Chuang Chou. Between Chuang Chou and a butterfly there must be some
distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things.
