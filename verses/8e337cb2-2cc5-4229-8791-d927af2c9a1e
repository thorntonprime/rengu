Confucius said, "Life, death, preservation, loss, failure, success,
poverty, riches, worthiness, unworthiness, slander, fame, hunger,
thirst, cold, heat - these are the alternations of the world, the
workings of fate. Day and night they change place before us and wisdom
cannot spy out their source. Therefore, they should not be enough to
destroy your harmony; they should not be allowed to enter the Spirit
Storehouse. If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them and
never be at a loss for joy, if you can do this day and night without
break and make it be spring with everything, mingling with all and
creating the moment within your own mind - this is what I call being
whole in power."
