Title: You Better Rethink This
---
In case you forget, pain is there to help with your decisions.
Like if you pick up a pot that is too hot, it will burn you; that quick,
 sharp sting arrives in a second, saying ... you made a mistake, you better
 rethink this.
And if you were walking in a jungle and a roar came from some dense brush
 up ahead, would you then walk straight into that unless you were a giant
 looking to have some fun ... and duke it out with some beast for a little
 morning exercise?
It is all around and built into our senses, warnings about things we just
 should not do. Why?
Because the dance floor wants to be polished with your feet moving on it
 at night.
How will you do that sitting at home nursing wounds or feeling depressed?
