\[For, according to Heraclitus, it is not possible to step twice into
the same river, nor is it possible to touch a mortal substance twice in
so far as its state is concerned. But, thanks to the swiftness and
speed of change,] it scatters <things> and brings <them> together
again, [(or, rather, it brings together and lets go neither again nor
later, but simultaneously)] it forms and dissolves, and it approaches
and departs.
