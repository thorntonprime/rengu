One of the main lessons to learn from this war is embodied in the homely
proverb, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” Persistently only half
of this proverb has been quoted in deriding the men who wish to safeguard
our National interest and honor. Persistently the effort has been made
to insist that those who advocate keeping our country able to defend its
rights are merely adopting “the policy of the big stick.” In reality,
we lay equal emphasis on the fact that it is necessary to speak softly;
in other words, that it is necessary to be respectful toward all people
and scrupulously to refrain from wronging them, while at the same time
keeping ourselves in condition to prevent wrong done to us. If a nation
does not in this sense speak softly, then sooner or later the policy of
the big stick is certain to result in war. But what befell Luxemburg six
weeks ago, what has befallen China again and again during the past quarter
Of a century, shows that no amount of speaking softly will save any people
which does not carry a big stick.
