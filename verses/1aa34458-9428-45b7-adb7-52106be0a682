Title: The Peace of Submerged Dragons
---
A gay, bright, glorious day and a very fine Easter such as I do not remember
for a long time. The Vigil was tremendous for me and the glory of Christ
was in it. There has been splendor in everything (including the emptiness
of Good Friday morning, when rain came down in torrents and I stayed in
the hermitage).

Yesterday -- reading bits of Dame Julian ofNorwich and today I began
Gregory of Nyssa’s homilies on the Canticle. “There is not a more
dangerous tendency in history than that of representing the past as ifit
were a rational whole and dictated by clearly defined interest,” says
Huizinga. What about the present? An even greater error.

Fr. Sylvanus was in town to go to the doctor and brought back a newspaper
story about a man in the Kentucky mountains, a former coal miner, who for
thirteen years has been living as a hermit, with a dog, in a pitiful little
shack Without even a chimney and with an old car seat for a bed. “Because
of all these wars.” A real desert father, and probably not too sure why.

The hills are suddenly dark blue. Very green alfalfa in the bottoms. Yellow
or mustard or sienna sage grass in my own field. Here there is no
impatience. I am a submerged dragon. The peace of the Easter Alleluias.
