Title: That the high and the next way to heaven is run by desires,
  and not by paces of feet
---
But now peradventure thou sayest, that how should it then be? For thee thinkest
that thou hast very evidence that heaven is upwards; for Christ ascended the
air bodily upwards, and sent the Holy Ghost as He promised coming from above
bodily, seen of all His disciples; and this is our belief. And therefore
thee thinkest since thou hast thus very evidence, why shalt thou not direct
thy mind upward bodily in the time of thy prayer?

And to this will I answer thee so feebly as I can, and say： since it so was,
that Christ should ascend bodily and thereafter send the Holy Ghost bodily,
then it was more seemly that it was upwards and from above than either
downwards and from beneath, behind, or before, on one side or on other. But
else than for this seemliness, Him needed never the more to have went upwards
than downwards; I mean for nearness of the way. For heaven ghostly is as nigh
down as up, and up as down： behind as before, before as behind, on one
side as other. Insomuch, that whoso had a true desire for to be at heaven,
then that same time he were in heaven ghostly. For the high and the next
way thither is run by desires, and not by paces of feet. And therefore saith
Saint Paul of himself and many other thus; although our bodies be presently
here in earth, nevertheless yet our living is in heaven. He meant their love
and their desire, the which is ghostly their life. And surely as verily is a
soul there where it loveth, as in the body that Doeth by it and to the which
it giveth life. And therefore if we will go to heaven ghostly, it needeth
not to strain our spirit neither up nor down, nor on one side nor on other.
