Great music is lost on the ears of the villagers, but play them "The
Breaking of the Willow" or "Bright Flowers" and they grin from ear to
car. In the same way, lofty words make no impression on the minds of
the mob. Superior words gain no hearing because vulgar words are in the
majority. It is like the case of the two travelers tramping along in
confusion and never getting where they are going. With all the
confusion in the world these days, no matter how often I point the way,
what good does it do? And if I know it does no good and still make
myself do it, this too is a kind of confusion. So it is best to leave
things alone and not force them. If I don't force things, at least I
won't cause anyone any worry.
