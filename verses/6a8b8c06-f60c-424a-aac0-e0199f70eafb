Title: Concious of Withering
---
\"Oh, verily, I wither," said Confucius of himself,
and even a thousand of his words
aren't worth one picture of me.
Teeth falling out, the hair at my temples like feathers molting.
I drag my staff among the flowers,
squint right beneath the lamp at normal print,
inclined to forget what I know I ought to note,
grown accustomed to blithering on and one, and on.
"Ah, how it passes, it passes away," the stream
of life, I heard the master say.
And of the saying, "The older the better"?
Now that's a stupid one.
