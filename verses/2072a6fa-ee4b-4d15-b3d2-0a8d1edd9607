Cloudy mountains, field on field, run straight up
 the sky.
Bad road, deep woods, not many wander here for
 pleasure.
Far off I see the moon-toad, shining, shining, bright.
Just here, I hear a flock of birds, all talking of the
 autumn.
The old man sits, perched on a high green ridge,
living alone in this little mansion, in charge of his
 hair growing white.
Itâ€™s sad, yes, the way the years move on, and today,
heartless, they're going home,
endless, the eastward-flowing stream.
