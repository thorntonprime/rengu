There is a prayer which may be performed at all times and in all places,
which by nothing can be interrupted but by sin and unfaithfulness. ... This
incessant prayer now consists in an everlasting inclination of the heart to
God, which inclination flows from Love. This love draws the presence of God
into us; so that, as by the operation of divine grace the love to God is
generated in us, so is also the presence of grace increased by this love,
that such prayer is performed in us, without us or our cogitation. It is
the same as with a person living in the air and drawing it in with his
breath without thinking that by it he lives and breathes, because he does
not reflect upon it. Wherefore this way is called a Mystical Way-that is,
a secret and incomprehensible way. In one word, the prayer of the heart may
be performed at all times, though the heart cannot think or speak at all times.
