Title: If the Confident Animal
---
If the confident animal coming toward us
had a mind like ours,
the change in him would startle us.
But to him his own being is endless,
undefined, and without regard
for his conditionï¼š clear,
like his eyes. Where we see future,
he sees all, and himself
in all, made whole for always.
