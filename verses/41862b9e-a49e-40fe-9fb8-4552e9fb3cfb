Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king. ... Now at
first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no great regard,
because he had been a man of the people and was of no distinguished
family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by wisdom and not
wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which he had, there was
a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and all his guests were
wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up, and of it he caused to
be made the image of a god, and set it up in the city, where it was most
convenient, and the Egyptians went continually to visit the image and did
great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having learnt that which was done by
the men of the city, called together the Egyptians and made known to them
the matter, saying that the image had been produced from the foot-basin,
into which formerly the Egyptians used to vomit and make water, and in
which they washed their feet, whereas now they did to it great reverence;
and just so, he continued, had he himself now fared, as the foot-basin; for
though formerly he was a man of the people, yet now he was their king, and
he bade them accordingly honor him and have regard for him. In such manner
he won the Egyptians to himself, so that they consented to be his subjects.
