Title: The Cat Koan
By: Suigan Bunchu
Commentary: |
  For this well-known koan. Suigan creates almost the entire composition,
  including the inscription, in gray ink, with black appearing only at the
  areas of most intense focus. These are the face of the Zen masten the cat
  itself, and the knife, although there is also a very dark gray at the foot
  of the figure to anchor the composition. Are we dismayed at the fierce look
  of the master and the innocent look of the cat?
Format: verse

In his right hand he holds the knife
In his left hand, the cat --
  Speak! Speak!
Quick as a flash, it's already too late.
