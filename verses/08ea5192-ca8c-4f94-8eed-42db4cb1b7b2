A man wandering in the sun retires to the shade of a tree and enjoys the cool
atmosphere there. But after a time he is tempted to go into the hot sun. Again
finding the heat unbearable, he returns to the shade. Incessantly he thus moves
to and fro, from the shade into the sun and from the sun into the shade. Such a
man, we say, is ignorant. A wise man would not quit the shade.
