There is a saying among soldiersï¼š
It is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.

In this manner one may deploy troops without marshaling them,
Bring weapons to bear without exposing them,
Engage the foe without invading them,
And exhaust their strength without fighting them.

There is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;
To do so endangers all of my treasures;
So when two well matched forces oppose each other,
The general who maintains compassion will win.
