In one soul we may be entertained and taken up with innumerable beauties. But
in the Soul of Man there are innumerable infinities. One soul in the immensity
of its intelligence, is greater and more excellent than the whole world. The
Ocean is but the drop of a bucket to it, the Heavens but a centre, the Sun
obscurity, and all Ages but as one day. It being by its understanding a
Temple of Eternity, and Godâ€™s omnipresence, between which and the whole
world there is no proportion.
