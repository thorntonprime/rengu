Title: Your Letter
---
Your letter has come, they said, so I left my hoe in the flowerbed
  and tore the letter open.
Though the hand was fine and the lines long, it said little.
Your letter would have said more with even fewer lines.

Your letter has come, they said, so I laid aside my needlework
  and tore the letter open.
Though it asked after me, it didn’t say when you’d come.
Your letter would have told your arrival, even without pleasantries.

Your letter has come, they said, so I stopped infusing my herbs
  and tore the letter open.
That letter bore the address of a foreign warship.
Your letter would have stated your departure, even had you remained.
