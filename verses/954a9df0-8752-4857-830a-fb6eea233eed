Title: Give Me Words That Sing
---
Teach me, I pray, to see the small
unnoticed things in my life,

close to my reach and deeper
than my eye alone can teach.

Show me with the steady measure
of a poet's gaze what it means

to seek words that are pleasing
and alive, as the dance is

to those with tired legs and knees.
Give me words that sing

against the darkest nowhere hour,
ones full of enough silence to be

rich in the spin of every now and
alive in the tremble of each here.
