And when thou recitest the Qur’ân, We place between thee and those who
believe not in the Hereafter a hidden barrier;

And We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it,
and in their ears a deafness; and when thou makest mention of thy
Lord alone in the Qur’ân, they turn their backs in aversion.
