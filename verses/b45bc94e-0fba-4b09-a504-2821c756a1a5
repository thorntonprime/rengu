Idolatry is not primarily considered to be a metaphysical error, a question
of ontology. The key question is not what people believe but how they
behave. What constitutes idolatry is usually not the mistaken attribution of
certain qualities to material objects, but the attitude of loyalty that people
adopt toward created realities. ... Idolatry is primarily a way of life, not
a metaphysical worldview ... the Bible appears to consider allegiance most
commonly to be the decisive factor in separating idolatry from true worship.
