Title: Where Once I Sang
---
It gently faded, all I once believed in. But I am glad there is a world that
 seems to go on where I once sang.
All I ever knew is still a part of me, and will be forever.
All I ever knew is like a little mouse living in a tiny hole in a palace I have
 become.
Since God gave me the key to Myself, I know the movements of every limb, fin
 and leaf. I could tell you how many hairs exist on every creature on earth.
Sometimes it, that sweet little rodent, comes out and we look at each other,
and I even talk to that wondrous world where I once lived, as I am doing right
 now.
