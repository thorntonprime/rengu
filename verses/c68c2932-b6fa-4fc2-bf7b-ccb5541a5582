I had three manners of understanding of this light. Charity. The first is
Charity unmade; the second is Charity made; the third is Charity given. Charity
unmade is God; Charity made is our soul in God; Charity given is virtue. And
that is a precious gift of working in which we love God. for Himself; and
ourselves, in God; and that which God loveth. for God.
