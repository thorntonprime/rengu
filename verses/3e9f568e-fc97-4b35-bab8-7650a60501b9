Now they say that the world is unreal. Of what degree of unreality is it? Is it
like that of a son of a barren mother or a flower in the sky, mere words
without any reference to facts?  Whereas the world is a fact and not a mere
word. The answer is that it is a superimposition on the one Reality, like the
appearance of a snake on a coiled rope seen in dim light.
