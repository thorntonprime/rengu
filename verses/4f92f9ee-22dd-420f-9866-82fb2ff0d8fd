Ranges, ridges, daunting cliffs, I chose this place
 with divination's aid.
The road's for the birds, no man tracks there.
And what is the yard? White clouds clothe
dark stone. I lived here years, watching
springs with The Great Change become winter.
Here's a word for the rich folks with cauldrons and
 bellsï¼š
Fame's empty, no good, that's for sure.
