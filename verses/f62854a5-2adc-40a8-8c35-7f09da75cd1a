Title: I Opened Myself
Description: March 13
Format: Verse
---
I opened myself too wide. I forgot
there's more outside than things and animals
at ease with themselves, whose eyes reflect
the wholeness of their lives.
I forgot my habit of grasping every look
that fell on meï¼š looks, opinions, scrutiny.
