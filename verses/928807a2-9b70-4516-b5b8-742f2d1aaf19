\‘And thy presses shall run over with wine.’ That is, thine inward ghostly
wits, the which thou art wont to strain and press together by divers curious
meditations and reasonable investigations about the ghostly knowing of God and
of thyself, in beholding of his qualities and of thine, shall run over with
wine. By the which wine in Holy Scripture is verily and mistily understood
ghostly wisdom in very contemplation and high savour of the Godhead.
