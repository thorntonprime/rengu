Though this age of Kali is full of vices it possesses one great virtue th at
during this period, through mere chanting of the Divine Name one can obtain
release from bondage and realize God. That which was attained through m
editation in Satyayuga, through perform ance of sacrifices in Tretayuga and
through personal service and worship of God in Dwaparayuga can be obtained
in Kaliyuga through mere chanting of Sri Hariâ€™s Name.
