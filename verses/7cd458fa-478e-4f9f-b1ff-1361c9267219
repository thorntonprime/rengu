Exterminate learning, and there will no longer be worries.

The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest
 in the world;
That which is without substance entering that which has no crevices.

That is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.
The teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action,
 these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.
