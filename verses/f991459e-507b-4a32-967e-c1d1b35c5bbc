Title: To Kiss It All Good-bye
---
Vigil of Pentecost, What do I look for tomorrow? Light? No, It is safer
to travel in darkness, What I need is the grace to cease making any kind
of fuss over anything： travel in darkness and do God‘s will, He will
get me through the obstacles, I will never reach Him by my own efforts,
my own wisdom, I give up all my plans, as if I had any in the first place,
Forget what other people do; their virtues and their faults are none of
my business, Be guided by obedience even if it seems to lead to the ruin
of my aspirations, Easier to write it than to do it, I wonder If I mean
it, too, to go on in this hopeless muddle of writing and activities and
contacts with the world, and trust that that can bring me to God? Yes,
that is what I have got to do.

It seems like going around in a circle and saying the same thing over
and over again, but it is something that haunts me, and I cant seem to
settle it.

I feel in my bones, that I will never have any peace until I kiss everything
good-bye, even my highest ideals and aspirations, God only tolerates one
desire： perfectly doing His will and being annihilated for His glory.
