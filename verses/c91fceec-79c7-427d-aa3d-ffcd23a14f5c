I suppose that in some way I have been going through a small spiritual
crisis. Nothing new, only the usual crisis and struggle, a little more
intensified by the “fiftieth year.” Still it is getting to be quite
decisive because there are fewer evasions possible. As I go on, the ways
of escape are progressively closed, renounced, or otherwise abandoned. I
know now that I am really committed to stability here, and that even the
thought of temporary travel is useless and vain. I know that my contacts
with others of like mind by mail, etc., are relatively meaningless,
though they may have some raison d ’e‘tre. I know that my writing
solves nothing for me personally and that it has created some problems
which are still unresolvedl know there is nothing to be solved or settled
by any special arrangement within the framework of the community. That
my position is definitely ambiguous and myjob is to accept this with the
smallest possible amount of bad faith.

Reading the little book by Eberhard Arnold on the Bruderhof. I think this
(from his statement on his fiftieth birthday) applies well enough to be
almost a word of God to me： “Let us pledge to him that all our own
power will remain dismantled and will keep on being dismantled among
us. Let us pledge that the only thing that will count among us will be
the power and authority of God in jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit;
that it will never again be us that count but that God above will rule
and govern in Christ and the Holy Spirit.”
