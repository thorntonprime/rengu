    Title: No Man Is an Island
By: Thomas Merton

Only the man who has had to face despair is really convinced that he needs
mercy. Those who do not want mercy never seek it. It is better to find God
on the threshold of despair than to risk our lives in a complacency that
has never felt the need of forgiveness. A life that is without problems
may literally be more hopeless than one that always verges on despair.
