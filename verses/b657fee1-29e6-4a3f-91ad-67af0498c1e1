Title: A Nation of Fetishes
---
The great sin, the source of all other sins, is idolatry. And never
has it been greater, more prevalent, than now. It is almost completely
unrecognized -- precisely because it is so overwhelming, total. It
takes in everything. There is nothing else left. Fetishism of power,
machines, possessions, medicine, sports, clothes, etc., all kept going
by greed for money and power. The Bomb is only one accidental aspect of
the cult. Indeed, the Bomb is not the worst. We should be thankful for it
as a sign, a revelation of what all the rest of our civilization points
to： the self-immolation of man to his own greed and his own despair. And
behind it all are the principalities and powers whom man serves in his
idolatry. Christians are as deeply involved in this as everyone else.

This is clearly one of the most important and inescapable messages
of the Bible： that unless man turns from his idols to God, he will
destroy himself, or rather this idolatry will prove itself to be his
destruction. (The idolater is already self-destroyed.) The other thing：
man as a whole will not change. He will destroy himself. The Bible sees no
other end to the story, But Christ has come to save from this destruction
all who seek to be saved. In and through them He will recreate the world. By
no means are we to interpret this to mean that enlightened ethics and
polite good intentions are going to make technological society safe for
man, and that the new creation will be in fact the technological paradise
(plus a renewed liturgy!).
