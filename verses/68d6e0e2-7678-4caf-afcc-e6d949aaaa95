Eliminate learning： and there’s no worry.
Between ‘yes’ and ‘no’, what’s the difference?
What separates ‘good’ and ‘bad’?
But one must respect what others respect.
The people are happy
As if at a marvellous feast,
Or going on a spring outing,
Only I am unmoved and silent,
Abandoned to disorder without limit.
Like a baby that’s not yet smiled,
Aimless, like one of the homeless.
The people have all they want,
It’s only me that’s in need,
My mind’s ignorant – so dull!
Yet the crowd are clear-minded,
It’s only me that’s muddled.
Yet the crowd are all-knowing,
Only from me it’s hidden.
Levelled flat like the ocean,
Like an endless wind blowing.
Everyone has a purpose.
It’s only me that’s raw and foolish.
I’m different from the others.
I like being fed by the Mother!
