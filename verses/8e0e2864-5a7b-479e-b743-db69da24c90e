Through the practice of dhyana or japa the mind becomes one-pointed. Just
as the elephantâ€™s trunk, which is otherwise restless, will become steady
if it is made to hold an iron chain, -- so that the elephant goes its way
without reaching out for any other object, -- even so the ever-restless mind,
which is trained and accustomed to a Name or Form through dhyana or japa,
will steadily hold on to that alone.
