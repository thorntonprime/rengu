Title: Gods' Unending Now
---
To say as many do that God made the world
is to confuse what is true, for God never ceased

making what was made, and what will be
is already present in God's unending Now.

This truth reminds me that God is making
all things new, even what is past and gone

and also what lies yet unknown in the future --
    in your life and mine.
