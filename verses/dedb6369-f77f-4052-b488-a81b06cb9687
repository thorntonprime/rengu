Commentary: In Vedantic terminology. Reality is not complete unless all
  of its three poles -- Being, Knowledge, Bliss, (Sal-Chit-Ã€nanda) --
  are present.

Let not him who desires this knowledge for the purpose of procuring wealth-
and pleasure think that he will ever attain to it. Therefore, let your mind
and thoughts be turned away from all things earthly, and, as it were, created
anew, and consecrated to God alone. For you should observe that these three,
body, soul, and spirit, must work together in harmony if you are to bring
your study of this Art to a prosperous issue, for unless the mind and heart
of a man be governed by the same law which develops the whole work, such an
one must indubitably err in the Art.
