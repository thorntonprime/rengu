When your Source of supply, both spiritual and temporal, is the Infinite
Spirit, your supply is unlimited and inexhaustible： it can never fail. When
you realize this great truth, everything becomes changed： you look upon
life with different eyes. You can say joyfully： “The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want,” accepting the literal meaning of the words.
