I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint： my
heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my
jaws; and thou has brought me into the dust of death. ...

Let my prayer come before thee： incline thine ear unto my cry;

For my soul is full of troubles： and my life draweth nigh unto the
grave.

I am counted with them that go down into the pit： I am as a man that
hath no strength：

Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou
rememberest no more： and they are cut off from thy hand.

Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy
waves.

Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an
abomination unto them： I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction： Lord, I have called daily
upon thee. I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the deaa rise and praise
thee?

Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness
in destruction?
