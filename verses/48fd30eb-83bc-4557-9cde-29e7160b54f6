Long ago, many attained oneness.
Heaven became pure.
Earth became firm.
Spirits became endowed.
Waterways became full.
Men became guides.

Now
without clarity, heaven would collapse.
Without firmness, earth would burst.
Without power, spirits would wane.
Without fullness, valleys would run dry.
Without guidance, communities would dissolve.

Greatness springs from a humble font.
Towers spring from modest foundations.
Thus true leaders profess their lowly roots
and postures to serve.

Too much renown will lead to ruin.
Thus glisten not like polished jade.
Be solid like unhewn rock.
