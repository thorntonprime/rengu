Title: Your Touch
---
Your love is hotter than flames that melt steel, but your touch
 is unbelievably cold.
I’ve known all kinds of coldness in this world, but nothing
 like your touch.
Your touch is colder than the fall wind scattering leaves
 on a frosty morning when chrysanthemums are in bloom.
Your touch is colder than the snow piled
 on ice on a keenly bright wm'ter’s night.
Your touch is colder than the monk’s sermon, cool as sweet dew.

Without your touch, the flames that burn in me cannot end.
My heart is the only measure of the warmth of your touch.
Your love is hot enough to burn a mountain of cares
 and to dry up a sea of regrets,
but your touch is cold beyond measure.
