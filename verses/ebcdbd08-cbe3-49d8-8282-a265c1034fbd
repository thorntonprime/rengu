God summoned me before Him and said： ‘With what comest thou unto Me?’

‘With renunciation of the world.’

‘The world for Me is only the wing of an insect. It is no great thing to
renounce it.’

‘I ask Thy pardon! I come with the abandonment of all self-pursuit.’

‘Am I not guarantee for what I have promised?’

‘I ask Thy pardon! I come with Thyself.’

‘It is in this way that We receive thee.’
