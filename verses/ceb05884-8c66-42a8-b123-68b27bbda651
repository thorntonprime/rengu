Title: Bodhisattvas Enter the Bath
---
In ancient times there were 16 bodhisattvas. At the time
for monks to bathe they followed the custom and entered the bath, and
suddenly awoke by the primary cause of water.

All you Virtuous Ones of Zen, how do you make it alive
to comprehend them saying, The wonderful touch proclaims the
brilliance and becomes the abode of the Buddhas children.

Also, must do eight holes in seven borings to
begin to get it.

Xuedou's ode says
