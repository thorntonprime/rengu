Every thing as it lieth in the whole piece, beareth its part in the Universal
Consort. The Divine Musick of the whole would be changed into Confusion and
Discords, All the sweet proportions of all the parts would be disordered, and
become disagreeable, if any one, the least, and least considered part, were
taken out of the whole. Every part is tyed to the whole, and to all the other
parts, by mutual and essential Relations. By virtue of these Relations, All the
distinct proportions, of all the parts, and of the whole, meet in one, on each
part, filling it with, and wrapping it up in the rich Garment of the Universal
Harmony, curiously wrought, with all the distinct and particular Harmonies.
