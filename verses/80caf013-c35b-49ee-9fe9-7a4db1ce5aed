Title: The Tender Mouth of the Earth
---
What will the burial of my body be? The
pouring of a sacred cup of wine into the earth's

tender mouth and making my dear sweet lover
laugh one more time.

What is the passing of a body? The glorious
lifting of the spirit into the sacred arms of the

Sky, and making existence smile, one more, one
more time.
