Lord, mine eye offended
So I plucked it out.
Imagine my chagrin

When the offence continued.
So I plucked out
The other, but

The offence continued.
In the dark now, and
Working by touch, I shaved

My head, The offence continued.
Removed an ear,
Another, dispatched the nose,

The offence continued.
Imagine my chagrin.
Next, in long strips, the skin-~

Razored the tongue, the toes,
The personal nitty-gritty.
The offence continued.

But now, the thing
Finding its own momentum,
The more so since

The offence continued,
I entered upon
A prolonged course

Of lobotomy and vivisection.
Reducing the self
To a rubble of organs,

A wreckage of bones
In the midst of which, somewhere,
The offence continued.

Quicklime, then, for the
Calcium, paraquat
For the unregenerate offal,

A spreading of topsoil,
A ploughing of this
And a sowing ofit with barley.

Paraffin for the records
Of birth, flu
And abortive scholarship.

For the whimsical postcards,
The cheques
Dancing like hail,

The surviving copies
Of poems published
And unpublished, A scalpel

For the casual turns
Of phrase engraved
On the minds of others.

A chemical spray
For the stray
Thoughts hanging in the air,

For the people
Who breathed them in.
Sadly, therefore, deletion

Of the many people
From their desks, beds,
Breakfasts, buses,

Tandems and catamarans.
Deletion of their
Machinery and architecture,

All evidence whatever
Of civility and reflection
Oflaughter and tears.

Destruction of all things on which
That reflection fed,
Of vegetable and bird,

Erosion ofall rocks
From the holiest mountain
To the least stone,

Evaporation ofall seas,
The extinction of heavenly bodies --
Until, at last, offence

Was not to be found
In that silence without bound.
Only then was I fit for human society.
