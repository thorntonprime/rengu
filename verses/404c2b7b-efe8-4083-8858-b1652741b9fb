The sublimation of the Mercury which is here referred to. is not an artificial,
but a true and natural one. It is the ‘first preparation of the thin
substance’, by which the eclipse caused by the interposition of Earth is
removed from the Moon, enabling her to receive the light of the Sun -- which
happens when the murky sphere of Saturn (that overshadowed the whole horizon)
is removed, and Jupiter ascends the throne; then there rises upward a mist of
dazzling whiteness, whence there is distilled upon the earth a pure, sweet, and
fragrant dew.
