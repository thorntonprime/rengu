When there occurs some errancy in the theurgic technique, the Images
which ought to be at the Autopsia are not, but others of a different
kind. These, the inferiors, assume the guise of the more venerable
orders, and pretend to be the very ones which they are counterfeiting,
and there will be a great mass of falsehood flow forth from the
perversion. ... Do we not know that all things which are brought into
view by such a mode ... are really phantoms of what is genuine, and
that they appear good to the seeing, but never are really so?
