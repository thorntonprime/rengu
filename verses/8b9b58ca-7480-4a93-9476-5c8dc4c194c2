The mystery of speech and silence is resolved in the Acts of the
Apostles. Pentecost is the solution.The problem of language is the problem
of sin. The problem of silence is also a problem of love. How can a man
really know whether to write or not, whether to speak or not, whether
his words and his silence are for good or for ev1l, for life or for death,
unless he understands the two divisions of tongues -- the division of Babel,
when men were scattered in their speech because of pride, and the division
of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost sent out men of one dialect to speak all
the languages of the earth and bring all men to unityï¼š that they may be
one, Father,Thou in Me and I in them, that they may be one in Us.

The Acts of the Apostles is a book full of speech. It begins with tongues
of fire. The Apostles and disciples come downstairs and out into the street
like an avalanche, talking in every language. And the world thought they
were drunk. But before the sun had set, they had baptized three thousand
souls out of Babel into the One Body of Christ. At Pentecost we sing
ofWhom they spoke. The false Jerusalem, the old one that was a figure
and had died, could not prohibit them from speaking (Acts 4). But the
more they loved one another and loved God, the more they declared His
word. And He manifested Himself through them.That is the only possible
reason for speaking -- it justified speaking without end, as long as the
speech formed is from Silence and brings your soul again to silence.
