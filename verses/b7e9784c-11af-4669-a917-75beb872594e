His family name, Most-Arrogant Slave-at-Heart,
first name's Luster, middle name's Liar.
Not a speck of understanding in this thing,
and no work in the world he'll be honest at ...
Death he fears like a bitter herb;
life he gobbles like honey.
Eats fish, lusts after it, and worse,
there's no dog at a bone like him
on the flesh of a sentient being.
