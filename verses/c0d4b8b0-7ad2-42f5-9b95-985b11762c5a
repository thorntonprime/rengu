This earth is the largest thing we see around us. But larger than the earth
is the ocean, and larger than the ocean is the sky. But Vishnu ... has
covered earth, sky, and the nether world with one of His feet. And that foot
of Vishnu is enshrined in the sâdhu’s heart. Therefore the heart of a
holy man is the greatest of all.
