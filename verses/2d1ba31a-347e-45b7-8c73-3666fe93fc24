Ku K’ai-chih’s brush stroke was tight and strong, connecting and continuous,
moving as in a circle exceedingly swift, accomplishing the design with freedom
and ease. It was like a gust of wind or a flash of lightning. The ideas existed
before he took up the brush; when the picture was finished it contained them
all, and thus it was filled with a divine spirit.
