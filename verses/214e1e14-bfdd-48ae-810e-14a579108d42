There is a madness which is a divine gift, and the source of the chiefest
blessings granted to men. For prophecy is a madness, and the prophetess at
Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when out of their senses have conferred
great benefits on Hellas, both in public and private life, but when in their
senses few or none.
