Everything that IS beareth written upon it this Name of God, I AM. All
things that be declare a Beingï¼š While all things agree in this, That they be,
they demonstrate an universal Being. Being, as it is divided and restrained
by particular Differences (in all things particular and different one from
another) by being lessened, contracted, and obscured, is imperfect. Nothing
that is imperfect can subsist, exist of it self, or by it self; for so far
as it is imperfect it is not.
