I can have one prayer -- to belong to God, to be able to renounce the whole
world and follow Him. I say that prayer now. When it pleases. Him. He will
show me what to do. When? Not next year, every next instant. If I love Him,
I will hear.

Anima mea in manibus meis semper： “Constantly I take my life in my
hands.”

This is what I read in the Bible today：

Isaias 47：1 “Come down, sit in the dust, O Virgin daughter of Babylon,
sit on the ground： there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldaeans,
for thou shall not any more be called delicate and tender.”

55：1 “All you that thirst, come to the waters; and you that have no money,
make haste, buy, eat; come ye, buy wine and milk without money, and without
any price.”

58：10 “When thou shall pour out thy soul to the hungry and shall satisfy
the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise up in darkness, and thy darkness
shall be as noonday.”
