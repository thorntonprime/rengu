Commentary: |
  The four states mentioned retrace inversely the successive stages of
  manifestation from Principle (cf. Guénon： Man and His Becoming).

  A skillful Hindu musician, in giving full development to the potentialities
  of a raga, can convey through a kind of 'musical yoga" this fourfold
  withdrawal of sound from manifestation towards Principle, where the
  performance culminates precisely in something very like a sea of
  undifferentiated sound.

Sound exists in four fundamental states, viz. (1) Vaikhari or dense,
audible sound, sound in its maximum differentiation; (2) Madhyama or an
inner, subtle, more ethereal state at which it is inaudible to physical ear;
(3) Pashyanti, a still higher, inner, more ethereal state; (4) Para which
represents Ishwara-Sakti and is the potential (Karana) state of the sound which
is Avyakta or undifferentiated. The Para sound is not, like the Vaikhari,
different in different languages. It is the unchanging primal substratum of
them all, the source of the universe.
