Let us set before our minds the scriptural rule that in speaking about God we
should declare the Truth, not with enticing words of manâ€™s wisdom, but in
demonstration of the power which the Spirit stirred up in the Sacred Writers,
whereby, in a manner surpassing speech and knowledge, we embrace those truths
which, in like manner, surpass them, in that Union which exceeds our faculty,
and exercise of discursive, and of intuitive reason. We must not then dare
to speak, or indeed to form any conception, of the hidden super-essential
Godhead, except those things that are revealed to us from the Holy Scriptures.
