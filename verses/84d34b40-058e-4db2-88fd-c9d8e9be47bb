\‘O Arjuna, I am in the expanse of the Heart.’ says Sri Krishna. ‘He who
is in the Sun, is also in this man,’ says a mantra in the Upanishads. ‘The
Kingdom of God is within,’ says the Bible. All are thus agreed that God is
within. What is to be brought down? From where? Who is to bring what, and why?

Realization is only the removal of obstacles to the recognition of the eternal,
immanent Reality. Reality is. It need not be taken from place to place.
