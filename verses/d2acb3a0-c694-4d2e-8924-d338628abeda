Chiang-lu Mien went to see Chi Ch'e and said, "The ruler of Lu begged
me to give him some instruction. I declined, but he wouldn't let me go
and so I had no choice but to tell him something. I don't know whether
what I said was right or not, but I would like to try repeating it to
you. I said to the ruler of Lu, 'You must be courteous and temperate!
Pick out and promote those who are loyal and public-spirited, allow no
flattery or favoritism, and then who of your people will venture to be
unruly?' "
