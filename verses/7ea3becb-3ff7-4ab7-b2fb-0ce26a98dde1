Title: Webbed Toes
---
Two TOES WEBBED TOGETHER, a sixth finger forking off - these come from
the inborn nature but are excretions as far as Virtue is concerned.
Swelling tumors and protruding wens - these come from the body but are
excretions as far as the inborn nature is concerned. Men overnice in
the ways of benevolence and righteousness try to put these into
practice, even to line them up with the five vital organs!
