Sen no Rikyu, a tea-master, wished to hang a flower basket on a
column. he asked a carpenter to help him, directing the man to
place it a little higher or lower, to the right or left, until
he had found exactly the right spot. "That's the place," said
Sen no Rikyu finally.

The carpenter, to test the master, marked the spot and then
pretended he had forgotten. Was this the place? "Was this the
place, perhaps?" the carpenter kept asking, pointing to various
places on the column.

But so accurate was the tea-master's sense of proportion that it
was not until the carpenter reached the identical spot again
that its location was approved.
