Surrendering the old selfto make way for the new is not easy; it requires
relinquishing our power, our expectations, and our independence to
make way for humility, guidance, awareness, consciousness, grace,
and simplicity. Although we are sometimes forced to surrender through
suffering and illness, conscious surrender to the greater good can be a
celebration of belonging to God. To live in a state of surrender is to
let go of our concept of time, of form, ofa beginning, middle, and end of
the course oflife and to live solely in the present. It is about believing
that everything continues as it is meant to be in every moment. One of my
favourite Buddhist sayings aptly describes this： “When in doubt about
where you are meant to be, look down at your feet.”
