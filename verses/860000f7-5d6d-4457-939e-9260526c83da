What is well rooted will not topple.
What is well embraced will not escape.
What is well remembered will not fade
as generations pass.

Cultivated in the self, integrity affirms.
Cultivated in the family, integrity enriches.
Cultivated in the village, integrity endures.
Cultivated in the nation, integrity abounds.
Cultivated in the world, integrity pervades.

Understand another as yourself.
Understand a family as a family,
a village as a village,
a nation as a nation.
Understand the world as the world.

How does one understand things so vast?
By what is deep within.
