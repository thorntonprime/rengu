Devote one short hour every day
To serve your Maker and your Lord,
Do worship, meditate or pray
Or sow some seeds of Good abroad.

Do something, in His name, to show
That you are mindful of the debt
Which children to their parents owe
For all the gifts they freely get.

Do something noble, something fine
That has no colour of the self,
No shade of ego, me or mine,
No thought of honour, fame or pelf.

Do something good to benefit
The humble crowds surrounding you,
Whose minds not yet by Wisdom lit
Cannot decide what they should do.
