I am the Tathâgata. O ye gods and men! the Arhat. the perfectly enlightened
one; having reached the shore myself. I carry others to the shore; being free.
I make free; being comforted. I comfort; being perfectly at rest. I lead others
to rest. By my perfect wisdom I know both this world and the next, such as they
really are. I am all-knowing, all-seeing.  Come to me. ye gods and men! hear
the law. I am he who indicates the path; who shows the path, as knowing the
path, being acquainted with the path. ...

I preach with ever the same voice, constantly taking enlightenment as my text.
For this is equal for all; no partiality is in it. neither hatred nor
affection.

I am inexorable, bear no love nor hatred towards any one. and proclaim the law
to all creatures without distinction, to the one as well as the other. ...

I re-create the whole world like a cloud shedding its water without
distinction; I have the same feelings for respectable people as for the low;
for moral persons as for the immoral; for the depraved as for those who observe
the rules of good conduct;

For those who hold sectarian views and unsound tenets as for those whose views
are sound and correct.

I preach the law to the inferior in mental culture as well as to persons of
superior understanding and extraordinary faculties; inaccessible to weariness.
I spread in season the rain of the law. ...

As the rays of the sun and moon descend alike on all men, good and bad. without
deficiency in one case or surplus in the other;

So the wisdom of the Tathâgata shines like the sun and moon, leading all beings
without partiality.
