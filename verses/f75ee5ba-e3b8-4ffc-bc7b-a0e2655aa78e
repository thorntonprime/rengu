All rivers, large or small, clear or muddy, flow into the ocean and the
ocean responds by yielding vapors that become clouds which rain and fill
the rivers. That is the cycle.

The saints show love and respect to all people, rich or poor, good or bad.
The people, seeing such exquisite fairness, respond venerating the saints
and trying to emulate them. This, too, is a cycle.

Regard the Dharma as a river regards the ocean, the source of its very
nature and its endlessly renewing destiny. Regard the Dharma as saints
regard the people, the object of love and the reward for loving.
