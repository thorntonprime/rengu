Title: Love That Forgets It Was Born in Sorrow
---
My soul is trying to awaken and discover again the beauty of penance. I am
ashamed of having made so many confessions of my faults in the monastery
with so little sorrow and so feeble a hope of doing better. I want to say,
over and over again, that I am sorry. I do not know how I can go on living
unless I convince you,]esus, that I am really sorry.The psalms say this
better than I ever could. I am sorry that it has taken me so long to begin
to discover the psalms. I am sorry that I have not lived them.

I am sorry for having let myself become so stupid and so torpid,
thinking more of myself than of what I owe to your Love -- and I owe You
everything. Forgive me for paying so little attention.Without compunction
and deep sorrow, contemplation is likely to be nothing more than a kind
of idolatry. How can I love You if I do not know who I am and who You
are? And how can I know this without sorrow? jesus, I no longer want to
have anything to do with love that forgets that it was born in sorrow,
and therefore forgets to be grateful. Otherwise I will only go on lying
to You, and I want to be done with insincerity forever and forever.
