Title: Complete Understanding
By: Inzan Ien
Commentary: |
  Inzan has written three characters： ryo (了) ryo (了) and chi (), with
  the middle character represented by a clot that acts as a repeat mark. Ryo
  means “complete” and also “finally,” while chi means “knowing”
  or “understanding,” and so another possible translation of the three
  characters might be： “finally, finally understanding." The opening
  ryo balances its strong fuzzing horizontal at the top with a long curving
  stroke downwards, ending with a touch of “flying white.“ This character
  occupies almost half the scroll, and also seems to give birth to the single
  dot below it, a repeat mark, which shows traces of how the brush began it
  from the upper left. It exactly divides the first from the third character,
  and yet it also relates to the lower dot to give a sense of continuity The
  lower dot, however, has a slightly different and more stable shape, nicely
  dividing the spaces around it. Chi is also a marvel ofbalance as it swings
  from upper left up again to the right, moves down with an angular zigzag
  to the lower left‘ and finally curves around and back to the right. It
  is so secure in space that one might imagine a floor below it, but there is
  nothing but empty paper; Inzan does not complicate matters with a signature
  but merely adds three seals. Is this work dance or architecture? Certainly
  both, and much more, which can be left for each viewer to discover.
