Title: The Lord of Slaughter
Commentary: |
  To Lao Tzu, not to fear dying and not to fear killing are equally unnatural
  and antisocial. Who are we to forestall the judgment of heaven or nature,
  to usurp the role of “the executioner”? “The Lord of Slaughter” is
  Waley’s grand translation.

When normal, decent people don’t fear death,
how can you use death to frighten them?
Even when they have a normal fear of death,
who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn’t?
When people are normal and decent and death-fearing,
there’s always an executioner.
To take the place of that executioner
is to take the place of the great carpenter.
People who cut the great carpenter’s wood
seldom get off with their hands unhurt.
