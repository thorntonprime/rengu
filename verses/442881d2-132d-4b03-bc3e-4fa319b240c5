---
When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to
 ploughing in the fields;
When the way does not prevail in the empire, war-horses breed on the
 border.

There is no crime greater than having too many desires;
There is no disaster greater than not being content;
There is no misfortune greater than being covetous.

Hence in being content, one will always have enough.
