O centre of the compass! O inmost ground of the truth! O pivot of necessity
and contingency!

O eye of the entire circle of existence! O point of the Koran and the Furqân!

O perfect one, and perfecter of the most perfect, who have been beautified
by the majesty of God the Merciful!

Thou art the Pole (Qutb) of the most wondrous things. The sphere of perfection
in its solitude turns on thee.

Thou art transcendent; nay, thou art immanent; nay, thine is all that is
known and unknown, everlasting and perishable.

Thine in reality is Being and not-being; nadir and zenith are thy two garments.

Thou art both the light and its opposite; nay, but thou art only darkness
to a gnostic that is dazed.
