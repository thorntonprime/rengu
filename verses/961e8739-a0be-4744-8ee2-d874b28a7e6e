To do one’s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be
justice. ... But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature
designed to be a trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or
strength or the number of his followers, or any like advantage,
attempts to force his way into the class of warriors, or a warrior
into that of legislators and guardians, for which he is unfitted, and
either to take the implements or the duties of the other; or when one
man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in one, then I think you
will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling
of one with another is the ruin of the State.
