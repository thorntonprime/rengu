There's one sort of dolt in this world,
lost, lost, with the heart of an ass.
Although he maybe can talk like a human,
for lust and for greed he's a pig's equal ...
Dangerous, crooked, and so hard to figure ...
He sounds real smooth, but it's always a lie.
If you can bear to have words with this creature,
tell him, "You can't stay here!"
