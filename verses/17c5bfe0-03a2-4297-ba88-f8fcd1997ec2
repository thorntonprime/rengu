You must want like a God that you may be satisfied like God. ... He is
infinitely Glorious, because all His wants and supplies are at the same time
in his nature from Eternity. ... His wants are as lively as His enjoyments;
and always present with Him. For His life is perfect, and He feels them
both. His wants put a lustre upon His enjoyments and make them infinite. His
enjoyments being infinite crown His wants, and make them beautiful even to
God Himself. His wants and enjoyments being always present are delightful to
each other, stable, immutable, perfective of each other, and delightful to
Him. Who being Eternal and Immutable, enjoyeth all His wants and treasures
together. His wants never afflict Him, His treasures never disturb Him. His
wants always delight Him; His treasures never cloy Him.
