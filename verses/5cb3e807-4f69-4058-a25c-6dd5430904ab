The Master said  The Way covers and bears up the ten thousand things
- vast, vast is its greatness! The gentleman must pluck out his mind!
To act through inaction is called Heaven. To speak through inaction is
called Virtue. To love men and bring profit to things is called
benevolence. To make the unlike alike is called magnitude. To move
beyond barrier and distinction is called liberality. To possess the ten
thousand unlikes is called wealth. To hold fast to Virtue is called
enrootment. To mature in Virtue is called establishment. To follow the
Way is called completion. To see that external things do not blunt the
will is called perfection. When the gentleman clearly comprehends these
ten things, then how huge will be the greatness of his mind setting
forth, how endless his ramblings with the ten thousand things!
