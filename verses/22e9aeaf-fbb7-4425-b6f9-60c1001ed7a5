Do not be an embodier of fame; do not be a storehouse of schemes; do
not be an undertaker of projects; do not be a proprietor of wisdom.
Embody to the fullest what has no end and wander where there is no
trail. Hold on to all that you have received from Heaven but do not
think you have gotten anything. Be empty, that is all. The Perfect Man
uses his mind like a mirror - going after nothing, welcoming nothing,
responding but not storing. Therefore he can win out over things and
not hurt himself.
