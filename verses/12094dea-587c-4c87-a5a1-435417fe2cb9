Title: Confucius and the Madman
Format: verse
---
When Confucius was visiting the state of Chu,
Along came Kieh Yu
The madman of Chu
And sang outside the Master's door：
  "O Phoenix, Phoenix,
  Where's your virtue gone?
  It cannot reach the future
  Or bring the past again!
  When the world makes sense
  The wise have work to do.
  They can only hide
  When the world's askew.
  Today if you can stay alive
  Lucky are you：
  Try to survive!

  "Joy is feather light
  But who can carry it?
  Sorrow falls like a landslide
  Who can parry it?

  "Never, never
  Teach virtue more.
  You walk in danger,
  Beware! Beware!
  Even ferns can cut your feetWhen
  I walk crazy
  I walk right：
  But am i a man
  To imitate?"

The tree on the mountain height is its own enemy.
The grease that feeds the light devours itself.
The cinnamon tree is edible： so it is cut down!
The lacquer tree is profitable： they maim it.
Every man knows how useful it is to be useful.

No one seems to know
How useful it is to be useless.
