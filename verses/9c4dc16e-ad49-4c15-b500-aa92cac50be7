Title: Of Course Things Like That Can Happen (2)
---
The sun rolls through the sky meadow every day and a billion cells run
to the top of a leaf to scream and applaud and smash things in their
joy.

Of course things like that can happen.

Rivers stay up all night and chant; luminous fish jump out of the
water spitting emeralds at all talk of heaven being anywhere else,
but -- Right Here!

Clouds pull each other's pants down and point and laugh. Oh my dear,
of course things like that can happen. For all is written in the mind
to help and instruct the dervish in dance, romance and prayer.

The stars get a little crazy and drunk at night and throw themselves
across the sky.

Only an insane compound is not going mad with excitement at this
extraordinary performance by God!

And still, light stretches its arms open even more and calls to you
because you are creation's lover, to cease any unforgiving and just
boogie -- O yeah! Look! Angels and flowers are playing hooky in
graveyards, laughing and rolling naked on cool stones.

Why go to sleep tonight, exhausted from fear or want when the Old
King, Himself, is still so jazzed up -- He is doing somersaults and
handstands, and offering useful advanced lessons ... about stuff
between the sky & earth's sheets.

Hell yes, O boy, O girlâ€”indeed things like that can happen.
