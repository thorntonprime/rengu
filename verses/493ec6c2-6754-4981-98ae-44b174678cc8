Title: We Must Abandon God
---
One person said they had God,
while another lamented God's absence.

I say thisï¼š we must abandon the God
we have in our thinking and believing

for God's sake, so that we might come
to know God as God truly is -- who

never left us, beyond knowing, in
a single oneness and pure union.
