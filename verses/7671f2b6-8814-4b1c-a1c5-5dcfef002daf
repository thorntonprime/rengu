The great scholar hearing the Tao Tries to practice it. The middling
 scholar hearing the Tao, Sometimes has it, sometimes not.
The lesser scholar hearing the Tao Has a good laugh. Without that laughter
 It wouldn't be Tao.
Therefore these sayingsï¼š The bright road seems dark, The road forward sees
 to retreat, The level road seems rough.
Great Te seems hollow. Great purity seems sullied. Pervasive Te sees
 deficient. Established Te seems furtive. Simple truths seem to change. The
 great square has no corners. The great vessel is finished late. The great
 sound is scarcely voiced. The great image has no form.
Tao hides, no name. Yet Tao alone gets things done.
