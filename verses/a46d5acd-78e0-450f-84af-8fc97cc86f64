  Title: Dialogues with Silence
---
There is no leaf that is not in Your care. There is no cry that
was no heard by You before it was uttered. There is no water
in the shales that was not hidden there by Your wisdom. There
is no concealed spring that was not concealed by You. There is
no glen for a lone house that was not planned by You for a lone
house. There is no man for that acre of woods that was not
made by You for that acre of woods.
  But there is a greater comfort in the substance of silence
than in the answer to a question. Eternity is in the present.
Eternity is in the palm of the hand. Eternity is a seed of fire
whose sudden roots break barriers that keep my heart from
being an abyss.
