---
When horses live on the plain, they eat grass and drink from the
streams. Pleased, they twine their necks together and rub; angry, they
turn back to back and kick. This is all horses know how to do. But if
you pile poles and yokes on them and line them up in crossbars and
shafts, then they will learn to snap the crossbars, break the yoke, rip
the carriage top, champ the bit, and chew the reins. Thus horses learn
how to commit the worst kinds of mischief. This is the crime of Po Lo.
