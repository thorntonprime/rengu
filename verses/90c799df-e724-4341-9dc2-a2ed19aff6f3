Title: Silent Illumination
---
Your body sits silently;
your mind, quiescent, unmoving.
Your mouth is so still
that moss grows around it.
Grass sprouts from your tongue.
Do this without cease,
cleansing the mind
until it gains the clarity
of an autumn pool,
bright as the moon
illuminating the evening sky.
