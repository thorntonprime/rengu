Title: One Outside the Way Questions Buddha
---
Raisedï¼š

One outside the Way questioned Buddha, "I do not
question with words; I do not question without words."

The World Honored One was respectful a long time.

The one outside the Way said in praise, "The World
Honored One's great compassion and great pity have opened my clouds of
confusion and allowed me to gain entry."

After the one outside the Way departed, Ananda
questioned Buddha, "What did the one outside the Way have in the place
of evidence and accordingly the words 'gaining entry'?"

Buddha said, "Like a fine horse of the world, he sees
the shadow of the whip and goes accordingly."
