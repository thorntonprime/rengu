Death is common in the world. Everyone in it must one day or other doff
the physical part of living. Hence, it is not at all proper to be afraid
of it. ... While the body perishes, the Spirit is immortal. We are here to
realize we are the spirit. Body is only a vesture, a mask, or a vehicle,
impermanent and transitory.
