Title: A good teaching how a man shall flee these deceits, and work more
  with a listiness of spirit, than with any boisterousness of body
---
And therefore for God’s love be wary in this work, and strain not thine heart
in thy breast over-rudely nor out of measure; but work more with a list than
with any worthless strength. For ever the more Mistily, the more meekly and
ghostly： and ever the more rudely, the more bodily and beastly. And therefore
be wary, for surely what beastly heart that presumeth for to touch the high
mount of this work, it shall be beaten away with stones. Stones be hard and
dry in their kind, and they hurt full sore where they hit. And surely such
rude strainings be full hard fastened in fleshliness of bodily feeling, and
full dry from any witting of grace; and they hurt full sore the silly soul,
and make it fester in fantasy feigned of fiends. And therefore be wary with
this beastly rudeness, and learn thee to love listily, with a soft and a demure
behaviour as well in body as in soul; and abide courteously and meekly the
will of our Lord, and snatch not overhastily, as it were a greedy greyhound,
hunger thee never so sore. And, gamingly be it said, I counsel that thou do
that in thee is, refraining the rude and the great stirring of thy spirit,
right as thou on nowise wouldest let Him wit how fain thou wouldest see Him,
and have Him or feel Him.

This is childishly and playingly spoken, thee think peradventure. But I
trow whoso had grace to do and feel as I say, he should feel good gamesome
play with Him, as the father doth with the child, kissing and clipping,
that well were him so
