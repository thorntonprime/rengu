If you want to get at the kernel of something,
you must first break the shell.
Only then can you enjoy its true benefits.
Symbols of reality are not the same as reality itself,
so they must be destroyed.
Then you will come closer and closer
to what truly is.
When you finally reach the One,
there your soul must remain.
