Title: Christ Is My Own Kind
---
In Louisville I bought marvelous books for a few pennies -- including
The Family ofMan for fifty cents.All those fabulous pictures. And again,
no refinements and no explanations are necessary! I-Iow scandalized some
would be if I said that this whole book is to me a picture ofi Christ,
and yet that is the Truth. There, there is Christ in my own Kind, my own
Kind -- Kind, which means “likeness” and which means “love” and
which means “child.” Mankind. Like one another, the dear “Kind” of
sinners united and embraced in only one heart, in only one Kindness, which
is the Heart and Kindness ofChrist. I do not look for sin in you, Mankind. I
do not see sin in you anymore today (though we are all sinners).There is
something too real to allow sin any longer to seem important, to seem to
exist, for it has been swallowed up, it has been destroyed, it is gone,
and there is only the great secret between us that we are all one Kind,
and what matters is not what this or that one has committed in his heart,
separate from the others, but the love that brings him back to all the
others in the one Christ, and this love is not our love but the Divine
Bridegroom’s. It is the Divine Power and the Divine joy -- and God is
seen and reveals Himself as man, that is, in us, and there is no other hope
of finding wisdom than in God-manhood： our own manhood transformed in God!
