By reason of the habit-energy stored up by false imagination since
beginningless time, this world (vishaya) is subject to change and destruction
from moment to moment; it is like a river, a seed, a lamp, wind, a cloud;
(while the Vijnana itself is) like a monkey who is always restless, like a fly
who is ever in search of unclean things and defiled places, like a fire which
is never satisfied. Again, it is like a water-drawing wheel or a machine, it
(i.e. the Vijnana) goes on rolling the wheel of transmigration, carrying
varieties of bodies and forms, resuscitating the dead like the demon Vétala,
causing the wooden figures to move about as a magician moves them. Mahamati. a
thorough understanding concerning these phenomena is called comprehending the
egolessness of persons.
