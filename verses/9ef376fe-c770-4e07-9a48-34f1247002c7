Title: The Way That Moves as You Move
Description: April 25

Some commentary on the quatrainï¼š
As you start on the way, the way appears.
When you cease to be, real being comes.

This is how you slip through
to your non-spatial home.

Think of how you came into this world.
Can you explain how that was? No? The same way
that you came is the way you will leave.

You wander landscapes in your dreams.
How did you get there? Close your eyes and surrender,
and find yourself in the city of God.

But you are still looking for admiration.
You love how your customers look at you.
You love to sit at the head of the assembly.
You close your eyes and see people applauding,
as surely as an owl shuts and sees the forest.

You live in an admiration-world,
but what do you offer your admirers?
If you had true spirit-gifts to give,
you would not think of customers.
