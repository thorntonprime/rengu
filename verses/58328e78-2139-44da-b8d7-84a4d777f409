Title: The Soul Digests
---
Each of us has a soul
made to grasp the One
who made every one,
body and soul.
Slowly and deliberately.
as bodies digest, the soul’s powers
move and nourish us.
As the holy grows‘ the soul’s powers
grow inside us.
As my eyes learn to see,
in light and all detail, the soul
finds its power to think and see.
