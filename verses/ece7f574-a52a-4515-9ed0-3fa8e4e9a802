  - Discernment-Truth=Spiritual Drowning
By: Eckhart
---
To know all things in the cause of their existence I must soar beyond all
lights, temporal and eternal, and plunge into the causeless essence which gives
mind and being to my soul.  Drowned in this being, aware of self and things
merely as being, my soul has lost her name.
