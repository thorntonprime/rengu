Be filled with Te, Like a babyï¼š Wasps, scorpions and vipers Do not sting
 it. Fierce tigers do not stalk it. Birds of prey do not attack it. Bones
 weak, muscles soft, But its grasp is tight.
It does not yet know Union of male and female, But its sex is formed, Its
 vital essence complete.
It can scream all day and not get hoarse, Its harmony is complete. Knowing
 harmony is called endurance. Knowing endurance is called illumination.
Increasing life is called fortune. Mind controlling energy is called power.
When beings prosper and grow old, Call them not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.
