Hui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu, "I have a big tree of the kind men call
shu. Its trunk is too gnarled and bumpy to apply a measuring line to,
its branches too bent and twisty to match up to a compass or square.
You could stand it by the road and no carpenter would look at it twice.
Your words, too, are big and useless, and so everyone alike spurns
them!"
