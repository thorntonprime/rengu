Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name, worship the Lord in the
 beauty of holiness.
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth;
 the Lord is upon many waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars
 of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young
 unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness
 of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests;
 and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory
