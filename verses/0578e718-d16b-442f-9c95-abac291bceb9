The vigour of reason and intelligence is denoted by man, and the mobility of
incorruptible nature by the birds. When, therefore, ‘this corruptible shall
have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality’,
then we, being spiritual in mind and body equally, will ... have power to
be everywhere through the lightness of our incorruptible bodies. Our minds
will fly by contemplation, our bodies will fly on account of incorruption.
