Commentary: All-goodness here in Christian terminology is the exact equivalent
  of the Hindu ternary Sat-Chit-Ánanda.

And I saw no difference between God and our Substance; but as it were all God;
and yet mine understanding took that our Substance is in God; that is to say,
that God is God, and our Substance is a creature in God. ... We are enclosed in
the Father, and we are enclosed in the Son, and we are enclosed in the Holy
Ghost. And the Father is enclosed in us, and the Son is enclosed in us, and the
Holy Ghost is enclosed in us： Almightiness, All-Wisdom, All-Goodness： one
God, one Lord.
