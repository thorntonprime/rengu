Great Te appears Flowing from Tao.
Tao in action - Only vague and intangible. Intangible and vague, But within
 it are images. Vague and intangible; Within are entities. Shadowy and
 obscure; Within there is life, Life so real, That within it there is
 trust.
From the beginning its name is not lost But reappears through multiple
 origins.
How do I know these origins? Like this.
