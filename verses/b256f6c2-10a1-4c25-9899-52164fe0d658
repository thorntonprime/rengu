Lust, or love; some grasp at it for happiness,
but only calamity dwells within the mortal shell,
and thus they march through fire toward a bright
 mirage,
to find all love inconstant; the dying body ...
A real man's one ambition is to be as straight as
 steel.
In the heart that is not twisted,
the Tao's a road that runs straight through.
Close-growing, see the bamboo bend beneath the
 snow,
and know it cannot be in vain to spend the spirit so.
