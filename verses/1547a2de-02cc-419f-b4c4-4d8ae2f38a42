The quality of mercy is not strain’d.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath： it is twice bless’d：
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes：
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown：
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power.
The attribute to awe and majesty.
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptered sway.
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.
It is an attribute to God himself.
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.
