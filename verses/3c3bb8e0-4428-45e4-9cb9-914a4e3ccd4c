Title: The Heavy Artillery
---
Sound said to me, "I want to be holy." And I replied, "Dear, what is the
  problem? You already are."

Then sound quipped back, "What do you mean?"

"Well, the wind speaks, does it not? And what about the refrain of geese? And
  what of the moo and the baa and the rooster at dawn,

and the chorus from the sea and the rain, and the thunder? Is not all a part of
  God, thus sacred?

I think He has surrounded us; we better give up, or He might bring out the
  heavy

artillery ... like just outright lifting His skirt everywhere. Think of the all
  the sweet madness that would cause."
