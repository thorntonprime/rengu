Mokusen Hiki was living in a temple in the province of Tamba.
One of his adherents complained of the stinginess of his wife.

Mokusen visited the adherent's wife and showed her his clenched
fist before her face.

"What do you mean by that?" asked the surprised woman.

"Suppose my fist were always like that. What would you call it?"
he asked.

"Deformed," replied the woman.

Then he opened his hand flat in her face and asked： "Suppose it
were always like that. What then?"

"Another kind of deformity," said the wife.

"If you understand that much," finished Mokusen, "you are a good
wife." Then he left.

After his visit, this wife helped her husband to distribute as
well as to save.
