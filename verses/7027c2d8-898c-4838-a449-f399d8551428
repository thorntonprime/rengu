Title: The Point of Zazen
---
The entire world in ten directions
is just one bright pearl.

The hub of buddhas' activity,
the turning of the ancestors' hub,
moves along with your nonthinking
and is completed in the realm of nonmerging.

As it moves along with your nonthinking
its emergence is immediate.
As it is completed in the realm of nonmerging
completeness itself is realization.

When its emergence is intimate
there is no separateness.
When completeness reveals itself
it is neither real nor apparent.

When there is immediacy without separateness
immediacy is "dropping away" with no obstacle.
Realization, beyond real or apparent,
is effort without desire.

Clear water all the way to the ground;
a fish swims like a fish.
Vast sky's transparent throughout;
a bird flies like a bird.
