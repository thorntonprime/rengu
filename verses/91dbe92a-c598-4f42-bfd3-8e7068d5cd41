Title: The Simple Chat
---
A burning coal against the flesh-who has not felt this, from news that
 reached you,
or the shock to your nerves from bearing eyewitness to horrific events?
The avalanches come, we should help dig each other out.
The simple chat will return. May it last long, and be realized as precious.
