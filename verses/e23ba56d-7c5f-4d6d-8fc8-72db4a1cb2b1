O unfathomable sink, in thy depth thou art high and in thy height profound!—How
so? -- That is hidden from us in thy bottomless abysm. ...

The fastidious soul can rest her understanding on nothing that has name. She
escapes from every name into the nameless nothingness. Escaping her own nature
she falls clear of her own aught. The naught she falls into is the unknowing,
which is called the dark. ...  This darkness is the incomprehensible nature of
God. She sinks for evermore in the depths of this naught. She sinks and drowns;
she drowns to her own aught. Her aught, surviving, sinks as naught to naught.
But the naught that sinks can never comprehend the naught it sinks in. Every
virtue mastered and transcended, the soul cries; ‘Even so I cannot glorify and
love God to the full. I die then to the virtues casting me into the naught of
the Godhead to sink eternally from naught to aught.’
