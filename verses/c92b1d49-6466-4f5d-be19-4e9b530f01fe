We must crush both the interior and exterior enemies of the Republic,
or perish with her. And in this situation, the first maxim of your policy
should be to conduct the people by reason and the enemies of the people
by terror. If the spring of popular government during peace is virtue,
the spring of popular government in rebellion is at once both Virtue
and terror; virtue, without which terror is fatal! terror, without which
virtue is powerless! Terror is nothing else than justice, prompt, secure,
and inflexible! It is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is less a
particular principle than a consequence of the general principles of
democracy, applied to the most urgent want of the country.
