All likeness among things
is born out of the oneness of things
and this likeness
begotten of the One,
and in and of the One,
is the beginning,
the source of that glowing flowerï¼š
Love.

The One itdelf, however,
is a source without beginning,
a source of which all likeness looks to as origin,
and for the fact of its existence and beginning.

Love, on the other hand,
appears only where there are two;
but it turns out to be one and uniform;
for love cannot exist divided.
In love's nature,
two function as one,
and there is ardor, willing, and longing.
