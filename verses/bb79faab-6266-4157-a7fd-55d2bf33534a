That which has a beginning must also end. ... Realisation is not acquisition
of anything new nor is it a new faculty. It is only removal of all
camouflage. ... The ultimate Truth is so simple. It is nothing more than
being in the pristine state. ... Mature minds alone can grasp the simple
Truth in all its nakedness.
