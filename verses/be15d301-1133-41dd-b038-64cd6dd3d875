Title: The Sixth Ancestor Chopping Bamboo
Description: Commentary on Liang Kai's painting
By: John Daido Loori

The Sixth Ancestor was an illiterate layman from the south of China who was
enlightened upon hearing the Diamond Sutra being chanted. He later joined a
monastery, where he was first given the job of chopping wood and pounding
rice, and later received transmission from the Fifth Ancestor when he was
only twenty-four years old. Due to the jealousy of other monks, Huineng was
advised to hide himselfin the mountains and deepen his spirituality. Fifteen
years later he emerged and began teaching. All of the major schools of
Zen can trace their history to the Sixth Ancestor. Since the artist was
a court painter rather than a Zen master, no inscription was included.

One evening, the Fifth Ancestor entered the rice shack to test Huineng's
understanding. He asked. “Is the rice white yet?”

Huineng said, “ It’s white, but it hasn't been sifted.“

The Master struck the mortar three times. Huineng sifted the rice three
times and the dharma was transmitted to the next generation.
