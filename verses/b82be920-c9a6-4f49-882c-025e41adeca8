What impresses me most at reading Shantideva is not only his emphasis
on solitude, but the idea of solitude as part of the clarification which
includes living for others： the dissolution of the self in “belonging
to everyone” and regarding everyone’s suffering as one’s own. This is
really incomprehensible unless one shares something of the deep existential
Buddhist concept of suffering as bound up with the arbitrary formation of
an illusory ego-self. To be “homeless” is to abandon one’s attachment
to a particular ego -- and yet to care for one’s own life (in the highest
sense) in the service of others. A deep and beautiful idea.

“Be you jealous and afraid of your own self when you see that it is at
ease and your fellow is in distress, that it is in high estate and he is
brought low, that it is at rest and he is at labor. Make your own self lose
its pleasures and bear the sorrow of its fellows.”
