The Gnostic is not one who commits to memory passages from the Qur’ân, who if
he forgets what he has learned, becomes ignorant. He only is the Gnostic who
takes his knowledge from His Lord at all times, without having to learn it, and
without studying, and this (knowledge) lasts throughout his life-time, he does
not forget his knowledge, but he remembers it for ever. He has no need of a
book, and he is the (true) spiritual Gnostic.
