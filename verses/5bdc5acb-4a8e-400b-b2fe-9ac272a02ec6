Statesmen have always been eager to accept from the theologian and the
philosopher the correct formulation of the ethical precepts that should guide
foreign policy, and since the seventeenth century all power politics has,
therefore, been presented not as a crude attempt to survive in a tough
world but as a noble endeavor aimed at the establishment of political
equilibrium and the preservation of order.

Formulated in those terms the success has not been overwhelming. We
might search for an explanation in the fact that the process is not
guaranteed and that not all statesmen are good technicians, but it is
per-I haps safer to explain the result on the theory that they were not
really interested in achieving a balance. There are not many instances
in history which show great and powerful states creating alliances and
organizations to limit their own strength. States are always engaged in
curbing the force of some other state. The truth of the matter is that
states are interested only in a balance which is in their favor. Not an
equilibrium, but a generous margin is their objective. There is no real
security in being just as strong as a potential enemy; there is security
only in being a little stronger. There is no possibility of action if
one’s strength is fully checked; there is a chance for a positive
foreign policy only if there is a margin of force which can be freely used.
