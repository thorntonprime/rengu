The discourses spoken by the Tathagata are profound, of profound
significance, dealing with the other world and bound up with the
emptiness of this world. But the time will come when they will no
longer be regarded as things to be studied and mastered： on the
contrary, it is those discourses that are made by poets in the
poetical style, with embellished sounds, overlaid with ornament, and
spoken by profane auditors, that will be considered worthy of study
and the others will disappear.
