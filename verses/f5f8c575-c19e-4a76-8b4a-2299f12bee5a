The more people try to use willpower to obliterate a desire, the more they
strengthen the desire. The additional force only serves to confuse them.
They become obsessed with the problem. The more people talk about the
Dharma without knowing what it is, the more they strengthen their
ignorance. They grow in this ignorance and soon consider themselves towers
of rectitude. They’re like fish out of water who attempt to teach others to
swim, or like caged birds who offer lessons in flying.

If you want to conquer a desire, take off its mask and see it for what it
is. Instantly, it becomes insignificant  --   not worth a second thought. If
you want to discourse on the Dharma, let it become your natural habitat. Be
at home in it. Familiarize yourself with human nature by recognizing your
own errors and base desires. Instantly, you’ll forgive others for their
mistakes. Be humble and gentle in your love for humanity. That’s the way to
set an example for others to copy. Proud rigidity isn’t rectitude. It’s
spiritual rigor mortis.
