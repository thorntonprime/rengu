Commentary: The fire here is equatable to Agni
---
And straightway the Lord of all spoke with his own holy and creative speech,
and said, ‘Let the sun be’; and even as He spoke, Nature drew to herself with
her own breath the fire, which is of upward-tending nature, -- that fire, I
mean, which is unmixed and most luminous and most active and most fecund, --
and raised it up aloft from the water.
