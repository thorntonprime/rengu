The great quality of wisdom is that it always responds with precisely
what’s needed. Like a well-aimed, sharp pointed sword  --   it always hits the
spot. When we grow in wisdom we understand and can control our mind.

A wise person is always kind and considerate. He always sees what’s needed.
He lets snow flakes fall on an overheated body. He provides cool water to
slake a desperate thirst.
