Title: Our Closest Friend
---
Our effort, I suggest, can be dedicated to this： to assume the unity of
Life and Death and let it be progressively demonstrated to us. So long as
we stand in opposition to Death we will disfigure it. Believe me, my dear
Countess, Death is our Friend, our closest friend, perhaps the only friend
who can never be misled by our ploys and vacillations. And I do not mean that
in the sentimental, romantic sense of distrusting or renouncing life. Death
is our friend precisely because it brings us into absolute and passionate
presence with all that is here, that is natural, that is love. ... Life
always says Yes and No simultaneously. Death (I implore you to believe)
is the true Yea-sayer. It stands before eternity and says only： Yes.
