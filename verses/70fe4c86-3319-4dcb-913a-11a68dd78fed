Title: Your Face
---
It’s not quite right to call your face pretty.
Prettiness is a matter of human faces,
but your beauty exceeds humanity.

It's hard to fathom how nature gave such beauty to a person.
I know： it’s because there’s no match for you in nature.

What lotus flower can compare to your lips?
Where is the white jade that matches your complexion?
Have spring-lake ripples like your glances ever been seen?
Has morning light like the scent of your smile ever been heard?
Heaven’s music is the echo of your song.
Exquisite stars are the forms of your eyes.

I am your shadow.
Only your shadow can match you.
It’s not quite right to call your face pretty.
