A good Hindu or a good Musalman should be a better Hindo or a better Musalman
for being a lover of his country. There never can be any conflict between
the real interest of one's country and that of one's religion. Where
there appears to be any there is something wrong with one's religion, i.e.,
one's morals. True religion means good thought and good conduct. True
patriotism also means good thought and good conduct. To set up a comparison
between two synonymous things is wrong.
