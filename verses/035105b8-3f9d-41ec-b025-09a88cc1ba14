Title: Holds Us Captive
Description: June 27
---
Look at the sweetness of their play, those lion cubs. Look at part of beautyâ€™s
 beauty,
it holds us captive to what delights.
All those paws in a dancing motion, they are a blessing to my eye.
It should be like this; all that can open the heart in heaven ... can be found
 on earth.
Love reveals the paradise.
