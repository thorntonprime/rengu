All creatures are with God; the being that they have God gives them with his
presence.  Saith the bride in the Book of Love, ‘I have run round the circle
and have found no end to it, so I cast myself into the centre.’

This circle which the loving soul ran round is all the Trinity has ever
wrought. ... Spent with her quest she casts herself into the centre. This point
is the power of the Trinity wherein unmoved it is doing all its work. Therein
the soul becomes omnipotent.
