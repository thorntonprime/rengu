When the captain sees the girl,
he immediately falls in love with her
like the Caliph.

Don't laugh at this.
His loving is also part of infinite love,
without which the world does not evolve.

Forms move from inorganic to vegatation
to selves endowed with spirit
through the urgency of every love
that wants to come to perfection.
