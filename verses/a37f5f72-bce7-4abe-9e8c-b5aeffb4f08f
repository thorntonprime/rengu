Title: Our Secret Entry
---
What is our secret entry
into Your heart?

We find it on the path of
letting go of what we

thought we knew, arriving
at the place where we

know nothing of knowing
beyond every notion of love,

and from light enter
the dark only to find

ourselves there, ever
one with You.
