How often are you worrying about the present moment? The present
moment is usually all right. If you’re worrying, you’re either agonizing
over the past which you should have forgotten long ago, or else you’re
apprehensive over the future which hasn’t even come yet. We tend to skip
over the present moment which is the only moment God gives any of us to
live.
