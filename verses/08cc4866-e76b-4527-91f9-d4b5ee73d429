Title: A Bowl Thrown Out
---
Stay. Do not make excuses to leave.
Serve us more wine from this friendship's vineyard.
Do not turn to the window or the porch.
Live here in this circle.

Wanting what is outside is a bait that will trap you.
Step out onto sky through the round threshold.
Be alone in your search for absolute aloneness.

Be a bowl thrown out on the ocean,
not a bowl held out for more going kitchen to kitchen.
Time is bright, then dark, warm and cold by turns.
Live at the springhead where the flowing begins.

Do not find fault, and do not compliment anyone.
Do not offer pastry or garlic.
What's the use?

You may as well tell torches not to burn.
Say to whatever burns, Burn!
Except for the ache of separation.
But that is not always true either.
Anything put into words is questionable.
