Title: All the Hemispheres
---
Leave the familiar for a while. Let your senses and bodies stretch out

like a welcomed season onto meadows and shores and hills.

Open up to the roof. Make a new watermark on your excitement and love.

Like a blooming night flower, bestow your vital fragrance of happiness
and giving upon our intimate assembly.

Change rooms in your mind for a day. All the hemispheres in existence
lie beside an equator in your soul.

Greet yourself in your thousand other forms as you mount the hidden
tide and travel back home.

All the hemispheres in heaven are sitting around a campfire chatting,
while

stitching themselves together into the great circle inside of you.
