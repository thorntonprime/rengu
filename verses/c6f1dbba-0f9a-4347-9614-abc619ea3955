Title: Deepening the Present
---
I have entered the new and holy year with the feeling that I have somehow,
secretly, been granted a new life and a new hope -- or a return of the old
life and hope I used to have.

The contemplative life becomes awfully thin and drab if you go for several
days at a time without thinking explicitly of the Passion of Christ. I
do not mean, necessarily, meditation, but at least attending with love and
humility to Christ on the Cross. For His Cross is the source of all our life,
and without it prayer dries up and everything goes dead.

A saint is not so much a man who realizes that he possesses virtues and
sanctity as one who is overwhelmed by the sanctity of God. God is holiness.And
therefore things are holy in proportion as they share Who He is. All creatures
are holy in so far as they share in His being, but we are called to be holy
in a far superior way -- by somehow sharing His transcendence and rising
above the level of everything that is not God.

Solitude is not found so much by looking outside the boundaries of your
dwelling, as by staying within. Solitude is not something you must hope for
in the future. Rather, it is a deepening of the present, and unless you look
for solitude in the present, you will never find it.
