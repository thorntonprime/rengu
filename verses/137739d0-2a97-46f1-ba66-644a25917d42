He who holds to True Rightness does not lose the original form of his
inborn nature. So for him joined things are not webbed toes, things
forking off are not superfluous fingers, the long is never too much,
the short is never too little. The duck's legs are short, but to
stretch them out would worry him; the crane's legs are long, but to cut
them down would make him sad. What is long by nature needs no cutting
off; what is short by nature needs no stretching. That would be no way
to get rid of worry. I wonder, then, if benevolence and righteousness
are part of man's true form? Those benevolent men-how much worrying
they do!
