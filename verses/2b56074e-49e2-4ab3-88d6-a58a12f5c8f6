These exalted and most noble men are just like the wood of the vine which
is outwardly hard and black and dry, and good for no purpose whatever;
and if we had never seen it before, we should think it of no use at all,
and good for nothing but to be thrown into the fire, and burned. But in
this dry wood of the vine, there lie concealed the living veins of sap,
and power of yielding the noblest of all juices, and of bringing forth
a greater abundance of fruit than any other sort of wood that grows. And
thus it is with these beloved and lowly children, who are at all times and
seasons plunged in God; they are outwardly in appearance like unto black
rotten wood, seeming unto men dry and unprofitable. For there are many of
these who are humble, noways remarkable for their gifts, outward or inward,
nor for any extraordinary works or sayings or exercises of devotion, and who
move in the narrowest sphere; but living veins from the fountain of truth
lie hidden within them, forasmuch as they have asked for no earthly heritage,
but God is their lot and their portion, their life and their being.
