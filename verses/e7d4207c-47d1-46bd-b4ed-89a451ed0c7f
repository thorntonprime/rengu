Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Heaven and earth hold fast to their constant ways, the sun and moon to
their brightness, the stars and planets to their ranks, the birds and
beasts to their flocks, the trees and shrubs to their stands. You have
only to go along with Virtue in your actions, to follow the Way in your
journey, and already you will be there. Why these flags of benevolence
and righteousness so bravely upraised, as though you were beating a
drum and searching for a lost child? Ah, you will bring confusion to
the nature of man!"
