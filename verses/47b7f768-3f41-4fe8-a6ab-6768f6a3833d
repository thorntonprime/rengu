There is a general agreement, East and West, that life in a body provides
uniquely good opportunities for achieving salvation or deliverance. Catholic
and Mahayana Buddhist doctrine is alike in insisting that the soul in its
disembodied state after death cannot acquire merit, but merely suffers in
purgatory the consequences of its past acts. But whereas Catholic orthodoxy
declares that there is no possibility of progress in the next world, and
that the degree of the souls beatitude is determined solely by what it
has done and thought in its earthly life, the eschatologists of the Orient
affirm that there are certain posthumous conditions in which meritorious
souls are capable of advancing from a heaven of happy personal survival
to genuine immortality in union with the timeless, eternal Godhead. And,
of course, there is also the possibility (indeed, for most individuals, the
necessity) of returning to some form of embodied life, in which the advance
towards complete beatification, or deliverance through enlightenment, can be
continued. Meanwhile, the fact that one has been born in a human body is one
of the things for which, says Shankara, one should daily give thanks to God.
