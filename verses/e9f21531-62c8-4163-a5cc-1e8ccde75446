Title: Rulers
---
The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;
The next best are loved and praised;
The next are feared;
The next despisedï¼š
They have no faith in their people,
And their people become unfaithful to them.

When the best rulers achieve their purpose
Their subjects claim the achievement as their own.
