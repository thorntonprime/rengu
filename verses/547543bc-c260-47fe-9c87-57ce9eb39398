Title: Put This Design in Your Carpet
Description: September 2-3
---
Spiritual experience is a modest woman
who looks lovingly at only one man.

It is a great river where ducks
live happily, and crows drown.

The visible bowl of form contains food
that is both nourishing and a source of heartburn.

There is an unseen presence we honor
that gives the gifts.

You are water. We are the millstone.
You are the wind. We are dust blown up into shapes.
You are spirit. We're the opening and closing
of our hands. You are the clarity.
We are this language that tries to say it.
You are joy. We are all the different kinds of laughing.

Any movement or sound is a profession of faith,
as the millstone grinding is explaining
how it believes in the river.
No metaphor can explain this,
but I cannot stop pointing to the beauty.

Every moment and place says,
Put this design in your carpet.

I want to be in such a passionate adoration
that my tent gets pitched against the sky.

Let the beloved come
and sit like a guard dog
in front of the tent.

When the ocean surges,
don't let me just hear it.
Let is splash inside my chest.
