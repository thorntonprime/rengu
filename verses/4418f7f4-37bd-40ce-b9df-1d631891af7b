Title: I Begin to Awaken
---
There is an element of emptiness and anguish from the concentration of the
annual retreat, but not much. Actually I feel more sure than I ever have
in my life that I am obeying the Lord and am on the way He wills for me,
though at the same time I am struck and appalled (more than ever!) by the
shoddiness of my response. I am just beginning to awaken and to realize
how much more awakening is to come. And how much is to be faced. How much I
must admit and renounce ambition and agitated self-seeking in my work and
contacts (I am so tied up in all this that I don't know whe to start getting
free!). But God will take care of me, for in my confusion and helplessness
I nevertheless feel (believe in) His closeness and strength. I don't have
to know and see how it will all come out.

My intention is, in fact, simply to "die" to the past somehow. To live more
abandoned to God's will and less concerned with projects and initiatives. More
detached from work and events, more solitary. To be one of those who entirely
practices contemplation simply in order to follow Christ.
