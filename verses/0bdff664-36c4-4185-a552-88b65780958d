Title: The Small Dark Light
Commentary: |
  There is a third stanza in all the texts:

    Fish should stay underwater:
    the real means of rule
    should be kept dark.

  Or, more literally, “the State’s sharp weapons ought not to be shown to
  the people.” This Machiavellian truism seems such an anticlimax to the
  great theme stated in the first verses that I treat it as an intrusion,
  perhaps a commentator’s practical example of “the small dark light.”

What seeks to shrink
must first have grown;
what seeks weakness
surely was strong.
What seeks its ruin
must first have risen;
what seeks to take
has surely given.

This is called the small dark light：
the soft, the weak prevail
over the hard, the strong.
