All would have Christ to be their Saviour in the next world and to help them
into Heaven when they die by His power and merits with God. But this is not
willing Christ to be thy Saviour; for His salvation, if it is had. must be had
in this world; if He saves thee it must be done in this life, by changing and
altering all that is within thee, by helping thee to a new heart, as He helped
the blind to see. the lame to walk, and the dumb to speak. For to have
salvation from Christ is nothing else but to be made like unto Him.
