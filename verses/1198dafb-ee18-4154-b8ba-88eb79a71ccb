By: Sextus the Pythagorean
Commentary: |
  Traditional or true sciences are qualitative and integral and have their
  origin in metaphysical and cosmological principles, so that there can be
  no question of any ‘conflict between science and religion'.

  Profane sciences are quantitative and divisive, and originate from the
  residues of traditional sciences, wherefore they cannot but be at enmity
  with religion. Cf. Guénon： Le Règne de la Quantité.

Divine wisdom is true science.
