I need not say that when the soul is once got up to the top of this bright
Olympus, it will then no more doubt of its own immortality, or fear any
dissipation, or doubt whether any drowsy sleep shall hereafter seize upon it;
no, it will then feel itself grasping fast and safely its own immortality,
and view itself in the horizon of eternity.
