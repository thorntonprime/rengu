Since the Maximum is the Absolute infinite and therefore all things
without distinction, it is clear that it cannot have a proper name. ... All
affirmations, therefore, that are made of God in theology are anthropomorphic,
including even those most holy Names, which enshrine the highest mysteries
of divine knowledge.
