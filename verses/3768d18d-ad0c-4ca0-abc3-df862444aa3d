Title: My Deep Youthful Shyness
---
A bright, snowy afternoon, delicate blue clouds of snow blowing down off the
frozen trees. Forcibly restrained myself from much work around the hermitage,
made sure of my hour’s meditation and will do more later. How badly I
need it. I realize how great is the tempo and pressure of work I have been
in down in the community -- with many irons in the fire. True, I have in the
community gained the knack of dropping everything and completely relaxing my
attention and forgetting the work by going out and looking at the hills. Good
that the novitiate work is not exceedingly absorbing. (Biggest trouble now
is letter writing.)

Shall I look at the past as if it were something to analyze and think
about? Rather, I thank God for the present, not for myself in the present,
but for the present that is His and in Him. The past： I am inarticulate
about it now. I remember irrelevant moments of embarrassment, and my joys
are seen to have been largely meaningless. Yet, as I sit here in this
wintry and lonely and quiet place, I suppose I am the same person as the
eighteen-year-old riding back alone into Bournemouth on a bus out of the
New Forest, where I had camped a couple of days and nights. I suppose I
regret most my lack of love, my selfishness and glibness (covering a deep
shyness and need of love) with girls who, after all, did love me, I think,
for a time. My great fault was my inability really to believe it, and my
efforts to get complete assurance and perfect fulfillment.
