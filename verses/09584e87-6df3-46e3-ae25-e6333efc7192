Everyone in the world risks his life for something. If he risks it for
benevolence and righteousness, then custom names him a gentleman; if he
risks it for goods and wealth, then custom names him a petty man. The
risking is the same, and yet we have a gentleman here, a petty man
there. In destroying their lives and blighting their inborn nature,
Robber Chih and Po Yi were two of a kind. How then can we pick out the
gentleman from the petty man in such a case?
