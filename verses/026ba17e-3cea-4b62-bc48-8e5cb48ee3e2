Let the soul that is not unworthy of the vision contemplate the Great Soul;
freed from deceit and every witchery and collected into calm. Calmed be the
body for it in that hour and the tumult of the flesh, ay, all that is about it
calm; calm be the earth, the sea, the air, and let heaven itself be still.
Then let it feel how into that silent heaven the Great Soul floweth in!
