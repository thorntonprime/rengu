What wilt thou do with the body? This poor flesh, which thou guardest
in order to feed vultures, jackals, and the like, is fitted only to be
a tool for men’s works. Though thou guardest it thus, pitiless Death
will tear away the body and give it to the vultures; and then what
wilt thou do? To a servant who will not remain, gifts of garments and
the like are not given; when it has eaten, the body will depart, then
why waste thy riches upon it? Pay to it its wage, then set thy thought
upon thine own business; for we give not to the hireling all that he
may earn. Conceive of the body as a ship that travels to and fro, and
make it go at thy bidding for creatures to fulfil their end.
