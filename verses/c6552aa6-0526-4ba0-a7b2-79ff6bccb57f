The knowledge has newly come： perchance you have no knowledge.
The envious heart is bleeding： perchance you have no heart.
The moon has revealed her face and opened her radiant wings：
Borrow a soul and eyes from some one, if you have them not.
Night and day comes a winged arrow from the hidden bow.
Yield up your sweet life; what can you do? you have no shield.
Has not the copper of your existence been changed, like Moses, to gold by
 his alchemy?
What matter tho'you have no gold in a sack, like Qarun?
Within you is an Egypt, and you are its garden of sugarcanes;
What matter tho'you have no supply of sugar from without?
You are become a slave to form, like idol-worshippers;
You resemble Joseph and yet you gaze not on yourself.
By God, when you behold your own beauty in the mirror,
You will be the idol of yourself, you will not pass over to any one.
O Reason, art not thou unjust in calling him moon-like?
Wherefore dost thou call him moon? perchance thou hast no sight.
Your head is like a lamp containing six wicks：
How should all the six be alight unless you have that spark?
Your body is like a camel which goes to the Ka'ba of the soul;
You failed to go on the pilgrimage because of your ass's nature, not
 because you have no ass.
If you have not gone to the Ka'ba, Fortune will draw you thither.
Do not flee, O babbler, for you have no refuge from God.
