If a man doomed to death be released with one hand cut off, is it not well
for him? and if one through human tribulations escapes hell, is it not also
well for him? If one cannot bear the small suffering of the moment, then why
does he not put away the wrath that will bring upon him the agonies of
hell?  ... I may be cleft, pierced, burnt, split open many and many a time
for countless millions of aeons, and never win the Enlightenment. But this
pain that wins me the Enlightenment is of brief term; it is like the pain of
cutting out a buried arrow to heal its smart. All physicians restore health
by painful courses; then to undo much suffering let us bear a little.
