What life is so much to be dreaded as a life of worldly ease and prosperity?
What a misery, nay, what a curse is there in everything that gratifies and
nourishes our self-love, self-esteem, and self seeking! On the other hand,
what happiness is there in all inward and outward troubles and vexations when
they force us to feel and know the hell that is hidden within us and the
vanity of everything without us, when they turn all our self-love into
self-abhorrence and force us to call upon God to save us from ourselves, to
give us a new life, new light, and new spirit in Christ Jesus.

‘O happy famine,’ might the poor Prodigal have well said, ‘which, by reducing
me to the necessity of asking to eat husks with swine, brought me to myself
and caused my return to my first happiness in my father’s house.’ ...

O happy famine, which leaves you not so much as the husk of one human comfort
to feed upon! For this is the time and place for all that good and life and
salvation to happen to you which happened to the Prodigal Son.
