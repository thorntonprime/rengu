Nothing can repose in itself, except by returning into that from which it has
gone forth. The heart is deflected from Unity into a desire for sensation in
order to taste the differentiation of properties; by that are born in it the
differentiation and contradiction which henceforth dominate the heart. And it
cannot be relieved, except by abandoning itself such as it is in the desire
for properties and by mounting once more into the most pure Calm, and by
striving to silence its will, in such manner that the will beyond all sense
and specific appearance is plunged into the eternal will of the Undetermined,
out of which it has arisen in the beginning, i.e., out of the Mysterium
Magnum, so that it no longer wills anything except what God wills for it.
