Title: In the Darkness of My Empty Mind
---
The blue elm tree near at hand and the light blue hills in the distance：
the red bare clay where I am supposed to plant some shade trees： these
are before me as I sit in the sun for a free half hour between spiritual
direction and work.Today, as I sit in the sun, big blue and purple fish swim
past me in the darkness of my empty mind, this sea which opens within me as
soon as I close my eyes. Delightful darkness, delightful sun, shining on a
world which, for all I care, has already ended.

It does not occur to me to wonder whether we will ever transplant the young
maples from the wood, yonder, to this bare leveled patch -- the place where the
old horse barn once stood. It does not occur to me to wonder how everything
came to be transformed. I sit on a cedar log half chewed by some novice’s
blunt axe, and do not reflect on plans I have made for this place of prayer,
because they do not matter. They will happen when they happen.

The hills are as pure as jade in the distance. God is in His transparent
world, but He is too sacred to be mentioned, too holy to be observed. I sit
in silence.The big deep fish are purple in my sea.
