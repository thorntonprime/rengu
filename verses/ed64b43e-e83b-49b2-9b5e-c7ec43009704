Who would follow the Way
must go beyond words.
Who would know the world
must go beyond names.

Nameless, all things begin.
Named, all things are born.

Empty of intent, one may be filled with awe.
Full of intent, one may know what's manifest.
One source, different fonts.
Wonders both.

From wonder into wonder,
existence opens.
