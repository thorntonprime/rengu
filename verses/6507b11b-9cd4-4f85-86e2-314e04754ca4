Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Men of the world who value the Way all turn to books. But books are
nothing more than words. Words have value; what is of value in words is
meaning. Meaning has something it is pursuing, but the thing that it is
pursuing cannot be put into words and handed down. The world values
words and hands down books but, though the world values them, I do not
think them worth valuing. What the world takes to be value is not real
value.
