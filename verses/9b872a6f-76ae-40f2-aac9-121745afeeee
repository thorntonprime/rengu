He who fondly imagines to get more of God in thoughts, prayers, pious
offices and so forth, than by the fireside or in the stallï¼š in sooth
he does but take God, as it were, and swaddle his head in a cloak and
hide him under the table. For he who seeks God under settled forms
lays hold of the form while missing the God concealed in it.
