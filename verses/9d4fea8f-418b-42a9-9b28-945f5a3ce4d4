For man is a being of divine nature; he is comparable, not to the other living
creatures upon earth, but to the gods in heaven. Nay, if we are to speak the
truth without fear, he who is indeed a man is even above the gods of heaven,
or at any rate he equals them in power. None of the gods of heaven will
ever quit heaven, and pass its boundary, and come down to earth; but man
ascends even to heaven, and measures it; and what is more than all beside,
he mounts to heaven without quitting the earth; to so vast a distance can
he put forth his power. We must not shrink then from saying that a man on
earth is a mortal god, and that a god in heaven is an immortal man.
