Garden of Eden -- expulsion
        1st step toward maturity

gospel of Eve --
  Struggle toward a maturity of being --
  Struggle to return to that “bright nature” which was lost.
  Struggle to acquire the “bright nature” of faith --

The Summons to the stage of one’s most inner being --
The Summons to appear in the garden before the god --
  To show the treasures of one’s inheritance --

  Fan
bridal wreath
veil of sorrow
cloak

an accounting to Eve -- Mary -- Magdalene -- you -- of a woman’s
inheritance

Her care of her treasures that she may achieve the “bright nature”
which is hers -- her maturity-

Temptation
Ordeal --

From the hands of the Mother (Eve) from the tree in the garden --
  Terror -- sorrow
  bridal -- love -- happiness --
Enter into tree -- receive dress from within --
  a shrine
  a symbol of Eden -- Yew Tree
some device when she is within --
  ringing of bells --
  darkness --
  fluttering on the strings
    magical -- supernatural
    moment of deeply felt terror -- beauty --

      garden in the desert --
        an oasis of hope -- faith
        symbol of re-birth --
          continuity of life --
