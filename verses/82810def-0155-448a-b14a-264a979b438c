It is easier to do the right thing when we know what the right thing to do
is. We can’t rely on instinct to find the Way. We need guidance.

But once we’re shown the path and begin to climb it, we find that with each
step up we grow in wisdom and fortitude. Looking down we see how many of
our old desires have fallen dead on the wayside. They look so feeble lying
there that we wonder why we ever thought we lacked the courage to resist
them.

The Mountain of Wisdom is different from other mountains. The higher we
climb the stronger we grow.
