Title: Double Seventh
---
\“Rather than living without you, I’ll become somebody else,
but not the Weaver Girl in the sky ...,”
1 once said coquettishly, searching your eyes.
In these words there is a sympathy：
How can the Weaver Girl bear to meet her Herdsman but once a year,
 on the seventh day of the seventh month?
In these words there is a conceit：
a vow to be preoccupied always by your kisses,
like a butterfly drunk on peonies.

The future is hard to know, vows difficult to keep.
The Double Seventh has passed ten times and more since you held me.
The Weaver Girl and Herdsman look at me with pity, but no gloating.

Night after night, they look across the Silver River and talk to each other.
On its banks, they splash water and relive regrets.
They recline with their feet in the water and sing songs,
pretending not to see each other.
They inscribe reed boats and blow them across to each other.
Reading them, they act like they don’t understand.
When it’s time to go, they say nothing and smile at each other.

It’s now the evening of the Double Seventh.
They wear lotus robes pleated with orchid thread.
They sport laurel beads that shine with the seven colors.
Their cheeks flush in anticipation of drunken kisses,
overcome by the heat of their own happiness.
As they cross the Magpie Bridge, they pause to check
 their trailng robes.
They cross and in their embrace, tears and laughter know no order.
The future is hard to know vows difficult to keep.

Their love is a display.
There is no way to show true love.
They cannot see my love.
The sacredness of love is not in display but in secrecy.
If they waved me to join them, I would not go.
It’s now the evening of the Double Seventh.
