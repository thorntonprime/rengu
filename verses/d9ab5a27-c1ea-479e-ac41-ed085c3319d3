Faith in God, then, is one sure and infallible good, consolation of
life, plenitude of bright hopes, dearth of ills, harvest of goods,
inacquaintance with misery, acquaintance with piety, heritage of
happiness, all-round betterment of the soul which is fairly stayed on
Him Who is the cause of all things and can do all things yet only
wills the best.
