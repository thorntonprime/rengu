There is a certain wisdom that settles into a life that does not attempt to
control what everybody else ought to be thinking, saying, doing, or voting
on. Wisdom, health, life, and love cannot be found in trying to control
the mind, but rather in 'harnessing the wind in' the sails of receptive
engagement of the present moment. The most searching example of doing just
this is quite Simply to return to our practice rather than indulge in yet
another video, yet another strategy of control. This ability is a result of
deepening interior silence and makes it easier to give ourselves entirely
to the praying of the prayer word.
