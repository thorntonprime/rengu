Raised：

A monk asked Zhaozhou, "'The Far-reaching Way is without difficulty,
only rejecting picking and choosing' So what doesn't pick and choose?"

Zhou said, "'Above the heavens, below the heavens, only I, alone and
honored.'"

The monk said, "This is tantamount to picking and choosing."

Zhou said, "You field-and-village slave, where is picking and
choosing?"

The monk was speechless.

[Xuedou's attached word said] "Village(r)."
