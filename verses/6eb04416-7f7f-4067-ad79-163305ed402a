Title: Liberation From All Obstructions
---
“In the presence of Sangha, in the light of Dharma, 
in oneness with Buddha -- may my path
to complete enlightenment benefit everyone!”

In this passing moment karma ripens 
and all things come to be. 
I vow to choose what is：
If there is cost, I choose to pay.
If there is need, I choose to give.
If there is pain, I choose to feel. 
If there is sorrow, I choose to grieve.
When burning -- I choose heat.
When calm -- I choose peace.
When starving -- I choose hunger.
When happy -- I choose joy.
Whom I encounter, I choose to meet.
What I shoulder, I choose to bear.
When it is my death, I choose to die.
Where this takes me, I choose to go.
Being with what is -- I respond to what is.

This life is as real as a dream; 
the one who knows it cannot be found; 
and, truth is not a thing -- Therefore I vow 
to choose THIS dharma entrance gate!
May all Buddhas and Wise Ones 
help me live this vow.
