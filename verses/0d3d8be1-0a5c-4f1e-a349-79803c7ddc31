In the quiet of the morning I heard a knock at my door： threw on
  my clothes and opened it myself.
I asked who it was who had come so early to see me.
He said he was a peasant, coming with good intent.
He brought a present of wine and rice-soup,
Believing that I had fallen on evil days.
‘You live in rags under a thatched roof
And seem to have no desire for a better lot.
The rest of mankind have all the same ambitions：
You, too, must learn to wallow in their mire.’
‘Old man, I am impressed by what you say,
But my soul is not fashioned like other men’s.
To drive in their rut I might perhaps learn：
To be untrue to myself could only lead to muddle.
Let us drink and enjoy together the wine you have brought：
For my course is set and cannot now be altered
