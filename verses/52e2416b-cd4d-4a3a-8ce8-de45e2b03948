Sir. what do you think of Theosophy?

Master： ‘I have heard that man can acquire superhuman powers through
it and perform miracles. I saw a man who had brought a ghost under
control. The ghost used to procure various things for his master. What
shall I do with superhuman powers? Can one realize God through them?
If God is not realized then everything becomes false.’
