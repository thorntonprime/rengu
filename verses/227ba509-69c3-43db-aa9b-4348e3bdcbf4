The aspiration of a traveller lists not to pause upon a thing unveiled to it
but what the appeals of the Truth call out to him： ‘That which thou seekest
lies yet before thee!'; and the adornments of creatures do not become
conspicuous but what their true natures call out to thee： ‘Verily are we but
a seduction, wherefore do not fall into disbelief!'
