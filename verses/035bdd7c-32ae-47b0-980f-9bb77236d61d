The Nameless Man said, "Get away from me, you peasant! What kind of a
dreary question is that! I'm just about to set off with the Creator.
And if I get bored with that, then I'll ride on the Light-and-Lissome
Bird out beyond the six directions, wandering in the village of
Not-Even-Anything and living in the Broad-and-Borderless field. What
business do you have coming with this talk of governing the world and
disturbing my mind?"
