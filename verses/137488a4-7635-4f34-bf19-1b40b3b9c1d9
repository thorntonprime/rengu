All the Sages who have written on our Art, have spoken of the work and regimen
of Saturn; and their remarks have led many to choose common lead as the
substance of the Stone. But you should know that our Saturn, or lead, is a
much nobler substance than gold.  It is the living earth in which the soul of
gold is joined to Mercury. ... Happy is he who can salute this planet, and
call it by its right name.
