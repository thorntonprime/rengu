One who has only a mild spirit of renunciation says, ‘Well, all will happen
in the course of time; let me now simply repeat the name of God.’ But a man
possessed of a strong spirit of renunciation feels restless for God, as the
mother feels for her own child. A man of strong renunciation seeks nothing
but God. He regards the world as a deep well and feels as if he were going to
be drowned in it. He looks on his relatives as venomous snakes; he wants to
fly away from them. And he does go away. He never thinks, ‘Let me first make
some arrangement for my family and then I shall think of God.' He has great
inward resolution.
