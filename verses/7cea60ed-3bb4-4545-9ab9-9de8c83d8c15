Therefore, since the world has still
Much good, but much less good than ill,
And while the sun and moon endure
Luck’s a chance, but trouble’s sure,
I'd face it as a wise man would,
And train for ill and not for good.
’Tis true, the stuff I bring for sale
Is not so brisk a brew as ale：
Out of a stem that scored the hand
I wrung it in a weary land.
But take it： if the smack is sour,
The better for the embittered hour;
It should do good to heart and head
When your soul is in my soul’s stead;
And I will friend you, if I may
In the dark and cloudy day.

There was a king reigned in the East：
There, when kings will sit to feast,
They get their fill before they think
With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.
He gathered all that springs to birth
From the many-venomed earth;
First a little, thence to more,
He sampled all her killing store,-
And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,
State the king when healths went round.
They put arsenic in his meat
And stared aghast to watch him eat;
They poured strychnine in his cup
And shook to see him drink it up：
They shook, they stared as White’s their shirt：
Them it was their poison hurt.
-- I tell the tale that I heard told.
Mithridates, he died old.
