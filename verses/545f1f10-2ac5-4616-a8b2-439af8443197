Know the masculine
But keep to the feminine,
And be a valley to the realm.
If you are a valley to the realm
Then constant virtue won’t leave you,
And you will return to infancy.
Know the bright
But keep to the shadows,
And be a pattern for the realm.
If you are a pattern for the realm
Then constant virtue will not be lacking
And you will return to the unlimited.
Know the glorious
But keep to the humble
And be a valley to the realm.
If you are a valley to the realm
Then constant virtue will be complete
And you will return to the un-carved block.
The un-carved block is cut into ‘vessels’.
Wise men use them, as rulers of ‘vessels’.
The great cutter
Does not cut away.
