Day of Recollection. If I were to make any resolutions, it would be
the same old ones no need to make them -- they have been made. No need to
reflect on them -- it doesn‘t take much concentration to see how I keep
them. I struggle along. It is useless to break your head over the same old
details week after week and year after year, pruning the same ten twigs
off the top of the tree. Get at the roof： union with God. On these days
of recollection drop everything and hide in yourself to find Him in the
silence where He is hidden within you, and listen to what He has to say.

There is only one thing to live for： love. There is only one
unhappiness： not to love God. That is what pains me on these days
of recollection, to see my own soul so fill] of movement and shadows and
vanities, cross-currents of dry wind stirring up the dust and rubbish of
desire. I don’t expect to avoid this humiliation in my life, but when
will I become cleaner, more simple, more loving? “Have mercy on me,
O God. My sin is always before me."
