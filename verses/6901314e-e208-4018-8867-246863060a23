      The moving (chala) japa can be done at all times, whether coming or
      going, standing or sitting, acting or bearing, giving or taking,
      sleeping or waking, during sexual acts or performance of other
      functions -- without shyness, by uttering the name of God. All
      can do it. It knows no limits, or rule. It purifies the voice and
      gives it great strength. But those who do this japa must avoid
      speaking lies, nor should they condemn others, speak harsh words,
      talk nonsense, or too much. This japa brings success and makes the
      mind always glad, it leaves no room for worry, annoyance, sorrow,
      pain, ups and downs. He who does this japa is always protected,
      he makes the pilgrimage of life without effort and reaches supreme
      reality. All his actions are a ritual, the mind is detached and
      he knows no fear, being always near God. The Lord himself is the
      vehicle on this the safest path of yoga.

      There is no need for a rosary for this japa, but the adept keeps
      hidden in his clothing some small objects as reminders in case his
      mind becomes distracted. These reminders must not be seen by others,
      nor should his lips move, for this yoga must be kept secret or it
      loses its power.

With every breath repeat that name, unceasing;
In Allâh’s name see every task completed.
