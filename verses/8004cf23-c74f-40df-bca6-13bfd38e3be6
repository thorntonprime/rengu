Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher

\"Such men as they," said Confucius, "wander beyond the realm; men like
me wander within it. Beyond and within can never meet. It was stupid of
me to send you to offer condolences. Even now they have joined with the
Creator as men to wander in the single breath of heaven and earth. They
look upon life as a swelling tumor, a protruding wen, and upon death as
the draining of a sore or the bursting of a boil. To men such as these,
how could there be any question of putting life first or death last?
They borrow the forms of different creatures and house them in the same
body. They forget liver and gall, cast aside ears and eyes, turning and
revolving, ending and beginning again, unaware of where they start or
finish. Idly they roam beyond the dust and dirt; they wander free and
easy in the service of inaction. Why should they fret and fuss about
the ceremonies of the vulgar world and make a display for the ears and
eyes of the common herd?"
