Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher
---
You have had the audacity to take on human form and you are delighted.
But the human form has ten thousand changes that never come to an end.
Your joys, then, must be uncountable. Therefore, the sage wanders in
the realm where things cannot get away from him, and all are preserved.
He delights in early death; he delights in old age; he delights in the
beginning; he delights in the end. If he can serve as a model for men,
how much more so that which the ten thousand things are tied to and all
changes alike wait upon!
