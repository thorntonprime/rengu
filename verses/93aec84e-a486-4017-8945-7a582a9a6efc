I see men who'd deceive other men：
running with a basket of water in their hands.
Though they get home in the space of a breath,
what have they left when they get there?
And I see the deceived：
like bunching onions in the garden,
cut and cut and cut again each day,
yet something of Heaven's always grows back there.
