There is no beginning to what came before, and no end to what will come
after. It is thought that interrupts the flow of time and calibrates it. It
is thought that decides that night follows day, that death follows life,
that some things are tiny while others are huge. What, to the universe, is
big or large, bright or dark, future or past?
