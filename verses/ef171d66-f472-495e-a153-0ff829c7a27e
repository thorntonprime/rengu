Life, death, like falling stars,
can flash so fast, or else come
floating, slow and silent, down.
First comers, dead ten thousand years,
in a finishing flash of sparks.
Next those dead just a thousand years,
and the bones they thought were stones are just
 dirt, now.
And coming on, this flesh of mine, flown on ahead
 of me
a hundred years and in the tomb, already.
