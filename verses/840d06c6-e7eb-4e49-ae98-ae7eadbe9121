Title: Of Course Things Like That Can Happen (3)
---
A few days before the delivery of God's baby, the saint had to visit a
city close by where few knew of him.

He was walking unnoticed past a mosque, and the shouts of God's
admirers happened to fill the air, saying, "Allah, Allah! Where are
You? Reveal Thyself, Beautiful, Precious One."

And the child in the womb of the Master could not remain silent, and
sang back, in an astounding voice,

"I Am Here! I Am Here -- dear life!"

The crowd in the mosque became frantic, and they picked up shoes,
clubs and stones. You know what then happened -- the story becomes
grim. For most cannot bear the truth.

But the moon cannot hold a grudge. It still stops by some nights and
leans over this holy earth and gives each object and creature ... a
full, wet kiss.

For the moon knows that God is amorous deep down—He cannot stop making
love.

From the Unseen and Immaculate we came for a visit to form. All of
heaven, and every world, is but a footstool before our true and
lasting throne.

O Hafiz, look at the splendor of God's kindness： The sun, His Self,
has been planted in a thousand furrows across every soul's body.

Of course my sweet ones, everything God and I say, can happen.
