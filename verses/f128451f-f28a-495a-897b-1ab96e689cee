I am the wind that breathes on the sea
I am the wave of the ocean
I am the murmur of the waves
I am the ox of seven combats
I am the eagle on the rocks
I am the beam of the sun
I am the fairness of plants
I am the valour of the wild boar
I am the salmon leaping
I am the stillness of the lake
I am the word of science
I am the lance-point of battle
I am the divinity who created in the head the fire.
Who throws light on the meeting in the mountains?
Who tells the ages of the moon?
Who teaches where sets the sun?
Who, if not I?
