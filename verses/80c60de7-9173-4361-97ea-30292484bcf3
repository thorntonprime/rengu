By the reigning sympathy and by the fact in nature that there is an
agreement of like forces and an opposition of unlike, we can explain
in the same way as with magic the efficacy of prayers. There is no
question of a will that grants. Some influence falls from the being
addressed upon the petitioner, but that being itself, sun or star,
perceives nothing of it all. The prayer is answered by the mere fact
that part and other part are wrought to one tone like a musical string
which, being plucked at one end, vibrates at the other also. Often,
too, the sounding of one string awakens what might pass for a
perception in another, the result of their being in harmony and tuned
to one musical scale. Now if the vibration in one lyre affects another
by virtue of the sympathy existing between them, then certainly in the
All, even though it is constituted in contraries, there must be one
melodic system; for it contains its unisons as well, and its entire
content, even to those contraries, is a kinship.
