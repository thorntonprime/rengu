Health or reputation： which is held dearer?
Health or possessions： which has more worth?
Profit or loss： which is more troublesome?

Great love incurs great expense,
And great riches incur great fear,
But contentment comes at no cost;
Who knows when to stop
Does not continue into danger,
And so may long endure.
