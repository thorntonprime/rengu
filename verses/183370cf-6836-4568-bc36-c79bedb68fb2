It behoves the doctor, if he will be called a doctor, to study the whole
process, how God has restored the universal in man; which is fully clear
and manifest in the person of Christ, from his entrance into the humanity,
even to his ascension, and sending of the Holy Ghost.

Let him follow this entire process, and then he may find the universal,
provided he be born again of God.
