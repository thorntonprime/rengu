Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
IT IS THE WAY OF HEAVEN to keep moving and to allow no piling up -
hence the ten thousand things come to completion. It is the Way of the
emperor to keep moving and to allow no piling up - hence the whole
world repairs to his court. It is the Way of the sage to keep moving
and to allow no piling up - hence all within the seas bow to him.
Comprehending Heaven, conversant with the sage, walker in the six
avenues and four frontiers of the Virtue of emperors and kings - the
actions of such a man come naturally; dreamily, he never lacks
stillness.
