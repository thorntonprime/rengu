Title: The Sign Of Virtue Complete
---
So the sage has his wanderings. For him, knowledge is an offshoot,
promises are glue, favors are a patching up, and skill is a peddler.
The sage hatches no schemes, so what use has he for knowledge? He does
no carving, so what use has he for glue? He suffers no loss, so what
use has he for favors? He hawks no goods, so what use has he for
peddling? These four are called Heavenly Gruel. Heavenly Gruel is the
food of Heaven, and if he's already gotten food from Heaven, what use
does he have for men? He has the form of a man but not the feelings of
a man. Since he has the form of a man, he bands together with other
men. Since he doesn't have the feelings of a man, right and wrong
cannot get at him. Puny and small, he sticks with the rest of men.
Massive and great, he perfects his Heaven alone.
