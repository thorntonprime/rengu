God, you are my God,
  and I long for you.
My whole being desires you;
  and my soul is thirsty for you,
  like a dry, worn-out, and waterless land.
Let me see you in the sanctuary;
  let me see how mighty and glorious you are.
Your constant love is better than life itself,
  and so I will praise you.
I will give thanks to you as long as I live;
  I will raise my hands to you in prayer.
My soul will feast, and be satisfied
  and I will sing glad songs of praise to you.

As I lie in bed I remember you;
  all night long I think of you,
because you have always been my help.
  In the shadow of your wings I sing for joy.
I cling to you,
 and your hand keeps me safe.
