It was the human spirit itself that failed at Paris. It is no use passing
judgments and making scapegoats of this or that individual statesman or
group of statesmen, idealists make a great mistake in not facing the real
facts sincerely and resolutely. They believe in the power of the spirit,
in the goodness which is at the heart of things, in the triumph which is in
store for the great moral ideals of the race. But this faith only too often
leads to an optimism which is sadly and fatally at variance with actual
results. It is the realist and not the idealist who is generally justified
by events. We forget that the human spirit, the spirit of goodness and
truth in the world, is still only an infant crying in the night, and that
the struggle with darkness is as yet mostly an unequal struggle. ... Paris
proved this terrible truth once more. It 1's not Wilson who failed there,
but humanity itself. It was not the statesmen that failed so much as the
spirit of the peoples behind them.
