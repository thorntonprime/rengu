Title: Still
---
In my darkness, I often seek You
as if You were a candle to cast light

into the darkness that surrounds me
both by day and through the night,

and when I do, what I find is what
I'd thought I needed, and so I throw

away the candle, and so I turn from
the inner spark with its warming glow

which alone can still my restless heart
and carry my longings back to You.
