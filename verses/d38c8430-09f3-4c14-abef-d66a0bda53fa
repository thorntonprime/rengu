  - Invocation=The Glory of the Name
By: Jili
---
The perfection of the Named One is eminently manifested by the fact that
He reveals Himself through His Name to the person who does not know Him,
so that the Name is to the Named as the outward (az-zâhir) is to the inward
(al-bâtin); and in this respect the Name is the Named One Himself.
