Title: Yaoshan Observes an Arrow
---
A monk asked Yaoshan (Medicine Mountain), In a level
field of shallow grass a great stag and the deer became a
herd. So how is one able to shoot and get the great stag
among the great stags?

Shan said, Look... an arrow.

The monk lay down his body then rolled over.

Shan said, Attendant, drag out this dead fellow.

The monk then departed swiftly.

Shan said, What limit is there for this fellows
playing with mud balls?

Xuedou picked it up and said, Although in three steps he
lived, in five steps he had to die gaping at the great stag.

Xuedou's ode says
