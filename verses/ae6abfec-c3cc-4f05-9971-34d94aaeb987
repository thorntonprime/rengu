For him who is sincerely devoted to the religious life, it is the same
whether he refrain from worldly activities or not. ...

For him who is freed from attachment to worldly luxuries, it is the same
whether he practise asceticism or not. ...

For him who hath attained the mastery of his mind, it is the same whether he
partake of the pleasures of the world or not. ...

For him whose humility and faith (with respect to his guru) are unshakable,
it is the same whether he dwell with his guru or not. ...

For him who hath attained the Sublime Wisdom, it is the same whether he be
able to exercise miraculous powers or not.
