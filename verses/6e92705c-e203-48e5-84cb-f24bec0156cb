Tremendous discovery. The Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad!

Kairos! Everything for a long time has been slowly leading up to this, and
with this reading a sudden convergence of roads, tendencies, lights, in unity!

A new door. (Looked at it without comprehension nine months ago.)

Yesterday’s disgust with the trivial, shallow, contemporary stuff I am
tempted to read! No time for that.

Scriptures. Greek patrology. Oriental thought. This is enough to fill every
free corner of the day not given to prayer, meditation, duties.

This morning, the splendor of my Mass! Sun pouring in on the altar and
in glory of reflected lights from the hammered silver chalice splashed
all over the corporal and all around the Host. Deep quiet. The Gospel --
“Do not fear, little flock.” Where your treasure is, there your heart
is also. May I learn the lessons of detachment, even from the little white
house of St. Mary of Carmel. But no nonsense about not desiring solitude. On
the contrary, to desire it in perfection and in truth. Interior and exterior.
