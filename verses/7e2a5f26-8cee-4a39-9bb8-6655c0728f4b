Is it an easy thing to obtain the Knowledge of Brahman? It is not
possible unless the mind is annihilated. The guru said to the
disciple, ‘Give me your mind and I shall give you Knowledge.’ ... A
man attains Brahmajnâna as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the
annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’.
