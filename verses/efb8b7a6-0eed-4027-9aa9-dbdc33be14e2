We love and tend the body, the least agreeable and most vile of all
things! For if we had to tend our neighbour’s body for ten days only
we could not bear it. Consider what it would be to get up in the
morning and clean some one else's teeth, and then to perform some
other necessary office for him. Truly it is wondrous that we should
love that for which we do such mean services day by day. I stuff this
bag; then I empty it; what could be more tiresome? But I am bound to
serve God. That is why I stay here and put up with washing this
miserable body of mine, and giving it fodder and shelter; and when I
was younger, it laid other commands on me as well, and yet I bore with
it. Why then, when Nature, who gave you your body, takes it away, can
you not bear it?
