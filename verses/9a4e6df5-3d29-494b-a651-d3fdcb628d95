If you'd been too stupid, greedy, last time through,
you wouldn't know your heart right now.
If you're poor today,
it's likely because of what you did before.
If you don't try in this life,
the life to come will be the life of old.
There's no ferry upon either shore,
but though it's mighty hard to see the way,
yet you will cross.
