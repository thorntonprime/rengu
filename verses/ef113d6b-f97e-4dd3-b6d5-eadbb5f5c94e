He is bodiless, and yet has many bodies, or rather, is embodied in all bodies.
There is nothing that He is not; for all things that exist are even He. For
this reason all names are names of Him, because all things come from Him, their
one Father; and for this reason He has no name, because He is the Father of
all.
