He (the sacrificer) then offers a dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna.
Now he who performs this (Agni-kayana) rite comes to be with the gods; and
these two, Mitra and Varuna are a divine pair. Now, were he to have intercourse
with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it would be a
descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he offers this
dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna, he thereby approaches a divine mate;
having offered it, he may freely have intercourse in a befitting way.
