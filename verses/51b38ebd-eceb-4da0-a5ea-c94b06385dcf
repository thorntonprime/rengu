If there are men and women who hear the name of the Buddha of Endless
Life and cannot believe in him, and fall into doubt, I say, they are
sinners who have just come from the three wicked worlds, and are
destined to return there. Sin still enchains them, making them so
stupid that they cannot understand the Buddha’s words.
