Of old, these attained the Oneï¼š Heaven attaining the One Became clear.
 Earth attaining the One Became stable. Spirits attaining the One Became
 sacred.
Valleys attaining the One Became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One
 Became fertile. Lords and kings attaining the One Purified the world.
If Heaven were not clear It might split. If Earth were not stable It might
 erupt. If spirits were not sacred They might fade.
If valleys were not bountiful They might wither. If myriad beings were not
 fertile, They might perish. If rulers and lords were not noble, They might
 stumble.
Therefore, Noble has humble as its root, High has low as its foundation.
Rulers and lords call themselves Poor and lonely orphans. Isn't this using
 humility as a root?
They use many carriages But have no carriage;.
They do not desire to glisten like jade But drop like a stone.
