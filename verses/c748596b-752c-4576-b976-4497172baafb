The devils, who are skilful thieves, wish to surprise us unawares, and
to strip us. They watch day and night for the favorable moment. For
that end they go round about us incessantly to devour us and to snatch
from us in one moment, by a sin, all the graces and merits we have
gained for many years. Their malice, their experience, their
stratagems and their number ought to make us fear this misfortune
immensely, especially when we see how many persons fuller of grace
than we are, richer in virtues, better founded in experience and far
higher exalted in sanctity, have been surprised, robbed and unhappily
pillaged.
