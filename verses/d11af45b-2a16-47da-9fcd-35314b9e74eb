Tao engenders One, One engenders Two, Two engenders Three, Three engenders
 the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things carry shade And embrace sunlight. Shade and
 sunlight, yin and yang, Breath blending into harmony.
Humans hate To be alone, poor, and hungry. Yet kings and princes Use these
 words as titles.
We gain by losing, Lose by gaining.
What others teach, I also teachï¼š "A violent man does not die a natural
 death. This is the basis of my teaching.
