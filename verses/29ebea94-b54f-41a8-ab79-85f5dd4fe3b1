While thou first fastnest the Eye of thy Spirit on the Majesty of God, and
then beholdest all Things, as they appear in the Light of the Divine Presence;
thou indeed art in Heavenï¼š All Things are as the Angels of God, as Divine
Emanations. Divine Figures, and Divine Splendors circling thee in on every
side, and God himself as a Fountain of Glories in the midst of them.
