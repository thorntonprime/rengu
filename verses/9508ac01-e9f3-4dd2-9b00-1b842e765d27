Thoroughly to know oneself, is above all art, for it is the highest art. If
thou knowest thyself well, thou art better and more praiseworthy before God,
than if thou didst not know thyself, but didst understand the course of the
heavens and of all the planets and stars, also the virtue of all herbs, and the
structure and dispositions of all mankind, also the nature of all beasts, and,
in such matters, hadst all the skill of all who are in heaven and on earth.
