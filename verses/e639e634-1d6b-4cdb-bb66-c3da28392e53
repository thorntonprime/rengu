Some days later, Duke Ai reported his conversation to Min Tzu." "At
first, when I faced south and became ruler of the realm, I tried to
look after the regulation of the people and worried that they might
die. I really thought I understood things perfectly. But now that I've
heard the words of a Perfect Man, I'm afraid there was nothing to my
understanding - I was thinking too little of my own welfare and ruining
the state. Confucius and I are not subject and ruler-we are friends in
virtue, that's all."
