The seed of metals is hidden out of sight still more completely than
that of animals： nevertheless, it is within the compass of our Art to
extract it. The seed of animals and vegetables is something separate,
and may be cut out, or otherwise separately exhibited： but metallic
seed is diffused throughout the metal, and contained in all its
smallest parts： neither can it be discerned from its body： its
extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the ingenuity of the
most experienced philosopher. ... Let the sons of knowledge learn that
the great object of our Art is the manifestation of the hidden seed of
gold, which can be effected only by full and perfect volatilisation of
that which is fixed, and the subsequent corruption of its particular
form. To break up gold in this way is the most profound secret in the
world. ... Gold does not easily give up its nature, and will fight for
its life, but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it, and
then it also has power to restore it to life, and to change the
lifeless remains into a new pure body.
