Commentary: <
  One can transcend and thus by-pass the flux of forms; one cannot ‘conquer’
  the flux, since it is perpetual on its level of reality (cf. Renunciation,
  p.  143). Hujwiri (Kashf pp. 205-206) cites Shaykh Abû 'All Siyah of Merv：
  ‘I saw my lower soul (nqfs) in a form resembling my own, and some one had
  seized it by its hair and gave it into my hands. I bound it to a tree and
  was about to destroy it, when it cried out, “ O Abû 'Ali, do not trouble
  yourself.  I am God’s army： you cannot reduce me to naught”’

If the ego rises, all else will also rise; if it subsides, all else will also
subside.
