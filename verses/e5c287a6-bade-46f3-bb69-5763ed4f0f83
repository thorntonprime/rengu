I know that you love truth;
  teach me to live in your wholeness.
Cleanse my spirit; wash me,
  and I will be whiter than snow.
Take away my guilt; wipe out
  every last trace of my sin.
Return me to myself and make me
  as pure as a newborn child.
Fill me with peace and gladness;
  let the bones that you crushed rejoice.

Create a pure heart within me;
  let my soul wake up in your light.
Open me to your presence;
  flood me with your holy spirit.
Then I will stand and sing out
  the power of your forgiveness.
I will teach your love to the ignorant;
  the lost will find their way home.
