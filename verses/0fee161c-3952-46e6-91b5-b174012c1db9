  There appears a sly poke here by the Saivas at the Vaishnavas, whose
  perspective (all reservations made) can in fact where conditions conspire
  lean to a certain terrestrial affluence of a nuance something less than
  spiritual.

Vishnu incarnated Himself as a sow in order to kill the demon Hiranyâksha.
After killing the demon, the sow remained quite happy with her young ones.
Forgetting her real nature, she was suckling them very contentedly. The gods
in heaven could not persuade Vishnu to relinquish His sow’s body and return
to the celestial regions. He was absorbed in the happiness of His beast form.
After consulting among themselves, the gods sent Siva to the sow. Siva asked
the sow, ‘Why have you forgotten yourself?’ Vishnu replied through the sow’s
body, ‘Why, I am quite happy here.’ Thereupon with a stroke of his trident
Siva destroyed the sow’s body, and Vishnu went back to heaven.
