Recognize beauty and ugliness is born.
Recognize good and evil is born.
Is and Isn't produce each other. Hard depends on easy, Long is tested by
 short,
High is determined by low, Sound is harmonized by voice, After is followed
 by before.
Therefore the sage is devoted to non action, Moves without teaching,
Creates ten thousand things without instruction, Lives but does not own,
 Acts but does not presume,
Accomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, Accomplishment
 endures.
