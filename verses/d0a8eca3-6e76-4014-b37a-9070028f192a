Listen to the bird singing, It sings naturally, It does not fly to an avian
conservatoire; it pays no fees to another bird -- a prima donna among birds,
It just sings; song happens out of it, It is like the new born baby, who
just lives, It is that mysterious wonder, life, which makes the newborn grow.
