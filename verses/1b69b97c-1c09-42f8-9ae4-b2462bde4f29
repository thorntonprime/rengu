There's a single tree here, twice as old
as the grove that grows, to reckon true.
It's roots have answered every insult
that the mounds and channels
of the changing earth could give,
and its leaves have given way to wind and frost.
People laugh at the gnarled remains,
never thinking of the complex beauty of the grain
 within.
Let the skin and flesh fall free ...
What's true, what's real, is there, inside.
