Sahl b. 'Abdall√¢h (al-Tustari) and others believe that repentance
consists in not forgetting your sins, but always regretting them, so
that, although you have many good works to your credit, you will not
be pleased with yourself on that account; since remorse for an evil
action is superior to good works. ... Junayd and others take the
opposite view, that repentance consists in forgetting the sin. They
argue that the penitent is a lover of God. and the lover of God is in
contemplation of God, and in contemplation it is wrong to remember
sin, for remembrance of sin is a veil between God and those who
contemplate Him.
