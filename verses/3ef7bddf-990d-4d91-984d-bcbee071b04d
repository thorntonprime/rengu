Charlemagne： What is the due order of the soul?

Alcuin： That it love what is higher, that is, God; that it rule what is lower,
that is, the body; and that by its love it nourish and assist its fellow
creatures. For the soul, cleansed and exonerated by these devotions, will fly
back from this troubled and wretched life to eternal peace, and will enter into
the joy of the Lord.
