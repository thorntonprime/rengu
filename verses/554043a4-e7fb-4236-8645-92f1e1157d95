The spirit of prayer is for all times and all occasions; it is a lamp
that is to be always burning, a light to be ever shining; everything
calls for it, everything is to be done in it and governed by it,
because it is and means and wills nothing else but the whole totality
of the soul, not doing this or that, but wholly, incessantly given up
to God to be where and what and how He pleases.
