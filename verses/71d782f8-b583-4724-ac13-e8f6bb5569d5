I have visited the works of art at length in Florence. For hours at a time I
have sat before a particular painting and shaped my opinion of it, and then
later compared it to Burckhardt's fine judgments. And look： my opinion was
like that of so many others.

Once, studying Botticelli's Magnificat, I forgot any judgment of my own or of
others. That is when it happened： I recognized a battle and was awarded a
victory. And my joy was like no other.
