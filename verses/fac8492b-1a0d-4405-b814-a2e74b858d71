Title: Three in the Morning
---
When we wear out our minds, stubbornly clinging to one partial view of
things, refusing to see a deeper agreement between this and its complementary
opposite, we have what is called "three in the morning."

What is this "three in the morning?"

A monkey trainer went to his monkeys and told them：

"As regards your chestnuts： you are going to have three measures in
the morning and four in the afternoon."

At this they all became angry. So he said： "All right, in that case I
will give you four in the morning and three in the afternoon." This time
they were satisfied.

The two arrangements were the same in that the number of chestnuts did
not change. But in one case the animals were displeased, and in the other
they were satisfied. The keeper had been willing to change his personal
arrangement in order to meet objective conditions. He lost nothing by it!

The truly wise man, considering both sides of the question without
partiality, sees them both in the light of Tao.

This is called following two courses at once.
