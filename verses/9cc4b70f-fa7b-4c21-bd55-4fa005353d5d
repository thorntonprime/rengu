Title: I Love "Love"
---
Your face is a quiet star in the spring sky.
But there are faces like the crescent moon
  that appear between the clouds.
If I love only charming faces,
why do I embroider a star instead of the moon on my pillow?

Your heart is flawless jade.
But there are hearts that are steady, brilliant, and hard like gems.
If I love only sublime hearts,
why do I set my ring with jade instead ofjewels?

Your poem is a golden w1llow with new buds unfolding
 in the spring rain.
But there are poems like blooming lilies on an oily black sea.
If I love only fine letters,
why do I sing of willows instead of flowers?

When no one else loved me, you did.
I love not only you; I love your love.
