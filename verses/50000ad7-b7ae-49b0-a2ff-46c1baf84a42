Title: Breaking Through
---
Too often I decide what my
life should be and whether

there is room in it for You
while You sit in a deeper

place within me, wondering
what it will take for me to

make more of all the things
in my life -- the good and

the bad -- and so learn to
break through to find You

in all that is and let You
take form in me in all that

I was and am and will be.
