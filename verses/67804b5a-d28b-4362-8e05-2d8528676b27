I put an end to knowledge and wisdom,
and let thinking disappear into the Great Void.
If I repent for all my wrongs,
how will my heart ever rest?
I go fishing in the one stream
and catch joy as if it were riches.
Letting go, there is nothing left to do but sing --
for my thoughts have drowned in the Great Void.
