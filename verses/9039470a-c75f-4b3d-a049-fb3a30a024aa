Our water is the fire which causes both death, and, through death, a more
glorious life. ... This water, though one, is not simple, but compounded of two
things; the vessel and the fire of the Sages, and the bond which holds the two
together. So when we speak of our vessel, and our fire, we mean by both
expressions, our water; nor is our furnace anything diverse or distinct from
our water. There is then one vessel, one furnace, one fire, and all these make
up one water. The fire digests, the vessel whitens and penetrates, the furnace
is the bond which comprises and encloses all, and all these three are our
Mercury.
