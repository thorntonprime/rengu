In general, magical procedures seem to bear formal resemblance both to
science and to religion. Magic may be a degenerate “applied” form of
either. Consider such rituals as rain dances or the totemic rituals concerned
with man’s relationship to animals. In these types of ritual the human
being invokes or imitates or seeks to control the weather or the ecology
of wild creatures. But I believe that in their primitive state these are
true religious ceremonials. They are ritual statements of unity, involving
all the participants in an integration with the meteorological cycle or
with the ecology of totemic animals. This is religion. But the pathway of
deterioration from religion to magic is always tempting. From a statement
of integration in some often dimly recognized whole, the practitioner turns
aside to an appetitive stance. He sees his own ritual as a piece of purposive
magic to make the rain come or to promote the fertility of the totemic animal
or to achieve some other goal. The criterion that distinguishes magic from
religion is, in fact, propose and especially some extrovert purpose.

Introvert purpose, the desire to change the self, is a very different
matter, but intermediate cases occur. Ifthe hunter performs a ritual
imitation of an animal to cause that animal to come into his net, that
is surely magic; but ifhis purpose in imitating the animal is perhaps
to improve his own empathy and understanding ofthe beast, his action is
perhaps to be classed as religious.
