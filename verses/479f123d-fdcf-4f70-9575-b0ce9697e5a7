Title: Sacrificial Lambs
---
We are sacrificial lambs offering ourselves to a false god

if that God does not make it very clear it wants nothing from us but
to share its glory.

And at times, when we really need to know something about
perfection ...

the movement of your breath might do, or the beating of our hearts.
