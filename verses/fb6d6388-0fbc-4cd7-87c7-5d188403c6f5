Great perfection seems flawed.
Yet use will not diminish it.
Great fullness seems empty
Yet use will not exhaust it.
Great straightness seems bent.
Great skill seems awkward.
Great eloquence seems stilted.
Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
Clear and calm,
One can be a ruler of the realm.
