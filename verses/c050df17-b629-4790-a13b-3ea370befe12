The wind said, "It's true that I whirl up from the North Sea and whirl
off to the South Sea. But if you hold up a finger against me you've
defeated me, and if you trample on me you've likewise defeated me. On
the other hand, I can break down big trees and blow over great houses -
this is a talent that I alone have. So I take all the mass of little
defeats and make them into a Great Victory. To make a Great Victory -
only the sage is capable of that!"
