He who has come to know God is filled with all things good; his thoughts
are divine, and are not like those of the many.

Hence it is that those who have attained to the knowledge of God are not
pleasing to the many, nor the many to them. They are thought mad, and are
laughed at; they are hated and despised, and perhaps they may even be put
to death. For evil ... must needs dwell here on earth, where it is at home;
for the home of evil is the earth, and not the whole universe, as some will
blasphemously say in days to come. But the pious man will endure all things,
cleaving to his knowledge of God. For to such a man all things are good,
even though they be evil to others. When men devise mischief against him,
he sees all this in the light of his knowledge of God; and he, and none but
he, changes things evil into good.
