He (Allâh) hath awarded them (the just) for all that they endured, a Garden
 and silk attire;
Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of)
 sun nor cold of moon.
And near unto them is the shade thereof, and the clustered fruits therein
 bow down.
And vessels of silver are brought round for them, and goblets of crystal. --
Crystal of silver, which they have measured as preordained.
And they are given to drink therein of a cup whose mixture is of Zanjabil;
A spring is there, named Salsabil.
And immortal youths go about them, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst take
 for scattered pearls.
And when thou seest, there wilt thou see bliss and great sovereignty.
Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of
 silver will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink.
Verily, this is a reward for you. Your endeavour hath found acceptance.
