Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Emptiness, stillness, limpidity, silence, inaction - these are the
level of Heaven and earth, the substance of the Way and its Virtue.
Therefore the emperor, the king, the sage rest in them. Resting, they
may be empty; empty, they may be full; and fullness is completion.
Empty, they may be still; still, they may move; moving, they may
acquire. Still, they may rest in inaction; resting in inaction, they
may demand success from those who are charged with activities. Resting
in inaction, they may be merry; being merry, they may shun the place of
care and anxiety, and the years of their life will be long.
