Living in religion (as I can speak by experience) if one is not in a
right course of prayer and other exercises between God and our soul,
oneâ€™s nature groweth much worse than ever it would have been, if one
had lived in the world. For pride and self-love, which are rooted in
the soul by sin. find means to strengthen themselves exceedingly in
religion, if the soul is not in a course that may teach her and
procure her true humility. For by the corrections and contradictions
of the will (which cannot be avoided by any living in a religious
community) 1 find my heart grown, as I may say. as hard as a stone;
and nothing would have been able to soften it but by being put into a
course of prayer, by which the soul tendeth towards God and learneth
of Him the lesson of truly humbling herself.
