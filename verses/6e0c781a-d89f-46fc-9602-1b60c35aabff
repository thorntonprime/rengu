Our Chalybis is the true key of our Art, without which the Torch could
in no wise be kindled, and as the true magi have delivered many things
concerning it, so among vulgar alchemists there is great contention as
to its nature. It is the ore of gold, the purest of all spirits; a
secret, internal, and yet most volatile fire, the wonder of the world,
the result of heavenly virtues in the lower world -- for which reason
the Almighty has assigned to it a most glorious and rare heavenly
conjunction, even that notable sign whose nativity is declared in the
East. This star was seen by the wise men of old, and straightway they
knew that a Great King was born in the world. When you see its
constellation, follow it to the cradle, and there you will behold a
beautiful Infant. Remove the impurities, look upon the face of the
Kingâ€™s Son; open your treasury, give to him gold, and after his death
he will bestow on you his flesh and blood, the highest Medicine in the
three monarchies of the earth.
