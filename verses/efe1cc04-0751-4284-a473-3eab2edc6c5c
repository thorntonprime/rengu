Title: All the Moods of My Place
---
This morning at four. Great full moon over Nally’s hill, pale and clear. A
faint mist hanging over the wet grass of the bottoms.

More and more I appreciate the beauty and solemnity of the “Way” up
through the woods, past the bull barn, up the stony rise, into the grove
of tall, straight oaks and hickories, and around through the pines on
top of the hill, to the cottage.

Sunrise. Hidden by pines and cedars on the east side of the house. Saw
the red flame of it glaring through the cedars, not like sunrise but
like a forest fire. From the window of the front room, then he, the Sun
(can hardly be conceived as other than he), shone silently with solemn
power through the pine branches. Now after High Mass the whole valley is
glorious with morning light and with the song of birds.

It is essential to experience all the times and moods of this place. No
one will know or be able to say how essential. Almost the first and
most important element of a truly spiritual life, lost in the constant,
formal routine of Divine offices under the fluorescent lights in choir --
where there is practically no change between night and day.
