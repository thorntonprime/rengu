Quiet yourself.
Reach out with your mind's skillful hand.
Let it go inside of me
and touch
God.

Don't
be shy, dear.
Every asect of Light we are meant
to know.

The calm hand holds more
than baskets of goods
from the market.

The calm soul knows more
than anything this world
can offer from her
beautiful
womb.
