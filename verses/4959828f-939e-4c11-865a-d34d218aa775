There is no means other than Knowledge for obtaining complete and final
Deliverance; Knowledge alone loosens the bonds of the passions; without
Knowledge, Beatitude (Ananda) cannot be obtained. Action (karma), not being
opposed to ignorance, cannot remove it; but Knowledge disperses ignorance as
light disperses darkness. As soon as ignorance which is born of earthly
affections is removed, the ‘Self’ (Atmâ), by its own splendour, shines afar in
an undivided state, as the sun spreads its brightness abroad when the clouds
have scattered.
