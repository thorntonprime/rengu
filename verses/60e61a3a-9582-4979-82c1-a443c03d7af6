And therefore the divinity always enjoys itself and its own infinite
perfections, seeing it is that eternal and stable sun of goodness that neither
rises nor sets, is neither eclipsed nor can receive any increase of light
and beauty. Hence the divine love is never attended with those turbulent
passions, perturbations, or wrestlings within itself, of fear, desire, grief,
anger, or any such like, whereby our love is wont to explicate and unfold
its affection towards its object. But as the divine love is perpetually most
infinitely ardent and potent, so it is always calm and serene, unchangeable,
having no such ebbings and flowings, no such diversity of stations and
rétrogradations as that love hath in us which ariseth from the weakness
of our understandings, that do not present things to us always in the same
orient lustre and beauty： neither we nor any other mundane thing (all
which are in a perpetual flux) are always the same.
