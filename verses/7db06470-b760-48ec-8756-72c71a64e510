When I said that (men’s) minds were to be emptied of images, it is to
be understood in this sense, that it was just as when you set a
lighted taper at midday in the sunshine, the taper continues to burn,
and sheds forth no less light than it did before： but its light is
lost in the sunshine, because the greater light prevails over the
lesser and absorbs it. so that it no longer seems to shine with a
separate lustre, but is diffused and shed forth in the greater light.
