\‘The city of which we are the founders ... exists in idea only; for I do
not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth.'

‘In heaven,’ I (Socrates) replied, ‘there is laid up a pattern of it,
methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own
house in order. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact,
is no matter; for he (the man of understanding) will live after the manner
of that city, having nothing to do with any other.’
