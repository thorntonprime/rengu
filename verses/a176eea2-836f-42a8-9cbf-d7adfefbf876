Scientists tell us that without the presence of the cohesive force amongst
the atoms that comprise this globe of ours, it would crumble to pieces
and we would cease to exist; and even as there is cohesive force in blind
matter, so must there be in all things animate and tlie name for that
cohesive force among animate beings is Love.
