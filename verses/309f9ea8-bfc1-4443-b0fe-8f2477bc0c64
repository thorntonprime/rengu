Title: Manjusri's Three Threes
---
Manjusri (Wenshu) asked Wuzhu, "What place have you
departed from recently?"

Wuzhu said, "The region of the South."

Jusri said, "So how is the Buddha Dharma kept alive in
the region of the South?"

Zhu said, "Recently, few of the mendicants of the Dharma
respect moral discipline and the rules."

Jusri said, "How many assemblies?"

Zhu said, "Perhaps three hundred, perhaps five hundred."

Wuzhu asked Manjusri, "So how is it kept alive in this
space?"

Jusri said, "The ordinary and sacred reside together,
dragons and snakes mingle."

Zhu said, "How many assemblies?"

Jusri said, "Three threes in front; three
threes in back." (alt. "Previously nine, afterwards nine."

A thousand peaks coil and bend, thus the color blue indigo.

Who says Manjusri was chatting in response?

He was able to laugh, "How many assemblies at Qingliang?"

The three threes in front take part in the three threes in back.
