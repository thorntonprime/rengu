  This expression of religion kniting and uniting the soul to God
  exactly describes the sense of the words yoga and religio.

God made the universe and all the creatures contained therein, as so
many glasses wherein he might reflect his own glory： he hath copied
forth himself in the creation; and in this outward world we may read
the lovely characters of the divine goodness, power and wisdom. In
some creatures there are darker representations of God. there are the
prints and footsteps of God; but in others there are clearer and
fuller representations of the Divinity, the face and image of God;
according to that known saying of the schoolmen. Remotiores
similitudines creaturae ad Deum dicuntur vestigium; propinquiores verá
imago. But how to find God here, and feelingly to converse with him,
and being affected with the sense of the divine glory shining out upon
the creation, how to pass out of the sensible world into the
intellectual, is not so effectually taught by that philosophy which
professed it most, as by true religion： that which knits and unites
God and the soul together, can best teach it how to ascend and
descend upon those golden links that unite, as it were, the world to
God. That divine wisdom that contrived and beautified this glorious
structure, can best explain her own art, and carry up the soul back
again in these reflected beams to him who is the fountain of them.
