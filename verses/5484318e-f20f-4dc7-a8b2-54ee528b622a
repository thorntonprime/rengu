Commentary: |
  The beauty and the skull are two parts of a single reality. In birth, nothing
  is added. In death, nothing is lost The only thing that has changed is form,
  which is in a constant state of becoming. Can‘t you hear the words being
  carried by the wind across the tall grasses? If not, know that you must
  learn to hear beyond the verge of sound.

Every time
the winds of autumn blow,
my eyes are painful, painful ...
Don‘t say it's Ono --
the pampas grass is growing.
