Title: If I Hope to Know You
---
I must seek an unknowing
that is not a lack but

my only gain, taking me
beyond the press

of demands and desires
to an emptiness

where there is room for
You to be born

beyond all that I demand
to know and desire

to find, for You birth
Your Word in the space

of my silence and burn
as light in my dark.
