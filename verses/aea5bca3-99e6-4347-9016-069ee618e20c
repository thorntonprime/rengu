Title: An Enthusiasm to Express Discovery
Description: June 19
---
Some painters were engaged in a passionate conversation about the value of art.

It was an interesting discussion that I listened to almost an hour without
 speaking.

Then a young woman turned to me and said, “Any comments, Hafiz?” And these
 thoughts came to mind that I spoke：

The greatest and most lasting art, the impetus of it, I feel, always comes from
 a wanting to help. A wanting to free, and an enthusiasm to express discovery.

Each soul at some point will begin to feel all is within it and then attends,
 as it were, to its own inner world. That attendance may not result in anything
 considered tangible reaching the masses.

But the artist also becomes aware of inner spheres and mingles with them, and
 then puts those experiences into what they most care about for the world to see
 and touch if the world wants.

I know all my poems come from a wanting to give something useful.
