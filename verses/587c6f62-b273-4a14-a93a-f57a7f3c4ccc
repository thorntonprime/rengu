Charity is in the heart of man, and righteousness is the path for men. Pity the
man who has lost his path and does not follow it and who has lost his heart and
does not know how to recover it. When peopleâ€™s dogs and chicks are lost, they
go out and look for them, and yet the people who have lost their hearts (or
original nature) do not go out and look for them. The principle of
self-cultivation consists in nothing but trying to look for the lost heart. ...

Now a man is wise enough to be ashamed of a finger that is not normal, and yet
he is not wise enough to be ashamed of his heart, when his heart is not normal.
We say such a man has no sense of the relative importance of things.
