Title: Birdsong from Inside the Egg
---
There is an excess
in spiritual searching
that is profound ignorance.

Let that ignorance be our teacher.
The Friend breathes into one
who has no breath.

A deep silence revives the listening
and the speaking of those two
who meet on the riverbank.

Like the ground turning green in a spring wind,
like birdsong beginning inside the egg.

Like this universe coming into existence,
the lover wakes, and whirls
in a dancing joy,

then kneels down
in praise.
