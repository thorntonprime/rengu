Title: I Don't Know
---
Whose footfall is the Paulowina leaf rippling through the still air?

Whose face is the blue sky peeping through the dark clouds
  driven by the zephyr at the rainy season's end?

Whose breath is the unknown fragrance flowing
  through the green moss
in the deep, flowerless woods and brushing the quiet sky
  above the old pagoda?

Whose song is the delicately flowing stream of unknown source
  splashing against the stones?

Whose poetry is the glow that adorns the setting sun,
  with its jadelike hands caressing the endless sky
and its lotuslike heels that cross
  over the boundless ocean?

After burning, embers become fuel again.
Whose faint lamp is my heart, burning for reason unknown
  through the night?
