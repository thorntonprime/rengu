Title: Bodhidharma's Empty Thus
---
Emperor Wu of Liang asked great master Damo, "So, what is
the primary meaning of the holy truths?"

Mo said, "Empty thus, without holiness."

The Emperor said, "Who is this one opposing us?"

Mo said, "Don't know."

The Emperor did not concur. Damo proceeded to cross over
the river and arrived at the kingdom of Wei.

Afterwards the Emperor brought it up and asked the Official
of the Annals. The Official of the Annals said, "Does Your Highness
still deny knowing this person?"

The Emperor said, "Don't know."

The Official of the Annals said, "This is the Great-being
Guanyin (Mahasattva Avalokitevara.) transmitting the imprint of the
Buddha's Heart-Mind."

The Emperor regretted and proceeded to dispatch a messenger
to go and beseech . The Official of the Annals said,
"Your Highness do not say to send out a messenger to go fetch him. The
people of the entire nation could go, and he still would not return."
