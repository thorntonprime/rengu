The Nembutsu may be practised whether one is walking, standing, sitting or
lying, and so it may be left with everyone, according to circumstances,
to do it either reclining or sitting or in any way he chooses. And as to
holding the rosary or putting on the sacred scarf, this too must be decided
according to circumstances. The main point is not the outward manner at all,
but the fixing of one's mind on the one thing, firmly determining to have
Ôjô, and with all seriousness to call upon the sacred name. This is the
all-important thing.
