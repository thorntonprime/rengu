\"Compare the area within the four seas with all that is between heaven
and earth - is it not like one little anthill in a vast marsh? Compare
the Middle Kingdom with the area within the four seas - is it not like
one tiny grain in a great storehouse? When we refer to the things of
creation, we speak of them as numbering ten thousand - and man is only
one of them. We talk of the Nine Provinces where men are most numerous,
and yet of the whole area where grain and foods are grown and where
boats and carts pass back and forth, man occupies only one fraction.
Compared to the ten thousand things, is he not like one little hair on
the body of a horse? What the Five Emperors passed along, what the
Three Kings fought over, what the benevolent man grieves about, what
the responsible man labors over - all is no more than this!  Po Yi
gained a reputation by giving it up; Confucius passed himself off as
learned because he talked about it. But in priding themselves in this
way, were they not like you a moment ago priding yourself on your flood
waters?"
