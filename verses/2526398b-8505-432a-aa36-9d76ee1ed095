  - Combat-Action=Symbolism=The Manifold Content of Symbols
By: Muhammad
Commentary: |
  This hadith even, like many others, lends itself to a plurality of
  interpretations, since the Arabic ahruf can mean both ‘letters’
  (referring here to seven standard styles of pronunciation) and
  ‘limits' (referring to a superposition of senses). Sacred languages,
  in fact, like Arabic, Hebrew, or Sanskrit, both written and spoken,
  are eminent vehicles of higher realities, and their symbolic content
  extends beyond the science of etymologies to the very letters
  themselves and their numerical equivalents (gemalria), -- even their
  shapes. Greek and Latin, while not directly revealed languages, still
  retain a highly rational and logical character with an intellectual
  basis which carries down into later European language structures. At
  the other extreme (barring certain monstrosities like Esperanto) is
  modern usage, which tends in its exaggerated forms to exalt the purely
  emotional content of words, ‘existentially’, in terms of tensions,
  forces and reactions bordering upon an infra-rational intuitionism,
  and where the ‘intellectual’ content is practically limited to the
  pedantic Latin and Greek coinages for chemical processes and
  pharmaceutical products.
