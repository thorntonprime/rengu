My heart has become capable of every form： it is a pasture for gazelles and a
 convent for Christian monks.
And a temple for idols, and the pilgrim’s Ka'ba, and the tables of the Tora and
 the book of the Koran.
I follow the religion of Love, whichever way his camels take. My religion and
 my faith is the true religion.
