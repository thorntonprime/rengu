LEAR. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?

KENT. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that
will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him
that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot
choose, and to eat no fish.

LEAR. What are thou?

KENT. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

LEAR. If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a king, thou art poor
enough. What wouldst thou?

KENT. Service.

LEAR. Whom wouldst thou serve?

KENT. You.

LEAR. Dost thou know me, fellow?

KENT. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain
call master.

LEAR. What’s that?

KENT. Authority.
