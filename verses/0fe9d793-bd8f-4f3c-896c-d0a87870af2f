Title: The Surangama's Not Seeing
---
The ragama Stra says, When I do not see, why dont
seeing, intrinsically that is not the characteristic of not seeing. If
an object, why say is not you?

The whole elephant and the whole ox  are not different from cataracts.

Those who act in accord with what comes share the names and patterns.

So now wanting to see the yellow-headed elder ,

Every grain of dust of every realm is half the way
