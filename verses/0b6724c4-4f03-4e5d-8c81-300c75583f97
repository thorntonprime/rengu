Title: Inward Sky
Description: August 20-21
---
You are the soul, the universe,
and what animates the universe.

I live and work inside you. I speak with
what was found in the ruins of a former self.

Concealed in your garden, I have become a ladder
propped against and leading up into the sky-dome.

Why cry for what is closer than voice?
I ask to hear the wisdom that uncovers the soul.

These four come with their answers.

Fire： You have a saucepan to cook what's raw.
Wear it like a saddle on your back.

Water： You have a spring inside.
Soak the earth.

Jupiter in the goodluck aspect： Show your talent,
Do something outside of time and space.

Jupiter in its bad mood： Be consumed with jealousy.
What else is there?

Prophets come and go for one reason, to say,

Human beings, you have a great value
inside your form, a seed. Be led
by the rose inside the rose.

Doubt is part of existence.
There is no proof of the soul.

So I ask in this talking with soul,
this prayer, this kindness, When the soul
leaves my body, where will these poems be?

Answer： It was like that in the beginning,
so what are you worrying about?

Love, finish this ghazal, please.
You know which words will last.

Shams, say the meaning of the names,
the inward sky that you are.
