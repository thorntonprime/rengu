Those outflows whereby, if they had not been extinguished, I might have been a
deva, gandharva, yakkha or a human being -- those outflows are extinguished in
me, cut off at the root, made like a palm-tree stump that can come to no
further existence in the future. ...

  As a lotus, fair and lovely,
  By the water is not soiled,
  By the world am I not soiled;
  Therefore, brahmin, am I Buddha.
