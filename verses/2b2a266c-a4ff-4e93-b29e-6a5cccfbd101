The baptism of Allâh is the dyeing-vat of Hu (‘He’, the Supreme Self)：
 therein all piebald things become of one colour.
When he (the contemplative) falls into the vat, and you say to him,
 ‘Arise,’ he says in rapture, ‘I am the vat： do not blame me.’
That ‘I am the vat’ is the same as saying ‘I am God’： he has the
 colour of the fire, albeit he is iron.
The colour of the iron is naughted in the colour of the fire： it (the iron)
 boasts of its fieriness, though actually it is like one who keeps silence.
When it has become like gold of the mine in redness, then without tongue
 its boast is ‘I am the fire.’
It has become glorified by the colour and nature of the fire： it says,
 ‘I am the fire, I am the fire.’ ...
What fire? What iron? Close your lips： do not laugh at the beard of the
 assimilator’s simile.
