Now I have no doubt that it is obvious to a man of sound mind that the first
thing the voice of the first speaker uttered was the equivalent of God,
namely El, whether in the way of a question or in the way of an answer. It
seems absurd and repugnant to reason that anything should have been named by
man before God, since man had been made by him and for him. For as, since
the transgression of the human race, every one begins his first attempt at
speech with a cry of woe, it is reasonable that he who existed before that
transgression should begin with joy; and since there is no joy without God,
but all joy is in God, and God himself is wholly joy, it follows that the
first speaker said first and before anything else 'God'.
