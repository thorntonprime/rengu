Love, like the Spirit of God, rideth upon the wings of the wind, and is in
union and communion with all the saints that are in Heaven and on earth. Love
is quite pure; it has no by-ends; it seeks not its own; it has but one will,
and that is to give itself into everything and overcome all evil with good.
Lastly, love is the Christ of God; it comes down from Heaven; it regenerates
the soul from above; it blots out all transgressions; it takes from death its
sting, from the devil his power, and from the serpent his poison. It heals all
the infirmities of our earthly birth; it gives eyes to the blind, ears to the
deaf, and makes the dumb to speak; it cleanses the lepers and casts out devils,
and puts man in Paradise before he dies.
