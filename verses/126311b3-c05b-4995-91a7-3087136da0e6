Title: The Sign Of Virtue Complete

Confucius said, "If you look at them from the point of view of their
differences, then there is liver and gall, Ch'u and Yueh. But if you
look at them from the point of view of their sameness, then the ten
thousand things are all one. A man like this doesn't know what his ears
or eyes should approve - he lets his mind play in the harmony of
virtue. As for things, he sees them as one and does not see their loss.
He regards the loss of a foot as a lump of earth thrown away."
