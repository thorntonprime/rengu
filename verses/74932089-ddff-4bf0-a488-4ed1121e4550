Use this practice to bring wisdom to a situation of inner or outer conflict.
Initially begin by sitting. Later you can practice in social situations.

Sit quietly and easily, focusing on your breath or body. When you feel settled,
bring to mind a time ten years ahead. Recognize that you don’t know what
will happen then. Feel the not knowing and relax with it. Think of the earth
spinning through space with hundreds of thousands of people being born and
dying every day. Where does each life come from? How did it start? There
are so many things we don’t know. Feel the truth of don’t know mind,
relax and become comfortable with it.

Now, bring to mind a conflict, inner or outer. Be aware of all the thoughts
and opinions you have about how it should be, about how they should be.
Now recognize that you don’t really know. Maybe the wrong thing will lead
to something better. You don’t know.

Consider how would it be to approach yourself, the situation, the other
people with don’t know mind. Feel it. Don’t know. Not sure. No fixed
opinion. Allow yourself to want to understand anew. Approach it with don’t
know mind. With openness. How does don’t know mind affect the situation?
Does it improve it, make it wiser, easier? More relaxed?

Practice don’t know mind until you are comfortable resting in uncertainty,
until you can do your best and laugh and say “Don’t know.”
