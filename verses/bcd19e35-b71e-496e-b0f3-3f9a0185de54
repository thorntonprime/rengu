Title: In The World Of Men

\"I want to tell you something else I have learned. In all human
relations, if the two parties are living close to each other, they may
form a bond through personal trust. But if they are far apart, they
must use words to communicate their loyalty, and words must be
transmitted by someone. To transmit words that are either pleasing to
both parties or infuriating to both parties is one of the most
difficult things in the world. Where both parties are pleased, there
must be some exaggeration of the good points; and where both parties
are angered, there must be some exaggeration of the bad points.
Anything that smacks of exaggeration is irresponsible. Where there is
irresponsibility, no one will trust what is said, and when that
happens, the man who is transmitting the words will be in danger.
Therefore the aphorism says, `Transmit the established facts; do not
transmit words of exaggeration.' If you do that, you will probably come
out all right.
