Our Lady said： ‘Take this gold coin. It is thine own will. Offer it
in all things to my Lord and Son."

In deep modesty and holy awe the little maid received the great coin.
She looked at it and saw that on one side it bore the Descent from the
Cross, on the other the whole Kingdom of Heaven with the nine choirs
and above them the Throne of God. Then God’s voice spoke to her, ‘If
thou offer Me this coin so that thou wilt never take it back, then
will I loose thee from the Cross and bring thee to Me in My Kingdom.’
