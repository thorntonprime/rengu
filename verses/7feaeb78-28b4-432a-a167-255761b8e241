Put a fish on land and he will remember the ocean until he dies. Put a bird
in a cage, yet he will not forget the sky. Each remains homesick for his
true home, the place where his nature has decreed that he should be.

Man is born in the state of innocence. His original nature is love and
grace and purity. Yet he emigrates so casually without even a thought of
his old home. Is this not sadder than the fishes and the birds?
