This medicine is the 'Calling upon the Name of Amida’, and it is wrapped
up in the six syllables Na Mu A Mi Da Butsu. It means absolute concentration
on Amida’s name. ... For this medicine no capital or special wisdom is
needed. All one has to do is to recite the words with your mouth. ... Here
indeed is a pivot of fundamental power.

Do I hear you say ‘Too easy'? 'Such wares are intended only to deceive
old men and women.' Many doubt their efficacy and ask of the wise if there
is not some other way more suited for clever people. And Sakyamuni pointed
straight back at the heart of man and said that within one's own heart there
is to be found the true Buddha nature.
