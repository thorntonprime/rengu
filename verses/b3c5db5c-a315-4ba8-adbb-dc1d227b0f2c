Sun's yang light failing, down the Western Peak;
the grasses caught the light, and flowered with it.
And again, the dark came on, moon waiting like a
 hidden dragon,
among the intertwining branches of vine-covered
 pines.
Here, just here, a tiger waited,
bristling, hackles up, to meet me.
Not a pen knife in my hand,
I tried, I tried to know no fear,
but my heart was all ears, all ears.
