It is very often said that the soul cannot be pure unless she is reduced to her
original simplicity, the state God created her in; just as from copper gold
cannot be made by two or three roastings, it must be reduced to its elemental
nature. Things which melt on heating and solidify on cooling are purely of a
watery nature. They must therefore be turned back again to water and get quite
rid of their present nature. Thus heaven and science conspire to transmute it
into gold. We can counterfeit silver with iron and with copper gold; the more
like the more false, without riddance. It is the same with the soul. Virtues
are easy to talk of, easy to feign, but to have them really is extremely rare.
