Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
The sage is still not because he takes stillness to be good and
therefore is still. The ten thousand things are insufficient to
distract his mind - that is the reason he is still. Water that is still
gives back a clear image of beard and eyebrows; reposing in the water
level, it offers a measure to the great carpenter. And if water in
stillness possesses such clarity, how much more must pure spirit. The
sage's mind in stillness is the mirror of Heaven and earth, the glass
of the ten thousand things.
