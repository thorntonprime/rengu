Death cometh into him from every side while yet he cannot die, and
before him is a harsh doom.

A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord： Their works are
as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no
control of aught that they have earned. That is the extreme failure.
