We sit here as the great Council of the King, and in that capacity, it is
our duty to take into consideration the state and affairs of the kingdom,
and when there is occasion, to give a true representation of them by way of
counsel and advice, with what we conceive necessary or expedient to be done.

In this consideration, I confess many a sad thought hath affrighted me,
and that not only in respect of our dangers from abroad (which yet I
know are great, as they have been often prest and dilated to us), but in
respect of our disorders here at home, which do enforce those dangers,
and by which they are occasioned, For I believe I shall make it clear to
you, that both at first, the cause of these dangers were our disorders,
and our disorders now are yet our greatest dangers -- that not so much
the potency of our enemies as the weakness of ourselves, doth threaten
us： ... Our want of true devotion to heaven -- our insincerity and
doubting in religion -- our want of councils -- our precipitate
actions -- the insufficiency or unfaithfulness of our generals abroad --
the ignorance or corruption of our ministers at home -- the impoverishing
of the sovereign -- the oppression and depression of the subject -- the
exhausting of our treasures -- the waste of our provisions -- consumption
of our ships -destruction of our men -- these make the advantage to our
enemies, not the reputation of their arms; and if in these there be not
reformation, we need no foes abroad： Time itself will ruin us.
