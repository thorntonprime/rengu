Title: Stranded Somewhere
---
If you are the body, that one is the soul
of the universe. If you are the soul,
that one is the soul within all souls.

Wherever you go, whatever you are, listen for the voice
that asks. Who will be sacrificed tonight?

Jump up then and volunteer. Accept
the cup that is offered every second.

If you are bored and contemptuous,
love is a walk in a meadow.
If you are stranded somewhere,
love is an Arabian horse.

The ocean feeds itself to its fish.
If you are an ocean fish, why bother
with bread the ground grows?

These jars of grief and trouble
that we call bodies, throw stones and break them.

My cage is this longing for Shams.
Be my worst enemy. Shatter it.
