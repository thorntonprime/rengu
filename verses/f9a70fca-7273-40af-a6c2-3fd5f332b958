Title: Yunmen's Brightness of Light

Yunmen said in handing down words, "In every last person
there is the brightness of light. When looking, it is unseen endless
darkness. How do you make it live, this brightness of light of all
people?"

Substituting for himself, he said, "The kitchen
storehouse, the triple gate."

Again he said, "Good things are not as good as nothing."


Shining by itself, the solitary brightness lines up

And flows unobstructed a single thread for you.

The flowers wither; the tree is without a shadow.

When looking, who does not see?

Seeing is not seeing.

Backwards astride the ox, ahh!, to enter the Buddha sanctuary.
