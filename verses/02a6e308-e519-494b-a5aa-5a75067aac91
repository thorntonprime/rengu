Live in the wisdom of the life of God,
that with it thou mayest be ordered to his glory,
and order his creatures to his glory.

Be still and silent from thy own wisdom, wit, craft, subtilty, or policy
that would arise in thee,
but stand single to the Lord,
without any end to thyself.

God will bless thee and prosper thee in his ways;
thou wilt feel his blessing in thy generation.

And with thy mind stayed upon the Lord,
thou wilt be kept in a perfect peace,
without any intent to thyself,
to the glory of God.

And there wilt thou feel no want,
nor never a failing, nor forsaking,
but the presence of the Lord God of life with thee.
