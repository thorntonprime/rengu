Title: A Poetry Workshop
---
If I ever gave a poetry workshop here are some key factors I would elaborate
 upon, hoping to give you your money’s worth.

* Watch out for the word flower. It can be lethal.
* Be equally on your guard for the word rainbow and its-for the most
 part-assault on serious literature.
* And the words butterfly or star, I love them, but I think they are best left
 off the page unless you are desperate, and/or have not yet reached puberty.

That about rounds out the general holy trinity of don’ts in poems, from
 my perspective.
And if you ever succumb to using the word flower, rainbow, or the b or s
 word more than twice in one book, unless it is very cleverly done-well,
well, you should really invite someone to shoot you.
