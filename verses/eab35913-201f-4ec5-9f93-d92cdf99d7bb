Title: Prophets
By: A.C. Newman
---
was a silent partner, I found
myself with the rabble who stood on the mount
Hipshot, thinking but not out loud
There are too many prophets here

On the unbroken side of the stab in the dark
I took it to silence I took it to heart
I carried it quietly over the wall
there were too many prophets there
I was behind it

One high, One High, One High One
One high One High One High One
Strike on Zero
Strike on Zero

I was the silent prophet the words
and I was given to flexion? reflection?
here is my heart and here is my song
there are too many prophets here

I was divided?

One high, one high, one high one
One high, one high, one high one
Strike on Zero
Strike on Zero

I was a silent partner I know
The part of the forest where you shouldn't go
Now out of the woods and out in the day
I see there's too many prophets here

One High, One High, One High One
Strike on zero
One High, One High, One High one
Strike on zero
One High, One High, One High one
Strike on zero

One High, One High, One High one
