(There is) one main characteristical distinction between the prophetical
and pseudoprophetical spirit, viz. That the prophetical spirit doth never
alienate the mind, (seeing it seats itself as well in the rational as in the
sensitive powers.) but always maintains a consistency and clearness of reason,
strength, and solidity of judgment, where it comes; it doth not ravish the
mind, but inform and enlighten it; but the pseudo-prophetical spirit, if
indeed without any kind of dissimulation it enters into any one, because
it can rise no higher than the middle region of man, which is his fancy,
it there dwells as in storms and tempests, and being ἄλογον τι in
itself, is also conjoined with alienations and abruptions of mind.
