Every one thirsts for peace, but few people understand that perfect peace
cannot be obtained so long as the inner soul is not filled with the presence
of God, ... this God who is always present in all the fibres of your body and
who none the less prefers to remain hidden. When through appropriate and
assiduous exercises the blackness of your soul is effaced, God reveals
Himself, and it is absolute peace.
