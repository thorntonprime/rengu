\‘The thing needed,’ said Kung-ni, ‘is abstinence of the heart.’

‘And what is that?’ asked Yen-hui.

‘It is this,’ said Kung-ni： ‘to concentrate all one’s intellectual energy as
into a mass. Not to listen with the ears, or with the heart, but with the
spirit alone. To intercept the way of the senses, to keep the mirror of the
heart pure, to let the spirit occupy itself, in the inner void, with abstract
objects alone. The vision of principle demands the void. To keep oneself void,
that is abstinence of the heart One must stay closed, simple, in a natural
purity, without artifical admixture. Thus one can manage to remain without
emotion, while it is difficult to become calm again after having let oneself be
moved, just as it is easier not to walk, than to efface one’s tracks after
having walked.
