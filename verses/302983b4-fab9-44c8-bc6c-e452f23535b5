You never enjoy the world aright, till the Sea itself floweth in your veins,
till you are clothed with the heavens, and crowned with the stars; and perceive
yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world, and more than so, because men
are in it who are every one sole heirs as well as you. Till you can sing and
rejoice and delight in God, as misers do in gold, and Kings in sceptres, you
never enjoy the world.

Till your spirit filleth the whole world, and the stars are your jewels; till
you are as familiar with the ways of God in all Ages as with your walk and
table; till you are intimately acquainted with that shady nothing out of which
the world was made; till you love men so as to desire their happiness, with a
thirst equal to the zeal of your own; till you delight in God for being good to
all; you never enjoy the world.
