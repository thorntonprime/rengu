Being that has soul is living being. Soul is the living thing in man, that
which lives of itself and causes life. Therefore God breathed into Adam a
living breath, that he might live. With her cunning play of illusions the
soul lures into life the inertness of matter that does not want to live. She
makes us believe incredible things, that life may be lived. She is full
ofsnares and traps, in order that man should fall, should reach the earth,
entangle himselfthere, and stay caught, so that life should be lived; as
Eve in the garden of Eden could not rest content until she had convinced
Adam of the goodness of the forbidden apple. Were it not for the leaping
and twinkling of the soul, man would rot away in his greatest passion,
idleness. A certain kind of reasonableness is its advocate, and a certain
kind of morality adds its blessing. But to have soul is the whole venture
oflife, for soul is a life-giving daemon who plays his elfin game above and
below human existence, for which reason -- in t he realm of dogma -- he is
threatened and propitiated with superhuman punishments and blessings that
go far beyond the possible deserts ofhuman beings. Heaven and hell are the
fates meted out to the soul and not to civilized man, who in his nakedness and
timidity would have no idea of what to do with himselfin a heavenly Jerusalem.
