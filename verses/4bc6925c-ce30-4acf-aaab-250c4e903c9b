For Gods Conjunctions Man maie not undoe.
But if his Grace fully consent thereto.
By helpe of this Science, which our Lord above
Hath given to such Men as he doth love;
Wherefore old Fathers conveniently
Called this Science Holy AIkimy.
  Therefore noe Man shulde be too swifte.
To cast away our Lords blessed guiftï¼š
Consideringe how that Almighty God
From great Doctours hath this Science forbod.
And graunted it to few Men of his mercy.
Such as be faithfull trew and lowly.
