Pure aesthetic experience is theirs in whom the knowledge of ideal beauty is
innate; it is known intuitively, in intellectual ecstasy without accompaniment
of ideation, at the highest level of conscious being; born of one mother with
the vision of God, its life is as it were a flash of blinding light of
transmundane origin, impossible to analyze, and yet in the image of our very
being.
