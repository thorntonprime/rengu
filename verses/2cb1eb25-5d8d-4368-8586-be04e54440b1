Title: Jealous Hearing Someone Laugh
---
Have you ever felt jealous hearing someone laugh? And then began to think
 to yourself,
“Why am I so caught in the world’s snare? Why don’t I know right now
 the freedom
in other voices when their spirit like an arrow takes flight above the
 hour’s concern?”
But the heart’s laughter is never there to taunt another, especially if
 the other is feeling low.
Real laughter is a waving, a beckoning, a message, a calling to all that says,
Over here, come over here for a minute ... where things look so diff erent,
 and you can have more fun!
