What cannot be seen is called indistinguishable.
What cannot be heard is called indistinct.
What cannot be touched is called indefinite.
The three can’t be comprehended
So they’re confused and considered one.
Its surface is not bright.
Its depths are not obscured.
Dimly seen it can’t be named
So returns to the insubstantial.
This is the shapeless shape,
The form without substance.
This is called blurred and shadowy.
Approach it you can’t see its face.
Follow it you can’t see its back.
Hold fast to the ancient Way
In order to control the present.
Knowing the source of the ancient,
Is the thread that runs through the Way.
