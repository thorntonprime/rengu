  Specifically, the Qur'ân; generally speaking, divine inspiration
  established integrally and immutably in the being, which presupposes the
  profound serenity of a fully receptive and acquiescent soul.

Lo! We revealed it in the Night of Power.
And what can convey unto thee what the Night of Power is!
The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.
The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by permission of their Lord, from
  the source of all decrees.
Peace it is until the break of dawn.
