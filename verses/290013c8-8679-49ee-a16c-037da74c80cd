Listen, listen more carefully to what is around you
right now.

In my world there are bells from the clanks
of the morning milk drums

and a wagon wheel outside my window just hit a
bump,

which turned into an ecstatic chorus of the Beloved's
Name.

And there is the Prayer Call rising up like the sun
out of the mouths of a thousand birds.

There is an astonishing vastness of movement and
life emanating sound and light

from my folded hands, and my even quieter simple
being and heart.

My dear, is it true that your mind is sometimes like
a battering ram

running all through the city and the villages
shouting

so madly inside and out about the hundreds of things
that do not matter?
