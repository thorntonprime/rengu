Title: Survival of the Soul
---
What more can we accomplish now than the survival of the soul. Harm
and decay are not more present than before, perhaps, only more
apparent, more visible and measurable. For the harm which humanity
has lived daily since the beginning cannot be increased. But there is
increasing insight into humanity's capacity for unspeakable harm, and
perhaps where it leads. So much in collapse, so much seeking new ways
out. Room for what new can happen.
