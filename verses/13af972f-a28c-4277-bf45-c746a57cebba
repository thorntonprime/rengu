Title: Yunmen's Hedge
---
A monk asked Yunmen, "So what is the pure Dharmakaya?

Men said, "A hedge in bloom."

The monk said, "Then in this way, when the season has
gone what is it like?"

Men said, "A lion with golden fur."

"A hedge in bloom,"

Don't be stupid

The points are on the scale --- not on the pan.

"Then in this way"

Extremely clueless

"A lion with golden fur," great family, observe.
