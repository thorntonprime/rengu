Title: Sheba's Throne II
---
Solomon saw that her heart was open to him
and that the throne would soon be left behind.

Let her bring it, he said.
It will soon become a lesson to her.
She can look at that throne
and see how far she has come.

In the same way God keeps the process
of generation constantly before us.
The smooth skin and the semen,
the wet of desire and the growing embryo.

When you see a pearl on the bottom,
you reach through the foam and the broken sticks
on the surface. When the sun comes up,
you forget about the problem of locating
the constellation of Scorpio.

Inside the splendor of union,
the attractions of duality seem poignant
and lovely, but much less interesting.
