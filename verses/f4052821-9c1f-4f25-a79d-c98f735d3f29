O nobly-born, these realms are not come from somewhere outside (thyself). They
come from within the four divisions of thy heart, which, including its
centre, make the five directions. They issue from within there, and shine
upon thee. The deities, too, are not come from somewhere elseï¼š they exist
from eternity within the faculties of thine own intellect. Know them to be
of that nature.
