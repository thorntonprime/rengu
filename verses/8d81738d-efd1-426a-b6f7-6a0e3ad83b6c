Title: Lion Dance
By: Sengai Gibon
Commentary: |
  - Body: |
      Like Hakuin, Sengai often chose subjects from daily life for
      his paintings. He seems to have especially loved children, who
      often appear in his scrolls, such as this toddler watching a
      “Lion Dance” with total delight. One charming feature that
      Sengai added is the upper face of the performer peeping through
      the break between the costume and the mask. Despite the apparent
      simplicity of the brushwork, we can see the differences in the
      depictions of eyesx -- merely dots for the toddler, more complex
      for the performer, and round and staring on the mask.
