This is a reminderï¼š that verily for the Godfearing is a beautiful place of
return.

Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them,

Wherein, reclining, they call for the plenteous fruit and drink that is
therein.

And with them are chaste-eyed companions.

This is what you are promised on the Day of Reckoning.

Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away
