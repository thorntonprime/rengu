Title: Low-Key
---
Think of all the attention a donkey would get if it started to speak more
 eloquently and make more sense than everyone else for miles around.
With that in mind I hold back a lot. Because I like to fit in, usually. Act
 low-key.
Am I doing so now, appearing normal? It is getting hard sometimes. For God
 keeps oooooooooozing through my cracks.
