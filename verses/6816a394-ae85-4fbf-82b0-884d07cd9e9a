\"From the point of view of differences, if we regard a thing as big
because there is a certain bigness to it, then among all the ten
thousand things there are none that are not big. If we regard a thing
as small because there is a certain smallness to it, then among the ten
thousand things there are none that are not small. If we know that
heaven and earth are tiny grains and the tip of a hair is a range of
mountains, then we have perceived the law of difference.
