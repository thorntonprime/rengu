Before (Pythagoras) the followers of science were called, not philosphers, but
wise men, such as were those seven most ancient sages whose names are still
known to fame; the first of whom was called Solon. ... Pythagoras, being
asked if he called himself a wise man, denied himself that name, and said that
he was not wise, but a lover of wisdom. And thence it happened afterwards that
all students of wisdom were called lovers of wisdom, that is, philosophers; for
philo and sophia in Greek are equivalent to love and wisdom. Whence we may see
that these two words make up the name philosopher, that is to say, lover of
wisdom; which we may observe is not a term of arrogance, but of humility.
