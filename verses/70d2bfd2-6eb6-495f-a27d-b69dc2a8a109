For when we go out in love beyond and above all things, and die to all
observation in ignorance and in darkness, then we are wrought and transformed
through the Eternal Word, Who is the Image of the Father. In this idleness
of our spirit, we receive the Incomprehensible Light, which enwraps us and
penetrates us, as the air is penetrated by the light of the sun. And this
Light is nothing else than a fathomless staring and seeing. What we are,
that we behold; and what we behold, that we are; for our thought, our life,
and our being are uplifted in simplicity, and made one with the Truth which
is God. And therefore in this simple staring we are one life and one spirit
with God.
