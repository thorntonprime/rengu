From Gautama Buddha down through the whole line of patriarchs to Bodhidharma.
none preached aught besides the One Mind, otherwise known as the Sole Vehicle
of Liberation. Hence, though you search throughout the whole universe, you
will never find another vehicle. Nowhere has this teaching leaves or branches;
its one quality is eternal truth. Hence it is a teaching hard to accept.
