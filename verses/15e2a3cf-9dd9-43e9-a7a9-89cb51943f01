As it becometh you to retain a glorious sense of the world, because the
Earth and the Heavens and the Heaven of Heavens are the magnificent and
glorious territories of Godâ€™s Kingdom, so are you to remember always the
unsearchable extent and illimited greatness of your own soul; the length and
breadth and depth, and height of your own understanding. Because it is the
House of God, a Living Temple, and a glorious Throne of the Blessed Trinity;
far more magnificent and great than the Heavens; yea a person that in Union and
Communion with God, is to see Eternity, to fill His Omnipresence, to possess
His greatness, to admire His love; to receive His gifts, to enjoy the world,
and to live in His Image. Let all your actions proceed from a sense of this
greatness, let all your affections extend to this endless wideness, let all
your prayers be animated by this spirit and let ail your praises arise and
ascend from this fountain.
