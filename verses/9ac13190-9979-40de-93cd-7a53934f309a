\"In ancient times Chieh put Kuan Lung-feng to death and Chou put Prince
Pi Kan to death. Both Kuan Lung-feng and Prince Pi Kan were scrupulous
in their conduct, bent down to comfort and aid the common people, and
used their positions as ministers to oppose their superiors. Therefore
their rulers, Chieh and Chou, utilized their scrupulous conduct as a
means to trap them, for they were too fond of good fame. In ancient
times Yao attacked Ts'ung-chih and Hsu-ao, and Yu attacked Yu-hu, and
these states were left empty and unpeopled, their rulers cut down. It
was because they employed their armies constantly and never ceased
their search for gain. All were seekers of fame or gain - have you
alone not heard of them? Even the sages cannot cope with men who are
after fame or gain, much less a person like you!
