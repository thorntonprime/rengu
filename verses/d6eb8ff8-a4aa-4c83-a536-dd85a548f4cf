Since he is like this, his mind forgets; his face is calm; his
forehead is broad. He is chilly like autumn, balmy like spring, and his
joy and anger prevail through the four seasons. He goes along with what
is right for things and no one knows his limit. Therefore, when the
sage calls out the troops, he may overthrow nations but he will not
lose the hearts of the people. His bounty enriches ten thousand ages
but he has no love for men. Therefore he who delights in bringing
success to things is not a sage; he who has affections is not
benevolent; he who looks for the right time is not a worthy man; he who
cannot encompass both profit and loss is not a gentleman; he who thinks
of conduct and fame and misleads himself is not a man of breeding; and
he who destroys himself and is without truth is not a user of men.
Those like Hu Pu-hsieh, Wu Kuang, Po Yi, Shu Ch'i, Chi Tzu, Hsu Yu, Chi
T'o, and Shen-t'u Ti-all of them slaved in the service of other men,
took joy in bringing other men joy, but could not find joy in any joy
of their own.
