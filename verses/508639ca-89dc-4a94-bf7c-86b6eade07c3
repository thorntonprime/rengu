\"He lets his spirit ascend and mount upon the light; with his bodily
form he dissolves and is gone. This is called the Illumination of
Vastness. He lives out his fate, follows to the end his true form, and
rests in the joy of Heaven and earth, while the ten thousand cares melt
away. So all things return to their true form. This is called Muddled
Darkness."
