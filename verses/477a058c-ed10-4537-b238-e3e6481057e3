Title: Becoming Your Face
---
Picture the face of your Beloved becoming your face. And His body
fitting on you like a coat you won't take off again.

Don't move so fast now, when such a rare kiss is being offered. For
what lips can really connect with a body wired to a mind that is
darting about in a manic hurry?

From this new perspective, look inside the Heart you have sought so
long to be near. Try and go deep into it. Is it not your own, and mine
too?

If for a second all that you want was not just radiating from your
softened eyeâ€¦ you best fire me, or maybe try Rumi, or read this again.
