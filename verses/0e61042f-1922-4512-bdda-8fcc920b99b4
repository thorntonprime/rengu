Whose footstep is that paulownia leaf that falls silently in the windless
 air, drawing a perpendicular?
Whose face is that piece of blue sky peeping through the black clouds,
 chased by the west wind after a dreary rain?
Whose breath is that unnameable fragrance, born amid the green moss in
 the flowerless deep forest and trailing over the ancient tower?
Whose song is that winding stream gushing from an unknown source and
 breaking against the rocks?
Whose poem is that twilight that adorns the falling day, treading over
 the boundless sea with lotus feet and caressing the vast sky with jade hands?
The ember becomes oil again.
Ah, for whose night does this feeble lantern keep vigil, the unquenchable
 flame in my heart?
