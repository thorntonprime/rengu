If only for once it were still.
If the not-quite-right and the why-this
could be muted, and the neighbor's laughter,
and the static my senses make --
if all of it didn't keep me from coming awake --

Then in one vast thousandfold thought
I could think you up to where thinking ends.

I could possess you,
even for the brevity of a smile,
to offer you
to all that lives,
in gladness.
