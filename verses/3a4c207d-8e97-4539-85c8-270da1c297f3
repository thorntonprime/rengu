The Emperor Wu of Liang invited the Mahasattva Fu to speak on the Diamond
Sutra. Fu took the high seat, shook the lectern once, and descended. The
Emperor was astonished.

Chih-kung asked, " Your Majesty, do you understand?"

The Emperor said, " I don't understand."

Chih-kung said, " The Mahasattva Fu has expounded the Sutra."
