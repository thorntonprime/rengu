This vast egg, compounded of the elements, and resting on the waters, was the
excellent natural abode of Vishnu in the form of Brahmâ, and there Vishnu, the
lord of the universe, whose essence is inscrutable, assumed a perceptible form,
and even he himself abided in it in the character of Brahmâ. Its womb, vast as
the mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains; and the mighty oceans were
the waters that filled its cavity. In that egg were the continents and seas and
mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe, the gods, demons, and
mankind.
