Children, that peace which is found in the spirit and the inner life is well
worth our care, for in that peace lies the satisfaction of all our wants. In
it the Kingdom of God is discovered and His righteousness is found. This peace
a man should allow nothing to take from him, whatever betide, come weal or
woe, honour or shame.
