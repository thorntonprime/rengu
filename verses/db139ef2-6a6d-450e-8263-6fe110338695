Confucius said, "In the world, there are two great decreesï¼š one is fate
and the other is duty." That a son should love his parents is fate-you
cannot erase this from his heart. That a subject should serve his ruler
is duty - there is no place he can go and be without his ruler, no
place he can escape to between heaven and earth. These are called the
great decrees. Therefore, to serve your parents and be content to
follow them anywhere-this is the perfection of filial piety. To serve
your ruler and be content to do anything for him-this is the peak of
loyalty. And to serve your own mind so that sadness or joy do not sway
or move it; to understand what you can do nothing about and to be
content with it as with fate-this is the perfection of virtue. As a
subject and a son, you are bound to find things you cannot avoid. If
you act in accordance with the state of affairs and forget about
yourself, then what lesiure will you have to love life and hate death?
Act in this way and you will be all right.
