Title: Reality and the Ordinary
---
Still very cold and bright.

The best thing about the retreat has been working in the pig barn and then
walking back alone, a mile and a half, through the snow.

I think I have come to see more clearly and more seriously the meaning, or
lack of meaning, in my life. How much I am still the same self-willed and
volatile person who made such a mess of Cambridge. That I have not changed
yet, down in the depths, or, perhaps yes, I have changed radically somewhere,
yet I have still kept some of the old, vain, inconstant, self~centered ways
of looking at things. And that the situation I am in now has been given me to
change me, ifI will only surrender completely to reality as it is given me by
God and no longer seek in any way to evade it, even by interior reservations.

Here at the hermitage, in deep snow, everything is ordinary and silent. Return
to reality and to the ordinary, in silence. It is always there, if you know
enough to return to it.

What is not ordinary -- the tension of meeting people, discussion, ideas. This
too is good and real, but illusion gets into it.The unimportant becomes
iniportant. Words and images become more important than life.

One travels all over vast areas, sitting still in a room, and one is soon
tired ot‘so much traveling.

I need very much this silence and this snow. Here alone can I find my way
because here alone the way is right in front of my face and it is God’s
way for me -- there really is no other.
