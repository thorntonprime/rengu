What, ultimately, is the difference between hardship and pleasure? A
hardship is an obstacle and an obstacle is a challenge and a challenge is a
way to use one’s Dharma strength. What is more pleasurable than that?

People are always so afraid of hardship. They go through life trying to
avoid the difficult and embrace the easy. For me, it’s just the opposite. I
don’t discriminate at all between hardship and pleasure. Whether the path
ahead of me is difficult or easy, I don’t have hesitate to follow it.
