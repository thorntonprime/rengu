Now, it has elsewhere been said： ‘Verily, there are two Brahmas to be
meditated upon： sound and non-sound. Now, non-sound is revealed only by
sound." Now, in this case the sound-Brahma is Om. Ascending by it, one comes
to an end in the non-sound. So one says： ‘This, indeed, is the way. This
is immortality. This is complete union (sâyujyatva) and also peacefulness
(nirvrtatva).'

Now, as a spider mounting up by means of his thread (tantu) obtains free
space, thus, assuredly, indeed, does that meditator, mounting up by means
of Om, obtain independence (svâtantrya).
