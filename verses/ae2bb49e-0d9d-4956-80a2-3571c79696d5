Commentary: 'This is ''the cool of the day'' in Genesis, III. 8. The
  first Adam''s

  propensity towards dispersion is released by the Light''s withdrawal;
  with

  the second Adam the image is reversed, -- the mystery of the Fall
  and

  Redemption, as adumbrated in the passages closing the present chapter.

Certainly he (the first man) was created of flesh and blood, but of a
flesh and blood both immutable and perpetual. ... This matter was real,
but in the same way that shadows are latent in the light, which does not
alter their inability to manifest themselves in the presence of this light;
but when the light is extinguished the shadows appear.
