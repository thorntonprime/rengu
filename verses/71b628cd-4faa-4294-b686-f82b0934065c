Religion, where it is in truth and in power, renews the very spirit of our
minds, and doth in a manner spiritualize this outward creation to us. ... Every
particular good is a blossom of the first goodness; every created excellency is
a beam from the Father of Lights; and should we separate all these
particularities from God, all affection spent upon them would be unchaste, and
their embraces adulterous. We should love all things in God, and God in all
things, because he is all in all, the beginning and original of being, the
perfect idea of their goodness, and the end of their motion. ...

Thus may a good man walk up and down the world as in a garden of spices, and
suck a divine sweetness out of every flower. ... And seeing God hath never
thrown the world from himself, but runs through all created essence, containing
the archetypal ideas of all things in himself, and from thence deriving and
imparting several prints of beauty and excellency all the world over; a soul
that is truly OeoctSys, godlike, a mind that is enlightened from the same
fountain, and hath its inward senses affected with the sweet relishes of divine
goodness, cannot but every where behold itself in the midst of that glorious
unbounded Being who is indivisibly everywhere. A good man finds every place he
treads upon holy ground; to him the world is God’s temple; he is ready to say
with Jacob, ‘How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of
God.’
