To pursue what's known, learn ever more each day.
To pursue the Way, do ever less each day.

Release. Renounce. Let go. Divest.
Fill every moment with less and less.
And when at last nothing is done,
then nothing also is left undone.

The world will not be ruled by intervening.
Follow nature's course to seek its meaning.
