  Waley says this endearing and enduring vision “can be understood in the
  past, present, or future tense, as the reader desires.” This is always
  true of the vision of the golden age, the humane society.

  Christian or Cartesian dualism, the division of spirit or mind from the
  material body and world, existed long before Christianity or Descartes and
  was never limited to Western thought (though it is the “craziness” or
  “sickness” that many people under Western domination see in Western
  civilization). Lao Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist, who tries to ignore
  the body and live in the head, and the religious dualist, who despises the
  body and lives for a reward in heaven, are both dangerous and in danger. So,
  enjoy your life, he says; live in your body, you are your body; where else
  is there to go? Heaven and earth are one. As you walk the streets of your
  town you walk on the Way of heaven.

Let there be a little country without many people.
Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred,
and never use them.
Let them be mindful of death
and disinclined to long journeys.
They’d have ships and carriages,
but no place to go.
They’d have armor and weapons,
but no parades.
Instead of writing,
they might go back to using knotted cords.
They’d enjoy eating,
take pleasure in clothes,
be happy with their houses,
devoted to their customs.
