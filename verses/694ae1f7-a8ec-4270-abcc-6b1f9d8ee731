\ There were three friends
  Discussing life.
  One said：
  "Can men live together
  And know nothing of it?
  vVork together
  And produce nothing?
  Can they fly around in space
  And forget to exist
  World without end?"
  The three friends looked at each other
  And burst out laughing.
  They had no explanation.
  Thus they were better friends than before.

  Then one friend died.
  Confucius
  Sent a disciple to help the other two
  Chant his obsequies.

  The disciple found that one friend
  Had composed a song.
  While the other played a lute,
  They sang：

    "Hey, Sung Hu!
    Where'd you go?
    Hey, Sung Hu!
    Where'd you go?
    You have gone
    Where you really were.
    And we are here --
    Damn it! We are here!"

Then the disciple of Confucius burst in on them and Exclaimed： "May I
inquire where you found this in the Rubrics for obsequies, This frivolous
carolling in the presence of the departed?"

The two friends looked at each other and laughed： "Poor fellow," they
said, "he doesn't know the new liturgy!"
