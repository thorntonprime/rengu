Title: Dodging Creditors & Feeling Fog-Tied
---
You might think twice about leaving the sidelines of love where you
are allowed to dawdle.

I wouldn't enter the real playing field unless you had no other
choice. Surely you can come up with another good excuse.

You could run up some more debt. That could keep you busy dodging
creditors, like a rabbit might the fox's hunger.

Maybe get a lover on the side, maybe two, maybe three, that would
probably assure a delay in having to get serious about any inner life
for quite a spell,

before you finally decide you do in fact have to cough up some
intelligent effort at some point.

What is the value of putting your faith into practice and concluding
there really is something to all this ... God stuff?

Well, for openersï¼š It can become a solid wooden bench you can stand
on to see over a hedge that

now keeps your awareness so limited you sometimes feel hog-tied and
wish you were dead.
