Title: The Origin of the World
Description: September 10
---
Human beings seem to derive
from this planet, but essentially
we are the origin of the world.

A tiny gnat's outward form
flies about in pain and wanting,
while the gnat's inward nature
includes the entire galactic
whirling of the universe.
