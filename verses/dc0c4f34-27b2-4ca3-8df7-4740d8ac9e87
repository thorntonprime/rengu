Title: The Bitter, Lucid Joys of Solitude
---
The bitter and lucid joys of solitude. The real desert is this： to
face the real limitations of one’s own existence and knowledge and
not try to manipulate them or disguise them. Not to embellish them with
possibilities. Simply to set aside all possibilities other than those
which are actually present and real, here and now. And then to choose or
not, as one wishes, knowing that no choice is a solution to anything, but
merely a step further into a slightly changed context of other, very few,
very limited, very meaningless concrete possibilities. To realize that
one’s whole life, everybody’s life, is really like that. In society
the possibilities seem infinitely extended. One is in contact with other
people, other liberties, other choices, and who knows what the others may
suddenly all choose?

In society, in the middle of other people, one can always imagine one will
break through into other liberties and other frames of reference. Other
worlds. We have trained ourselves to think that we live at every moment
amid unlimited hopes. There is nothing we cannot have if we try hard
enough, or look in the right place for it.

But in solitude, when accurate limitations are seen and accepted, they
then vanish, and new dimensions open up. The present is in fact, in itself,
unlimited. The only way to grasp it in its unlimitedness is to remove the
limitations we place on it by future expectations and hopes and plans,
or surmises, or regrets about the past, or attempts to explain something
we have experienced (or the revived, warmed-up experience) in order to
be able to continue living with it.
