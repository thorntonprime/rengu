If thou perfectly overcome thyself, thou shalt very easily bring' all
else under the yoke.

The perfect victory is. to triumph over ourselves.

For he that keepeth himself subject, in such sort that his affections
be obedient to reason, and his reason in all things obedient to me; he
truly is conqueror of himself, and lord of the world.
