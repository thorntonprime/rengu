Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a university
professor who came to inquire about Zen.

Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor’s cup full, and then kept
on pouring.

The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain
himself. “It is overfull. No more will go in!"

“Like this cup,” Nan-in said, “you are full of your own opinions
and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?”
