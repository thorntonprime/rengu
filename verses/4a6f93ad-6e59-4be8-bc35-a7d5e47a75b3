It is a fair question whether our first parent, or parents (for they were
two in marriage), had those natural affections ere they sinned, which we
shall be free from when we are perfectly purified. If they had them, how had
they that memorable bliss of paradise? Who can be directly happy that either
fears or sorrows? And how could they either fear or grieve in that copious
affluence of bliss, where they were out of the danger of death and sickness,
having all things that a good will desired, and lacking all things that might
give their happiness just cause of offence? Their love to God was unmoved,
their union sincere, and thereupon exceeding delightful, having power to
enjoy in full what they loved. They were in a peaceable avoidance of sin,
which tranquillity kept out all external annoyance. Did they desire (do you
think?) to taste the forbidden fruit, and yet feared to die? God forbid we
should think this to be where there was no sin, for it were a sin to desire
to break Godâ€™s command, and to forbear it rather for fear of punishment
than love of righteousness.
