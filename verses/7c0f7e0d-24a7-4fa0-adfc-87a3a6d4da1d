Title: Solitude and Gentleness
---
It is in deep solitude that I find the gentleness with which I can truly
love my brothers.The more solitary I am, the more affection I have for
them. It is pure affection, and filled with reverence for the solitude
ofothers. Solitude and silence teach me to love my brothers for what they
are, not tor what they say. It is no longer a question of dishonoring them
by accepting their fictions, believing in their image of themselves, which
their weakness obliges them to compose, the wan work of cormnunication. Yet
there will, it is true, always remain a dialectic between the words of men and
their being. This will tell something about them we would not have realized
itthe words had not been there.

Solitude is not merely a negative relationship. It is not merely the absence
of people or of presence with people. True solitude is a participation in
the solitariness of God -- Who is in all things. Solitude is not a matter
of being something more than other men, except by accidentï¼š for those
who cannot be alone cannot find their true being and they are less than
themselves. Solitude means withdrawal from an artificial and fictional level
of being which men, divided by original sin, have tiibricated in order to
keep peace with concupiscence and death. But by that very fact the solitary
finds himself on the level of a more perfect spiritual society -- the city
of those who have become real enough to confess and glorify God (that is,
life) in the teeth of death. Solitude and society are formed and perfected
in the Sacrifice of the Mass.
