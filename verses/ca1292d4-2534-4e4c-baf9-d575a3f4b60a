If you know the purpose of suffering -- to burn up your ego -- youâ€™ll even
rejoice in it. Suffering is a way of purification. You heat your mind and
body to transform it, burning out the undesirable impurities. Just as gold
ore is repeatedly heated and cooled to raise its purity, all individuals
are purified by the heat of suffering. So accept suffering as it comes.
