Title: Seeding the Forest in Silence
---
When your tongue is silent, you can rest in the silence of the forest.
When your imagination is silent, the forest speaks to you. It tells
you of its unreality and of the Reality of God. But when your mind is
silent, then the forest suddenly becomes magnificently real and blazes
transparently with the Reality of God. For now I know that the
Creation, which at first seems to reveal Him in concepts, then seems
to hide Him by the same concepts, finally is revealed in Him, by the
Holy Spirit. And we who are in God find ourselves united in Him with
all that springs from Him. This is prayer, and this is glory!
