Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that
can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.

If thou obeyest most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from Allâh’s
way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess. ... And lo! a
guess can never take the place of the Truth.
