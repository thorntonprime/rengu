Silence is a great help to a seeker after truth. In the attitude of
silence the soul finds the path in a clearer light and what is elusive
and deceptive resolves itself into crystal clearness. Our life is a long
and arduous quest after Truth, and the soul requires inward restfulness
to attain its full height.
