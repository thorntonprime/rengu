The purpose of music, considered in relation to God, is to arouse longing for
Him and passionate love towards Him and to produce states in which He reveals
Himself and shows His favour, which are beyond description and are known only
by experience, and, by the §ûfîs, these states are called ‘ecstasy’. The
heart’s attainment of these states through hearing music is due to the mystic
relationship which God has ordained between the rhythm of music and the spirit
of man. The human spirit is so affected by that rhythm, that music is the cause
to it of longing and joy and sorrow and ‘expansion’ (inbisât) and ‘contraction’
(inqibâd), but he who is dull of hearing and unresponsive and hard of heart, is
debarred from this joy.
