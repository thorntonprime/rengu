It is named the water of life, the purest and most blessed water, yet not the
water of the clouds, or of any common spring, but a thick, permanent, salt, and
(in a certain sense) dry water, which wets not the hand, a slimy water which
springs out of the fatness of the earth.  Likewise, it is a double mercury and
Azoth which, being supported by the vapour or exudation of the greater and
lesser heavenly and the earthly globe, cannot be consumed by fire. For itself
is the universal and sparkling flame of the light of Nature, which has the
heavenly Spirit in itself, with which it was animated at first by God.
