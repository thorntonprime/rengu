But the proud scorner that will take no warning is of Lucifer’s
regiment, who saw the mystery of God’s kingdom to stand in meekness,
simplicity, and deep humility, and therefore out of his pride would
aspire to be above the divine love, and harmony of obedience to God’s
will, and so fell into the abyss of the dark world, into the outmost
darkness of the first principle, which we call Hell, where he and his
legions are captives; from which the Almighty God of Love deliver us.
