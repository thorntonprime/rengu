Raisedï¼š

Emperor Liang Wu requested Mahasattva Fu to expound the
Diamond Sutra. The Mahasattva then from the high seat, lifted and
brought the lectern table down once, and then came down from the seat.
Emperor Wu was dumbfounded.

The Official of the Records asked, "Does Your Highness
understand yet?"

The Emperor said, "I don't understand."

The Official of the Records said, "The Mahasattva has
finished expounding the sutra."
