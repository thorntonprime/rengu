  Title: Meister Eckhart
---
Just as there is no end to God's gifts,
there is no end to the soul's power to receive them.
As God is almighty in action,
the soul also is boundless in its capacity to take,
and thus it is transformed with God and in God.
It is necessary that God should both be active and passive
in order that He may know and love Himself in the soul,
and the soul may know as He knows and love as He loves.
It is for this reason that the soul is more blessed
by what is His than by what is its own,
and for this reason its blessing depends more on what He does
than on anything we can do.
