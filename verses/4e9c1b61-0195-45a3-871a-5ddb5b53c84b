I do not want to die without leaving a record of my belief that suffering can
be overcome. For I do believe it. What must one do? ... One must submit. Do
not resist. Take it. Be overwhelmed. Accept it fully. Make it a part of
life. Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change. So
suffering must become Love.
