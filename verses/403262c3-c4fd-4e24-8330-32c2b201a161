The revolving world is that great wheel (of delusion), and the human
heart is its nave or axis, which by its continuous rotation,
produces all this delusion within its circumference.  If, by means
of your manly exertion, you can put an end to the motion of your
heart, you will stop the rotation of the circle of delusion at once.
