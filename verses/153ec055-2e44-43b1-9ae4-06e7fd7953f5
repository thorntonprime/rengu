I am the utter poverty of God, I am His emptiness, littleness, nothingness,
lostness, When this is understood, my life in His freedom, the self-emptying
of God in me, is the fullness of grace, A love for God that knows no reason
because He is the fullness of grace, A love for God that knows no reason
because He is God; a love without measure, a love for God as personal, The
Ishvara appears as personal in order to inspire this love, Love for all,
hatred of none, is the fruit and manifestation of love for God -- peace and
satisfaction, Forgetfulness of worldly pleasure, selfishness, and so on,
in the love of God, channeling all passion and emotion into the love of God.

Technology as Karma.

What can be done has to be done, The burden of possibility that has to
be fulfilled, possibilities which demand so imperatively to be fulfilled
that everything else is sacrificed for their fulfillment, Computer Karma
in American civilization.

Distinguish work as narcotic (that is, being an operator and all that goes
with it) from healthy and free work, But also consider the wrong need for
non-action, The Astavakra Gita says： “Do not let the fruit of action
be your motive and do not be attached to non-action.” In other words,
do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, Work to
please God alone.
