Where there is mystery, there must be faith. Faith, you cannot change no
matter how you look at it. Either you have it, or you don’t. For us,
it is very simple because our feet are on the ground. We have more of the
living reality. There was a time when the Church had to show majesty and
greatness. But today, people have found that it does not pay. They have
found the emptiness of all that pomp so they are coming down more to the
ground, and in coming down there is the danger that they are not finding
their proper place.

God has created all things. All the butterflies, the animals -- the whole
of nature He has created for us. To them He has not given the will power
to choose. They have only an instinct. Animals can be very lovable and love
very beautifully, but that is out ofinstinct. But the human being can choose.
That is the one thing that God does not take from us. The will power, the
power to will. I want to go to heaven and I will, with the grace of God. IfI
choose to commit sin and go to hell, that is my choice. God cannot force
me to do otherwise. That's why when we become religious we give up that
will power. That is why the sacrifice is so great： the vow of obedience
is very difficult. Because in making that vow you surrender the only thing
that is your own -- your will power. Otherwise my health, my body, my eyes,
my everything are all His and He can take them. I can fall, I can break,
but my will power doesn’t go like this. I must choose to give it and that
is beautiful.
