Death as finality or extinction is only a concept of thought, and has no
reality. Our spiritual essence will continue to flow with the whole and
ever change and evolve. Thus, through the death of form we evolve and find
renewal. Inform our energy radiates outward, and we relate to this energy
vibrating around us; but in death of form, our energy radiates inward as we
go back into the center of our essence.
