A philosopher apostrophised the soul： ‘Withdraw from the restlessness of
external activities!’ And again： ‘Flee away and hide thee from the turmoil of
outward occupations and inward thoughts for they create nothing but discord!’
If God is to speak his Word in the soul she must be at rest and at peace.
