It was a fine night on deck, clear, with bright stars and a faint, quivering
circle of the northern lights. The night was cool, without a breath of wind.
The ship, with her own small lights, was like an insignificant fragment
of a distant world anchored there in space. The mate took out his pipe and
tinderbox. There was a flash of spark as he expertly hit the flint against
the steel, and then the tinder glowed.

“Johnny March,” he said, “I’ve kind of got to like you. Now you listen
to what I say. This kind of spark’s all right, but not the kind you were
striking in the cabin. You leave the old man be. He’s as good a master
as there is, and he’s honest with the owners and that’s all we have to
care for. I’ve sailed with Griggs before. I don’t need to tell you that
a master’s king aboard his ship, and you know it makes ’em queer. I’ve
never seen a skipper yet who liked to be crossed. You better leave him be.”

“Yes sir,” said John March.

“And listen, Johnny,” the mate said, “the islands are a fine
place. You’ll like the islands. The islands are like heaven, pretty near. The
captain will take you ashore, of course, to make the bargain. You’ll see
plenty of funny sights, but keep your mouth shut, Johnny, except to say
’Yessir’, to the captain. We’ve got a long way yet to go.”

“Yes sir,” said John March.

“That’s right,” said Sprague, “that’s right. I like a tight-lipped
boy.”
