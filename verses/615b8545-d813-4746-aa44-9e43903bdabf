The soul is born in this world upon leaving the soul of the world
(anima mundi) in which her existence precedes the one we all know.
Thus, the Gods who consider her proceedings in all the phases of
various existences and as a whole, punish her sometimes for sins
Judgment committed during an anterior life.
