Deshan arrived at Guishan carrying under his arm his
vestment bundle and went up into the Dharma Hall. From the east he
crossed to the west. From the west he crossed to the east. He turned
his head to look around and observe and said "Without, without."
(alt."Nothing, nothing" or "Not, not.") Then he exited.

Xuedou's attached words say, "Investigate and expose
completely!"

Deshan got to the main gate and turned back saying, "I
should not get careless either."

Then he prepared for a dignified ceremony and again entered
to meet together. Guishan sat. Next Deshan lifted and unfolded his
sitting paraphenalia (i.e., a sitting cloth or very thin mat) and said,
"Venerable."

Guishan intended to take up the whisk. Deshan then shouted
and shook (pun with whisk) his sleeves and then exited.

Xuedou's attached words say, "Investigate and expose
completely!"

Deshan turned his back on the Dharma hall, put on his straw
sandals, and then went on foot. When evening arrived, Guishan asked
the Head-Seat monk, "The coming and going newcomer, where is he?"

The Head-Seat said, "At that time he turned his back and
withdrew from the Dharma hall; wearing his straw sandals he exited and
went away besides!"

Guishan said, "In that case, then, the son will afterwards
be guided to ascend to the top of a solitary peak to tie and weave a
grass hut where he will have leave to laugh at the Buddhas and revile
the ancestors."

Xuedou's attached words say, "Frost is added on top of the
snow."
