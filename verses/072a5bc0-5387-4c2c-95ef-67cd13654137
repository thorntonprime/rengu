Title: Probes the Depths from Which Your Life Springs
---
My only advice for you is this. Go within yourself and probe the depths
from which your life springs, and there at its source you'll find the answer
to the question of whether you must write. Accept this answer, just as you
hear it, without hesitation. It may be revealed that you are called to be
an artist. Then take this lot upon you, and bear it, its burden and its
greatness, without asking for any external reward. For the creative artist
must be a world for himself, and find everything within himself -- and in
nature, to which he is devoted.
