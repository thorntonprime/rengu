  - Discernment-Truth=The Eye Of Eternity-Supreme Center=Omniscience and Omnipresence
By: Eckhart
Commentary: It is only this once-begotten Person who can be omniprogenitive,
  hence omnipresent, and thus necessarily omniscient and so capable of
  ’remembering’ his former births (cf. Coomaraswamy：‘Recollection. Indian
  and Platonic', p. II)

The soul that lives ir, the present Now-moment is the soul in which the
Father begets his only-begotten Son and in that birth the soul is born
again. It is still one birth, however often the soul is reborn in God,
as the Father begets his only-begotten Son.
