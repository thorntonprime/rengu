Love, once called love, already isn’t love.
Where is the word that can name it?
Can it be touched by rosy lips smiling faintly in anguish?
Can it be lighted by autumn eyes reflecting dark sorrow behind its tears?
Does it exist beyond shadowless clouds, echoless precipices,
 and the sea that the mind can’t reach?
That land has no boundaries. A lifespan has no time.
The presence of love cannot be known through eyes or mind.
Love’s secret is known only through your embroidery needle,
your planted flowers, in your sleep, and in the poet’s imagination.
