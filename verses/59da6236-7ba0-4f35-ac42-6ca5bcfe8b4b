  Islamic tradition teaches that Muhammad is the last in the line of prophets
  to come in this cycle; he is therefore often referred to as ‘Seal of the
  Prophets’ (khâtimu ‘n-nabiyin).

Some traditionalists assert that his lordship the last of prophets (Muhammad)
was sleeping in the cave of Mount Hira, when Jebrâil (Gabriel) made his
appearance in the shape of a man, and said： ‘Read.’ But his lordship
answered： ‘I am not a reader.’ Then Jebrâil squeezed him so hard that
he thought his death was near; but the angel again said, ‘Read,’ received
the same answer, and again pressed his holy and prophetic lordship. After
having repeated this proceeding thrice, Jebrâil exclaimed： ‘Read：
In the name of thy Lord Who createth, createth man from a clot. Read： And
thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, Who teacheth by the pen, teacheth man that
which he knew not.’ One of the U’iâma says： ‘The first squeezing
purified his august nature from all concupiscence, the second from all
sinful desires, although the heart receives all good and evil impressions,
such as the radiations of the faith and the inspirations of Satan. It is true
that the blessed heart of his holy and prophetic lordship was free from all
ignominious qualities, but his purification was necessary to divest it from
human failings and to prepare it for the reception of Divine revelations.’
