Suicide may be regarded as an experiment -- a question which man puts to
Nature, trying to force her to an answer. The question is this： What change
will death produce in a man’s existence and in his insight into the nature
of things? It is a clumsy experiment to make; for it involves the
destruction of the very consciousness which puts the question and awaits
the answer.
