Title: Waiting
---
You have me waiting day after day.
When the setting sun casts mountain shadows over the village,
I go beyond the grove to wait in desperate hope.
The children drive the oxen home, their reed flutes stifled with music.
The birds return to distant trees, swimming in the evening smoke.
The woods stand quietly, having sported with the wind.
This is a sign of its sympathy for me.
When the gravel path lies in darkness, following the stream
  I retrace my idle steps, leaving fading sighs in the quiet, distant sky.

You have me waiting day after day.
When darkness consumes the thin light of dusk,
I stand vacantly at the gate to wait.
The returning stars sparkle with a joyful look
  and nod their heads in greeting.
The insects in the grass make a peaceful night with their strange songs,
and lay to rest the battles of the day.
Mocked by the deceitful wind that rustles the lotus leaves in the pond,
my distant thoughts change into sharp resentment.

You have me waiting day after day.
When the relentless pace of time drives all hope away,
I lie in my desolate bed and wait.
The pressure point in my heart has caused storms in lifeâ€™s sea,
and the three thousand worlds have been washed away.
The pitiable butterfly, friendless and fading,
has suffocated in the forest of desire.
Noble philosophy has succumbed to the samadhi of tears.
My waiting has failed to find me, and in the end forgets itself.
