I asked God for strength that I might achieve. I was made weak that I
might learn humbly to obey. I asked for health that I might do greater
things. I was given infirmity that I might do better things. I asked for
riches that I might be happy. I was given poverty that I might be wise. I
asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was given weakness
that I might feel the need of God. I asked for all things that I might
enjoy life. I was given life that I might enjoy all things. I got nothing
that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost despite myself,
my unspoken prayers were answered. I am, among all men, most richly blessed.
