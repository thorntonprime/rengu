Commentary: |
  \‘Of that Reality our mind has no conception. Whatever can be affirmed or
  denied falls short of it, as Dionysius says (Theologia Mystica C. 5). Yet
  in every knowing it is at once and undividedly the implicit knower and the
  implicitly known. When the mind has learned to say nothing Intellect shines of
  itself’ (Bernard Kelley： 'The Metaphysical Background of Analogy'. Aquinas
  Society of London, no. 29. Blackfriars Publications. 1958. p. 23).

The One Self, the Sole Reality, alone exists eternally. When even the Ancient
Teacher. Dakshinamurthi, revealed It through speechless Eloquence, who else
could have conveyed it by speech?
