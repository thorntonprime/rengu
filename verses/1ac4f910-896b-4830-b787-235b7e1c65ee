Eliminate the ‘sage’： forget ‘wisdom’
People will be a hundred times better off.
Eliminate ‘benevolence’： forget ‘rectitude’,
And people will have filial piety.
Eliminate cleverness： forget profit,
And there’ll be less thieves and rogues.
Superficial things are insufficient,
What is needed is all-embracing.
Exhibit the unadorned.
Hold fast to the un-carved block.
Avoid the thought of Self.
Eliminate desire.
