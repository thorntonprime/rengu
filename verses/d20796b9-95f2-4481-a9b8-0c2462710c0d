Title: Lose Yourself!
---
Make a start with yourself
by abandoning yourself.

For if you do not begin
by taking leave of who

you are, everything
you do or think you are

and all you seek will be
an obstacle for you, and

    you will be like one
    who has lost her way

and in wandering only
becomes further lost,

    so if you wish to find
    your way, lose Yourself!
