Whatever thoughts, or concepts, or obscuring (or disturbing) passions
arise are neither to be abandoned nor allowed to control oneï¼š they
are to be allowed to arise without one's trying to direct (or shape)
them. If one do no more than merely to recognize them as soon as they
arise, and persist in so doing, they will come to be realized (or to
dawn) in their true (or void) form through not being abandoned.
