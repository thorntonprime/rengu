Lo! thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf
to hear the call when they have turned to flee;

Nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none
to hear, save those who believe Our revelations and who have
surrendered.

And when the word is fulfilled concerning them. We shall bring forth a
beast of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in
Our revelations.
