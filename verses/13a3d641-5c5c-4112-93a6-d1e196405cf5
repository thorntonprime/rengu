Now, do not say, ‘There is no time or leisure to go to meditation, there
is too much business and it is almost impossible to carry on one’s plans
for meditation when the duties of this world are so pressing.’ It should be
known that for a robed monk who performs the discipline of meditation in the
right spirit there is no such thing as business or worldly affairs. ... My
own old teacher, Sho-ju, always used to say, 'Anyone who desires to learn
how to meditate uninterruptedly, even if he has to enter a city of murders
and swords, or to go into a room of weeping and wailing, or to attend the
wrestling ring or the theatre hall or music hall, need not add adjustment of
thought to adjustment of thought, nor does he have to make careful calculations
about it-all he has to do is to bundle every one of these things into one
meditation topic, and then go forward without a break and without withdrawing
or retreating.’
