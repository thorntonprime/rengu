Thus those who desire the fruit of Buddhahood should renounce the notion of
existence because it is deluding like a magical display, but they should also
renounce the notion of non-existence, for it is non-existent. O Wise Ones,
do ye now hearken, for in so far as one renounces both extremes, the state
in which one abides is neither Samsara nor Nirvana, for one has renounced
these two.
