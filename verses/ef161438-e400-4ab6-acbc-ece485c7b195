What is this thing called the Way? There is the Way of Heaven, and the
way of man. To rest in inaction, and command respect - this is the Way
of Heaven. To engage in action and become entangled in it - this is the
way of man. The ruler is the Way of Heaven; his subjects are the way of
man. The Way of Heaven and the way of man are far apart. This is
something to consider carefully!
