In this fountain (of life) shines a wonderful carbuncle. ... It lights up
these regions more magnificently than any worldly sun could do. It puts the
night to exile and makes the day eternal, without end and without beginning;
it is a sun which stays in the same place without passing through the signs
of the year, or through the hours which measure the day ï¼š it is a sun which
has neither noon nor midnight. The carbuncle possesses such a marvelous power
that those who approach it and look at their faces in the water see all the
things in the park, whichever way they turn, and know them truly, and also
themselves. And once they have seen themselves therein, they will never be the
victims of any illusion, so clear-sighted and wise do they return from there.
