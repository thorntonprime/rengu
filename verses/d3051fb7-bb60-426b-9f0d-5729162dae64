Title: When Thigns Close In
Description: May 28
Format: Verse
---
It feels as though I make my own way
through massive rock
like a vein of ore
alone, encased.

I am so deep inside it
I can't see the path or any distanceï¼š
everything is close
and everything closing in on me
has turned to stone.

Since I still don't know enough about pain,
this terrible darkness makes me small,
If it's you, though --

press down hard on me, break in
that I may know the weight of your hand
and you, the fullness of my cry.
