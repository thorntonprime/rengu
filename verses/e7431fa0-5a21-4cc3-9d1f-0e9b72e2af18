  Delivers beings from every woe.
  -- Lotus Sutra

The embassy of the boat-women t0 Kuan Yin’s temple well exemplifies
how peasants in China and neighbouring countries conceive of her. Seeing
her as a benevolent goddess into whose nature it would be discourteous
to enquire, they rejoice because she is lovely in herself and generous
in heeding supplications. This uncomplicated attitude is not limited to
illiterate followers of ancient folk-religions, for even among the general
run of Buddhists in China and Japan, the distinction between deities
and celestial Bodhisattvas is blurred. However, more erudite Buddhists
see her otherwise. The following account ofan experience significant to
me personally prefaces two other stories that will serve as a preview of
some of the ways in which Kuan Yin is conceptualised. One, though it does
just touch upon the Mind Only doctrine lying at the root of the celestial
Bodhisattva concept, reveals her in a guise very similar to that ofa goddess,
whereas the other carries us to a high metaphysical level.

One of the three main annual festivals of Kuan Yin, Hearer-of-Cries,
falls on the nineteenth day ofthe sixth lunar month (about July). For
centuries it has been celebrated by gatherings in her honour, some of
which assemble on the twelfth of the month and spend no less than seven
days on rites and contemplative meditation centred on Kuan Yin. Alas,
in recent years the ranks of her followers have been thinned. For all
I know, such festivals still take place in Japan, Korea and Singapore,
but hardly in China or Viet-Nam.

Quite soon after my arrival in China, while staying at a monastery nestling
among clumps of lychee-trees 0n the sunny side of a minor sacred mountain,
I heard that “Kuan Yin’s Birthday" was going to be celebrated that
evening at a neighbouring temple over which she presided, so at sunset I
set off in that direction. By the time I arrived, night had fallen. Scudding
clouds obscured the moon, but peach-shaped lanterns suspended from the
temple gateway’s elegantly curving roof cast a pool of crimson light
that could be seen from a distance. Beyond lay a courtyard thronged with
worshippers whose faces were illumined by the rays of perhaps a hundred
candles streaming through the shrine-hall’s wide-flung doors. Most
were lay-people, but a sprinkling of bald pates showed that some monks
and nuns from neighbouring monasteries were among them. All were craning
their heads towards the shrine where Kuan Yin’s statue rose behind a
lavishly carved and gilded altar where stood innumerable candle-sticks,
a great bronze incense tripod and an array of porcelain vessels piled with
offerings of fruit and flowers. No animal flesh or cups of wine were to
be seen, for even the peasants had some inkling of the difference between
Kuan Yin and the more gluttonous local deities; besides, the keepers of
the shrine would have rejected such offerings as impure and displeasing
to the Bodhisattva -- though not monks, they would hardly have accepted
them even for themselves.

The night air, drenched with the mingled perfumes of burning sandalwood
and of jasmine and champak flowers, quivered as the mallet thudded upon a
large hollowed block known as the wooden-fish drum; its throb was punctuated
by the clang and tinkle of bronze and silver instruments used to mark the
rhythm of the chant. Though the same few words, Namu tatzu‘ tapez' Kuan
Shz'h Yin P’u-Sa (Homage to the greatly compassionate, greatly merciful
Kuan Shih Yin Bodhisattva)! were intoned repeatedly, the ardour of those
taking part and frequent subtle changes in the rhythm dispelled monotony,
so that the music lifted me into a realm of beauty and enchantment.

Taller than the wiry southerners pressing all about me, I had an
unobstructed view. The Bodhisattva was depicted as a gracious young lady
with smoothly rounded cheeks and chin, sitting very informally upon a
rock-like throne, one knee raised so high that the elegant little slipper
peeping from beneath her robe was on a level with the other knee. One
slender hand toyed with a willow sprig, the other held a vase of “sweet
dew” symbolising the nectar of compassion. To either side, wrought on
a smaller scale, stood her attendants -- Shan Ts’ai, a smiling boy,
and Lung Nu, the Dragon Maiden, who was holding out a giant pearl. These
statues can hardly have been the work of local artists; they were finely
sculpted and had a pleasing liveliness, though I could have wished them
less ornate. But for her distinctive posture and the nature of the symbols
in her hands, the splendidly robed and bejewelled figure could almost have
been mistaken for that of Mary arrayed as Queen of Heaven in the manner of
South Europe. Superficially at least, her robes and ornaments resembled
artifacts from Byzantium. Struck by this lavish costume, I wondered how
this empress-like being could be made to hit in with the gently austere
teaching of the Buddha; for I had still to learn that the external forms
taken by Buddhism in different countries, though strikingly varied,
entail no real departures from its doctrines.

Presently a gust of wind sent incense-smoke billowing upwards in heavy
clouds that momentarily blurred the Bodhisattva’s features, creating
the illusion of a living being whose expression now altered and took on
unimaginable beauty. As though chiding my churlishness in the matter of
her costume, she seemed to fix me with her eyes and gently shake her head.

Aware that this was no miracle, I was nevertheless entranced and tried
hard to believe that the goddess had taken notice of me. What is more,
there seemed to hover just beyond the threshold of my mind a teasing
recollection of something or someone once greatly loved but long faded
from my memory. The effect was so poignant that I wanted both to laugh
and to cry. I am convinced that it was this elusive recollection rather
than the trick wrought by the incense smoke that produced what seems in
retrospect a magical effect; in that moment I conceived a reverence for
the Compassionate One which, far from fading with the years, was destined
to intensify, although for a long time it remained no more than a pleasant
whimsy. In those days I had not the wisdom to reconcile deep devotion to
a deity with the knowledge that deities are not!

I was too moved to pay attention to what followed. No doubt the long period
of invocation gave place to recitation of the P’u Me‘n chapter of the
Lotus Su‘tra or of Kuan Yin‘s Dha‘rani‘ of Great Compassion. The
rite must have ended with an inspiring crescendo of cymbals and drums
succeeded by an eerie silence as the Officiants prostrated themselves;
but by then I had slipped away to begin my walk through the darkness to
the monastery where I lodged. To this day I recall my pleasure in the cool
night air so free from cloying scents, the creek of bamboos swaying in the
wind and the scurrying of small creatures in the undergrowth. Throughout
the walk I indulged the poetic fancy that the goddess had wished to
remind me of something immensely important to my happiness. Such a mood
is not difficult to sustain while strolling by moonlight on the slopes
of a mountain where immortal beings have been worshipped since before the
dawn of history; the very atmosphere is vibrant with intimations of their
presence. To a part of my mind which told me I was being absurd, I put
up strenuous resistance, being loath to return to an ugly world which,
even in those days, was fast coming under the domination of monsters
disguised as inventors and technicians. Having disposed ofcavilling logic,
my mind soared, leading me to a state borc dering on ecstasy. I had a
foretaste of the wisdom born of full realisation that only mind is real;
the demons ofduality were temporarily vanquished so that it became possible
to entertain simultaneously two opposing facets of truth,

Back at the monastery, while waiting for the sleepy porter to admit me, I
became aware ofa delicious fragrance which I supposed to have a supernatural
origin until, looking up, I saw that the gateway was overhung by the
boughs of a tree called in Chinese yell-lai-hsz'ang (night fragrance)
which pours out its perfume during the first watches of the night. The
great courtyard was in darkness, the monks being still away celebrating
the festival or else retired to their cells to sleep or meditate until
summoned for the morning rite an hour before dawn. Noticing that lamps
still glimmered in the deserted shrine-hall, I felt a sudden impulse to
enter and make my way round behind the Buddha statues to where it was
customary in Chinese monasteries to house a statue of Kuan Yin. There
she was, standing upon a shelf at about the level ofmy chest. It was an
image of fine bronze some three feet high, with the right hand raised in
benediction, the elongated eyes half closed in contemplative bliss. The
stumps of votive candles still guttered at her feet, whereas the incense
sticks lit in her honour had burnt down to the stubs leaving behind a sour
staleness. It seems sad that deities have to endure this odour when their
worshippers have retired for the night. Perhaps the truth is that it is the
worshippers themselves who enjoy temple offerings. Lighting fresh incense,
I stood before her in silence until, suddenly carried away by exaltation,
I whispered, “Compassionate One, be pleased to speak and convince me
of your reality!”

How foolish this must sound and how ashamed I should be to write of it,
were it not for the sequel. Even with the words upon my lips I reflected
that a sane man should know better than to attempt holding converse with
a statue! Yet perhaps I had some excuse; for, apart from being then in
a special state of mind, I had recently spent much time in the company
of certain Chinese Buddhists who, despite being men ofobvious good sense
and erudition, would have found nothing surprising in such conduct. As
it turned out, no justification was needed, for the plain truth is that
the statue answered me at once, saying： “Look not for my reality in
the realm of appearances or in the Void. Seek it in your own mind. There
only it resides.”

I wish I could make the story even more extraordinary by affirming
that the bronze lips moved, that the beautifully moulded throat gave
forth melodious sounds. It was not so. No sound or movement stirred the
silence. The enigmatic words entered my consciousness as thought-forms,
but so palpably that not even sound itself could have made the effect more
electrifying or their sequence more precise. It is hard to believe that,
at a time when my knowledge of Mahayana Buddhism was so slight, I could
have summoned such a pronouncement from within myself. I did not really
know then what the first sentence meant. I felt sure I had received an
intimation that Kuan Yin exists-to the extent that “exists” is a
fitting description ofher subtle nature. Using the word thus is perhaps
to overstate the case, just as to say that she does not exist would be to
understate it. My experience was not imaginary. Such intuitive perceptions
are too direct, too penetrating to be mistaken for ordinary imaginings. Yet
for years I hesitated to speak of it, except to my Chinese friends,
who understood its nature; but now I have come to recognise that no good
purpose is served by concealing marvels merely because people nowadays are
apt to disbelieve them. In truth, such a marvel is not magical to those who
recognise mind’s sovereign power over phenomena of every kind whatsoever.

  Chrysanthemumx are gold
  To those who see them so.
  Red gold is just a metal
  Till thought-forms give it worth.

There is a modern short story about a timid knight who, armed with a
magic word to make him invulnerable, slew fifty dragons as easily as
cockroaches. Unfortunately, while engaged in slaying the fiftieth, he
suddenly realised that he had been tricked by his teacher into putting
faith in a madeup nonsense-word. Needless to say, his fifty-first dragon
gobbled him up in no time at all! Yet can one say that the magic wrought
by his faith in that nonsense-word was not real? It stood him in far better
stead than his “real” armour and “objectively existing” sword!

A British-educated Chinese friend of mine once told me a story that fully
bears out this view of reality.

“As you know, though my mother was a Buddhist, I received all my
pre-university education at Catholic schools, was baptised at sixteen and
later took a Catholic wife. For years I was as devout a convert as could
reasonably be expected of a man like me, a geologist. Then came the war
which sent so many of us fleeing westward before the Japanese advance. My
native city suffered cruelly from indiscriminate rape and slaughter. I
could not think ofmy old home without tears. My work for a government
prospecting enterprise took me to some wild and lonely places in Kweichow
province and once I was sent to look for wolfram in a mountainous region
six or seven days walk from the nearest motor-road. One day, an hour
before our usual stop for midday rice, I mistook a mule-track for the path
we were following and wandered far away from the men carrying my luggage
and equipment. Knowing I was lost, but hungry and convinced by occasional
fresh piles of mule dung that the track must lead to human habitations,
I pressed forward. Upward and upward I went until clouds were swirling
about me and I could hear what sounded like the weird cries of gibbons
high up in the trees. At every turn I hoped in vain to come upon at least
a woodsman’s hovel, butl had wandered too far by then to feel it wise
to turn back. I needed food and some local man to guide me to where my
porters were likely to be found.

“An icy wind came tearing down from the high peaks and dusk was closing
in. Eerie sounds were all about me, some recognisable as the voices of
wind and stream, others inexplicable and mournful as the cries of wandering
ghosts. With each step I grew more afraid and the mists swirling among the
rocks grew denser and more opaque. Fears of wild beasts rose to haunt me;
as for bandits, of whom the local people had told me sinister tales,I longed
to meet a fellow-human being, bandit or not. At last terror brought me to
my knees beside the path and, teeth chattering, I poured out a prayer to
my patron saint, St. Bernadette, begging that sweet child (as I thought of
her) to appear and lead me to a place of safety. By what light remained,
my eyes sought for her among the rocks. I believed that if she did not
come,l should lose my sanity, if not my life!

“Then she was there, standing on a small flat rock, her flimsy blue robe
hardly ruffled by the fierce and bitterly cold wind. She was smiling, asI
could see well, for around her glowed a nimbus of soft light. Gradually
I took in that there was something unexpected about her face. Then I
realised what it was -- she was a Chinese Bernadette! Her high-swept
hair, the jewelled ornaments clasped about her throat, the white silk
trousers peeping through a blue robe slit to the thigh were those of a
noble Chinese maiden many centuries ago.

“‘Come, Elder Brother,’ she said, speaking melodious Mandarin in a
childish voice too young to have belonged to Bernadette even at the time
of her first meeting with the Holy Virgin, ‘I shall show you a place
where you can rest safely and tomorrow all will be very well.’

“She led me a short distance to a shallow cave well protected from
the wind. Its floor was as soft as the softest of beds and I am nearly
sure I caught sight ofa silken pez'-wo (quilt) stuffed no doubt with
warm silk-floss, just as I fell asleep in the very act of lying down at
her command.

“The next day I awoke, after a long, deep sleep, to find the sun high
in the sky. There was no sign of bedding and the floor of the cave, far
from being soft, was rugged and strewn with pebbles, but I had slept as
well and warmly as in the room I once shared with my mother in my beloved
native place, now a thousand 12' away. While I was washing in a nearby
stream, a train of mules came down the track, driven by three mounted
lo-fu. I easily persuaded one of these mule-drivers to sell me some cold
steamed bread -- he would have given it without payment, I am sure --
and, with his help, I was able to rejoin my party by noon the following day.

“For more than a year I believed I had been saved by St. Bernadette,
though I could not account for her extreme youthfulness and Chinese
appearance. Then, one day, I happened to take shelter from the rain in
a disused temple not far from Chengtu and there, in a small chapel,
I came upon a faded fresco showing Kuan Yin clad in a simple robe of
blue cotton without her usual ornaments. Seated by the ocean, she was
attended as usual by Shan Ts’ai and Lung Nu". In great astonishment, I
recognised in Lung Nu" my ‘Bernadette’l Even the blue dress and white
trousers were the same, but now there were no jewels clasped about her
throat. Thinking about those jewels roused a memory ofa similar picture
that used to hang in my mother's bedroom, showing both Kuan Yin and Lung
Nu” adorned with splendid ornaments. So that was it! You could say that
the lady who saved my life on that freezing night was neither Bernadette
nor Lung Nu", just a childhood memory lighting up a fear-crazed mind. And
you would be right-partly! Still, childish memories do not guide people
to unknown caves, make rocks and pebbles become fine mattresses, conjure
pad-was from the air or drive away deadly cold.

“Yes, in a way you would be right. It was that memory. It was also Lung
Nu" herself, sent out of pity by Kuan Yin. Having since then studied
the profound Mahayana doctrine of Mind Only, I accept no contradiction
between those two. Driven to the edge ofa reason, I sought divine aid,
and divine aid came instantly -- in a form that accorded with the contents
of my mind. It was as a mental apparition that Lung Nu" appeared and
brought from my mind the warmth and comfort that made me physically
able to withstand great cold. Would you dare say that was not a miracle
wrought by the Bodhisattva I had worshipped as a child? All miracles
are so -- working through mind. True, the Bodhisattva did not come
herself. Having too much delicacy to appear before someone calling on a
foreign goddess, she sent Lung Nu" who could be taken for the child saint
I was expecting. Attributing my good fortune to the marvellous workings
of my own mind and accepting it as the intervention of the Bodhisattva
are two ways ofexpressing the same truth."

I have often pondered on the mineralogist’s wisdom-opening experience. His
penetrating understanding ofit explains many similar occurrences, bridging
the gap between magical and psychological. Years later, I chanced to
hear -- at second hand -- another story, different in purport, but also
illustrating the identity of miraculous intervention from “within”
and “without” the mind. To understand what the narrator tells us,
one must know that, whereas Kuan Yin, though often depicted as a member
ofa trinity with the celestial Buddha Amitahha in the centre and Kuan Yin
and Ta Shih-Chih Bodhisattvas standing on either hand, is also worshipped
independently by millions, this is not the case with Ta Shih-Chih. The
latter seems to have faded from human consciousness, being rarely invoked
in his own right. I am told the narrator was a very old gentleman called
Mr. Ch’e‘n, who had spent the last forty years of his life as a recluse.

“In my young days, preparing for the imperial civil service examinations
was, for cultivated youths, the most important thing in life. Everything
depended on success -- not just rank and wealth, but the honour brought
to one’s family and the power to serve society effectively. You cannot
imagine how hard we used to work at the ancient classics, straining our
eyes through reading late into the night by the pitiful glimmer of a wick
floating in a saucer of oil. No wonder so many of us became stooped early
in life with all that poring over books! For me and my four brothers it
was especially bad. My father, who loved the Buddhist sutras even more than
the Confucian classics, made us spend much time on those as well! I do not
know whether we grudged the extra burden more or less than we came to love
the splendour, vastness and depth of their philosophy. ‘You must,’ my
father often said, ‘pursue these studies until the meaning of the four
characters FEI K'UNG CHIH K’UNG (voidness of the non-void) is as clear
to you as the orb of the sun blazing down from a cloudless autumn sky.’

“On some nights when I was especially weary, I liked to imagine that
the compassionate Kuan Yin appeared before me in the library in a blaze
of light. This never failed to wipe away my fatigue, making me as alert
as in the mornings. Afterwards I could read the sutras quickly, easily
and with greater understanding. I do not say that I truly saw her, unless
dimly with my mind’s eye, but I knew when and how sweetly she smiled or
when she was displeased with a feeling I sometimes had that reading so
many sutras was an intolerable chore. My fourth brother, who was sickly
and the only one of us to fail the examinations, was extremely fond of
me. When we were alone, we put aside the formality that had to be shown in
public by juniors to seniors, even brothers almost of an age. Once when
I had been describing what I liked to call the Bodhisattva’s personal
manifestations to me, he said, laughing： ‘I-Iow you flatter yourself,
Second Brother. Such things don’t happen. If they do, why is it always
Kuan Yin and never Ta Shih-Chih who appears? The picture in our shrine-room
contains both of them; they get the same amount ofincense, bowing and
the rest. Why doesn’t Ta Shih-Chih do his share of healing you? It
is because you forget him that he plays no part in your imagination --
for it is imagination, whatever you say.’

“His words set me thinking. I did not agree with his main point, but
he had made me feel guilty towards Ta Shih-Chih Bodhisattva, to whom none
of us paid reverence except as one of three. I began offering him special
prayers. For several months I never went to sleep at night without first
sitting cross-legged on my bed and visualising Ta Shih-Chih. But when I
invoked him instead of Kuan Yin, there was no result. Never any result at
all. At last I spoke of this to my father. Unable to explain, he sent me
off to a monastery lying a few li beyond the city wall and overlooking a
stream bordered with ancient willows -- Kuan Yin’s emblem. On learning
why I had come, the elderly Tripitaka Master who presided there smiled
and said： ‘You alone cannot evoke him.’

“‘You mean, Venerable, that the Bodhisattvas are merely forms in
people’s minds.” I protested, full of wonder to hear a monk speak
so. Seeing him vigorously shake his head, I went on： ‘If they are real,
what need of many minds to give them power to appear?’

“‘What an ignorant young scholar you must be!’ he answered,
laughing. ‘Surely you know there are not many minds -- just Mind. All
the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, all the myriad objects exist in this one
Mind. How could it be otherwise? What is in your mind is naturally in
Mind itself; even so, until you have dissipated the great mountains of
obscurations constructed by karma earned in previous lives, you will not
have the power to call forth a response to the feeble thoughts you put
there. With Kuan Yin, the case is otherwise because so many millions of
beings invoke her. Now do you understand.”

“‘Venerable Sir, this worthless disciple can catch something of the
profound purport of your enlightening teaching,’ I answered formally,
though by no means sure I did. Satisfied, he raised his tea-cup in
dismissal.

“That night I sat up later than any of my brothers. The little libraryboy,
who had orders from my father to stay within call until the last of us
had handed him the books that needed putting away, replenished my tea-pot
three times before I remembered to tell him to go off to bed, promising
to put the flimsy volumes very carefully away in their blue boxes with my
own hands. No sooner had the child walked off sleepily than the far end of
the dimly lit library was illumined by a softly brilliant radiance and,
as I fell to my knees, a slim, majestically tall, richly garbed figure,
whom I took to be Kuan Yin was manifested in the centre of that circle of
very bright but not dazzling light. The garments of the two Bodhisattvas
being similar except for the head-dress, it took me a few moments to
recognise Ta Shih-Chih encircled by a nimbus of golden flame.

“‘Old Two,’ he announced in a thrillingly beautiful voice, but
addressing me informally by the nickname used by my father and uncles,
‘the Venerable Tripitaka Master erred. Know that your mind is in itself
immeasurable, the container ofa myriad myriad universes, each ofthem vast
beyond your comprehension. All the illimitable power that exists in those
myriads of universes would be yours in full, if you had wisdom enough
to use it. The same is true of every sentient being. Because your faith
in me was not Well developed, I have come to you always as Kuan Yin --
not as I am now. Can you suppose we are two? Two in the great Mind where
no two exist? Can a Bodhisattva feel wounded by neglect for as long
as any other Bodhisattva is called upon? Not to speak of Bodhisattvas,
when a single bee sucks honey, all beings in the myriad myriad universes
suck honey; when a worm is crushed, all beings in those universes are
crushed. Remember the source of all power lies within yourself and cease
this foolish longing to behold mere manifestations.’

“The lovely vision faded and was gone. Since then, I have never
dared to call upon such beings, except as it should be done during
meditation. Seeking from them power beyond the infinite power of our
own mind, which is limited only by our own dark karmic obstructions, is
like what the sutras call ‘looking for a head upon your head! When,
at those previous times, Kuan Yin assuaged my fatigue, it was because
my mind willed that fatigue away, but needed the stimulation of the
Bodhisattva’s presence to function thus.

“Believe me, the Bodhisattvas are as real as earth and sky and have
infinite power to aid beings in distress, but they exist within our
common mind, which, to speak the truth, is itself the container of earth
and sky.”

Both the mineralogist's story and old Mr. Ch’én’s illustrate a concept
not easy to grasp and perhaps not fully graspable until Enlightenment is
won; but they do make it clear that, when Kuan Yin is regarded by some as
a mental creation and by others as a being hardly distinguishable from
a goddess, there is no question of the one view being right, the other
wrong. She is both an abstraction and a goddess; how one sees her depends
upon one's expectation and attitude ofmind. All such mental attitudes,
though one may think ofthem as “higher” or “lower” in the sense
of exhibiting more or less wisdom and understanding, are probably so
far from the ultimate truth that differences in one’s level of wisdom
becomes negligible. Nor is it certain that to perceive a Bodhisattva as
a god -- or goddess-like being does in fact demonstrate a lower degree
of wisdom. All talk of high and low, except in relative and provisional
contexts, is beside the point.
