Nothing can be rushed. Things must grow, they must grow upward, and if the
time should ever come for the great work -- then so much the better.

We must go on searching.

We have found parts, but not the whole!

We still lack the ultimate strength for： there is no people to sustain us.

But we are looking for a people. We began over there in the Bauhaus. We
began with a community to which each one of us gave what we had.

More we cannot do.
