Title: Her Presence Demands My Love
---
A cold night.Woke up to find the night filled with the depth and silence
of snow. Stayed up here in the hermitage for supper last night, but having
cooked soup and cut up a pear and a banana for dessert, and made toast,
finally came to the conclusion that it was all too elaborate. If there were
no better reason for fasting, the mere fact of saving time would be a good
enough reason. For the bowl and the saucepan have to be washed, and I have
only a bucket of rainwater for washing, etc., etc. Taking only coffee for
breakfast makes a lot of sense, because I can read quietly and sip my two
mugs of coffee at leisure, and it really suffices for the morning.

There is a great need for discipline in meditation. Reading helps.The
early morning hours are good, though in the morning meditation (one hour)
I am easily distracted by the f1re.An hour is not much, but I can be more
meditative in the hour of reading that follows (and which goes much too
first).The presence of Our Lady is important to me. Elusive but I think a
reality in this hermitage. Her influence is a demand of love, and no amount
of talking will explain it. I need her and she is there. I should perhaps
think of it explicitly more often.

In the afternoon, work takes up so much time, and there can be so muchjust
keeping the place clean is already a big task.Then there is wood to be chopped,
etc. The fire is voracious -- but pleasant company
