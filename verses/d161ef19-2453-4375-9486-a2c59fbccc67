The so-called scholars in hiding of ancient times did not conceal their
bodies and refuse to let them be seen; they did not shut in their words
and refuse to let them out; they did not stow away their knowledge and
refuse to share it. But the fate of the times was too much awry. If the
fate of the times had been with them and they could have done great
deeds in the world, then they would have returned to Unity and left no
trace behind. But the fate of the times was against them and brought
them only great hardship in the world, and therefore they deepened
their roots, rested in perfection, and waited. This was the way they
kept themselves alive.
