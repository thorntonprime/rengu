Title: Reconciliation
---
When conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;
This is dangerous.

The sage accepts less than is due
And does not blame or punish;
For harmony seeks agreement
Where justice seeks payment.

The ancients saidï¼š "nature is impartial;
Therefore it serves those who serve all."
