Whoever will be nurtured and trained up by Sophia, and learn to
understand and speak the language of wisdom, must be born again of and
in the Word of Wisdom, Christ Jesus, the Immortal Seed： The divine
essence which God breathed into his paradisical soul must be revived,
and he must become one again with that which he was in God before he
was a creature, and then his Eternal Spirit may enter into that which
is within the veil, and see not only the literal, but the moral,
allegorical, and anagogical meaning of the wise and their dark
sayings： He then will be fit to enter, not only into Solomon’s porch,
the outer court of natural philosophy, sense and reason, but likewise
into the inward court of holy and spiritual exercises, in divine
understanding and knowledge; and so he may step into the most inward
and holiest place of theosophical mysteries, into which none are
admitted to come, but those who have received the high and holy
unction.
