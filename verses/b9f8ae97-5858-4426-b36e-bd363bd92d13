Title: Rather
---
Come to me. If you don’t come, I’d rather you go.
This coming and going drains my life without giving me death.

If you reproach me, I'd rather you do it loudly.
Don't reproach me in silence -- silent reproaches pierce me
  like a needle of ice.

If you don't look at me, I'd rather you close your eyes.
Don't look askance at me -- sidelong glances wrap a gift of thorns
  in the cloth of love.
