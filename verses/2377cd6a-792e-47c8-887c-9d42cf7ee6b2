If you keep the juice of a lemon or a tamarind in a gold cup, this juice does
not spoil. In a cup of copper or brass on the contrary, it goes bad at once
and becomes noxious. In the same way, if sensual thoughts (vishaya vrittis)
enter the pure mind of someone who practices a constant meditation, they
cause no pollution nor any passional excitement. But if they come to persons
of impure mind, they cause excitement when they fasten on sense objects.
