In a universe thatâ€˜s in a constant state of becoming with nothing
permanent, who can say what is complete or incomplete? All we can really know
is how to practice that which appears before us. When one dharma appears,
one dharma is practiced. In this way, no person ever falls short of his
or her own completeness.
