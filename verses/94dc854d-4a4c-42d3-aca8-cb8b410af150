Title: That Shield You Hold
---
There is a shield you may still hold because of so many battles.

I guess another conflict could begin any moment, so maybe lugging it
about could be of some use; or is it just an undermining habit?

Does not it get heavy, so much so that you sometimes carry it on your
head at noon?

And then do wonder, with your insecurities so intact… about casting
darkness as fears can shadows

even if the sun is out, if the Sun is out—if God is really all around
in the middle of a beautiful day or night.

Yes, how amazing that a small umbrella or an illusion, held over your
head… or clung to, can hide the stupendous fact of omniscient Light.
