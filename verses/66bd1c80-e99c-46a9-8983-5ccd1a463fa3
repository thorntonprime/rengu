  Title: The Heart of God
Title: Worker of the Universe

It is only the revelation of You as the Infinite
that is endlessly new and eternally beautiful in us
and that gives the only meaning to our self
when we feel Your rhythmic throb as soul-life,
the whole world in our own souls;
then we are free.

O Worker of the Universe!
Let the irresistible current of Your universal energy come
like the impetuous south wind of spring;
let it come rushing over the vast field of human life.
Let our newly awakened powers cry out
for unlimited fulfillment in leaf and flower and fruit.
