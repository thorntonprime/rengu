Until we experience it,
Emptiness sounds so
Empty.

Once experienced,
All is empty by compatison.

This is no riddle.
It's just true.
A riddle is something the mind can eat and absorb.
This, for the mind is chewing gum and will eventually
be spit out.

Ptoooey!

It is then that
Emptiness might come
And we will be riddled
No more.
