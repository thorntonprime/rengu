Are the evils in the Universe necessary because it is of later origin than
the Higher Sphere?

Perhaps rather because without evil the All would be incomplete. For most or
even all forms of evil serve the Universe -- much as the poisonous snake has
its use -- though in most cases their function is unknown. Vice itself has
many useful sidesï¼š it brings about much that is beautiful, in artistic
creations for example, and it stirs us to thoughtful living, not allowing
us to drowse in security.
