Title: We Prescribe a Friend
---
We are wisdom and healing,
roasted meat and the star Canopus.
We are ground and the spilled wine sinking in.

When illness comes, we cure it.
For sadness, we prescribe a friend.
For death, a friend.

Run to meet us on the road.
We stay modest, and we bless.

We look like this, but this is a tree,
and we are morning wind in the leaves
that makes the branches move.

Silence turning now into this, now that.
