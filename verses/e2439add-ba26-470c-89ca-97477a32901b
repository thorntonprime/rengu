All Lust is Love degenerated. Love Corrupted. ...

Ixion in the Poets loved a Goddess, in the place of whom he embraced a
Cloud formed into the Shape of a Divine Beauty. Thus he became the
Father of the Centaures, half Men, half Beasts. Then he was cast into
hell where he is fastened to a Wheel turning continually round, on
which he is tormented day, and night. This Parable is meant of thee, O
Lustful Spiritï¼š Thou wert made for Divine Love, for the Love of the
Divine Beauty. Thus hast changed, this Love into various Lusts. Thou
defilest thy self with Shadows, Clouds of Darkness formed into the
Empty Shapes of Beauty. Instead of the Divine, and Humane Nature in
the Blessed Harmony of an Immortal Union, all thy Births, all thy
Production are Horrid hateful monsters; Man, Beast, and Devil all in
One Spirit, in One Person. Thy end is the Endless Circle of thy Lusts,
and of the Divine wrath, as the Wheel of Eternity, a Wheel of Fire,
holding thee fast tied to it, and torturing thee without any Rest, or
Period.
