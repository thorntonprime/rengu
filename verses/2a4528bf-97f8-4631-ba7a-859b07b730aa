Formerly, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamt that I was a butterfly, a butterfly flying
about, feeling that it was enjoying itself. I did not know that it was
Zhou. Suddenly I awoke, and was myself again, the veritable Zhou. I did not
know whether it had formerly been Zhou dreaming that he was a butterfly,
or it was now a butterfly dreaming that it was Zhou. But between Zhou and a
butterfly there must be a difference. This is a case of what is called the
Transformation of Things.'
