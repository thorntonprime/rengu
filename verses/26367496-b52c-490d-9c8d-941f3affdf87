To go by this road, and not another, I confide to theeï¼š
Observe but the traces o f my wheel.
And to impart throughout an equal heat.
Too precipitantly towards earth and sky neither mount nor descend.
For in mounting too high the sky thou wilt burn.
And in descending too low the earth thou writ destroy.
But if in the middle thy course remains.
The path is more united and the way more sure.
