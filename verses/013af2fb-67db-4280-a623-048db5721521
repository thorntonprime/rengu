Title: Wishing You Were Here
Description: August 5
---
Those kisses you sent, I found them wandering around the house. They were
 acting a little lost, not knowing exactly where I was.
I was busy upstairs. But now we are all having tea and talking about you,
 and wishing you were here.
And they imparted all you intended. They did well.
One more thingï¼š I have seen you at your best and at your worst; still you
 are always welcome near me.
