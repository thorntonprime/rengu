If you don't see the hidden River,
see how the waterwheel of stars continually turns.
If the heavens receive no rest from being moved by Love,
heart, don't ask for rest -- be a circling star.

Do you think God lets you cling to any branch?
Wherever you make an attachment, it will be broken.
Before God everything is like a ball,
subjected to and prostrating before the bat.

How should you, O my heart,
being only one of a hundred billion particles,
not be in restless movement at Love's command?
