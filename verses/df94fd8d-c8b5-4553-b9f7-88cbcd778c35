Knowing the masculine,
embrace the feminine.
Be a channel for all under heaven：
integrity will ever flow through you
and return you to the state of a newborn.
Knowing honor,
embrace humility.
Be a valley for all under heaven：
integrity will ever flow towards you
and return you to an unhewn block.
Knowing whiteness,
embrace the dark void.
Be a guide for all under heaven：
integrity will never mislead you
and will return you to the everlasting.

When hewn,
the native block is fashioned into tools,
tools which serve the interests of the few.
A wise man knows how not to hew.
