Title: Frying Tea at Zhaoqing
---
Great Superintendent Wang entered Zhaoqing (lit.
Incur-blessings) as tea was frying. At the time Upper-seat Lang was
together with Mingzhao and held the long-handle pan. Lang flipped over
the long-handle pan and expelled the tea.

The Great Superintendent saw and asked the Upper-seat,
What is under the tea stove?

Lang said, The spirit being holds up the stove in both
hands.

The Great Superintendent said, Since the spirit being
is already holding up the stove in both hands, why did you flip over
the long-handle pan and expel the tea?

Lang said, A government official of 1000 days loses in
one morning.

The Great Superintendent shook his sleeves then exited.

Mingzhao said, Upper-seat Lang, you have yet eaten
Zhaoqings cooked rice, yet you go to the other side of the river to
strike wild charcoal .

Lang said, Venerable, how do you make it alive?

Zhao said, The non-human gained its advantage.

Xuedou said, At that time however, one should have
stepped on and toppled the tea stove.
