Observe the three parts into which God has divided the first substance. Of the
first and pure part He created the Chérubin, Séraphin, Archangels, and all the
other angels. Out of the second, which was not so pure, He created the heavens
and all that belongs to them; of the third, impure part, the elements and their
properties.
