My home's a hole,
and a hole's where nothing is.
Pure, clean, emptiness, to venerate ...
A blazing flower of brightness, sun oh sun ...
Food? Wild plants will make this meager body
 maigre feast,
and a cotton robe's enough to robe illusion ...
Bring all your thousands of Sages, all sorts, here to
 meet me,
what's left of me, and the Heavenly Buddha!
