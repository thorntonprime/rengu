God then alone most perfectly and substantially enjoyeth Himself in the
contemplation of Himself, which is the Beatifical Vision of the most beautiful,
the most blessed Essence of Essences. This Act of Contemplation is an
Intellectual and Divine Generation, in which the Divine Essence, with an
eternity of most heightned Pleasures, eternally bringeth forth it self, within
it self, into an Image of it self.
