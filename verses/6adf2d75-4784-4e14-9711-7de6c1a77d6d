Title: What I Fear Most
---
There has to be a real fear by which one orients his life. What you fear
is an indication of what you seek. What do I fear most? Forgetting and
ignorance of the inmost truth of my being, To forget who I am, to be lost
in what I am not, to fail my own inner truth, to get carried away in what
is not true to me, what is outside me, what imposes itself on me from
outside, But what is this? It can take manifold forms, I must fear and
distrust them all. Yet I cannot help being to some extent influenced by
what is outside me, and hence I must accept that influence to some extent,
But always in such a way that it increases my awareness, my remembrance,
my understanding, instead of diminishing these.

Fear of ignorance in the sense of am'dya： the ignorance that is based
on the acceptance of an illusion about myself, The ignorance that comes
from the decision to regard my ego as my filll, complete, real self,
and to work to maintain this illusion against the call of secret truth
that rises up within me, that is evoked within me by others, by love,
by vocation, by providence, by suffering, by God, The ignorance that
hardens the shell, that makes the inner core of selfhood determined
to resist the call of truth that would dissolve it, The ignorance that
hardens in desire and willfulness, or in conformity, or in hate, or in
various refusals of people, various determinations to be “right at any
price” (the Vietnam War is a clear example of the American people’s
insistence on refusing to see human truth).
