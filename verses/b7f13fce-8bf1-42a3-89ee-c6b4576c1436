The soul is one with God and not united, so the scriptures say. For instance,
if we fill a tub of water the water in the tub is united and not one; what is
water is not wood and where it is wood it is not water. Now take the wood and
throw it in the middle of the water, the wood is still united, nothing more,
and not the same. It is different with the soul, she is one with God and not
united; where God is there is the soul and where the soul is there is God.
