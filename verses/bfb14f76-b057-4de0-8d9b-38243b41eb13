Title: This Place Where You Are Right Now
---
This place where you are right now, God circled on a map for you.

Wherever your eyes and arms and heart can move against the earth and
sky, the Beloved has bowed there,

the Beloved has bowed there knowing you were coming.

I could tell you a priceless secret about your real worth, dear
pilgrim,

but any unkindness to yourself, any confusion about others, will keep
one from accepting the grace,

the love, the sublime freedom Divine Knowledge always offers to you.

Never mind, Hafiz, about the great requirements this path demands of
the wayfarers,

for your soul is too full of wine tonight to withhold the wondrous
truth from this world. But because I am so clever and generous,

I have already clearly woven a resplendent lock of His tresses as a
remarkable gift in this verse for you.

This place where you are right now, God circled on a map. And
wherever, dear, you can move against

this earth and sky, the Beloved has bowed there, knowing, knowing you
were coming.
