\"O Wisest One, Mighty God Indra!” he cried, “this hound hath eaten with
me, starved with me, suffered with me, loved me! Must I desert him now?”

“Yea,” declared the God of Gods, Indra, “all the joys of Paradise
are yours forever, but leave here your hound.”

Then exclaimed Yudishthira in anguish.

“Can it be that a god can be so destitute of pity? Can it be that to
gain this glory I must leave behind all that I love? Then let me lose
such glory forever!" ...

The brow of Indra darkened.

“It is decreed," he replied sternly. “As you know, the very merit
of prayer itself is lost if a dog touches him who is praying. He who
enters Paradise must enter pure. Beside the stony highway you left the
wife Draupadi and your brothers. Surely for this common creature you will
not give up the joys of the Blessed!”

Gently Yudishthira laid his hand upon the hound’s head and turned
to depart.

“All powerful Indra,” he answered quietly, but firmly, "the dead are
dead; I could not succor them. There are four deadly sins： to reject a
suppliant, to slay a nursing mother, to destroy a Brahman’s possessions,
and to injure an old friend. But to these I add a fifth, as sinful：
to desert the lowliest friend when you pass out of sorrow into good
fortune! Farewell, then, Lord Indra. I go -- and my hound with me.”
