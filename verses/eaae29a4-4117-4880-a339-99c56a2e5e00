After having listened to him (William Penn) with great patience, they
(the Indians) answered： 'You bid us believe in the Creator and
Preserver of Heaven and Earth, though you do not believe in Him
yourself, nor trust in Him. For you have now made your own the land we
held in common amongst ourselves and our friends. You now take heed,
night and day, how you may keep it, so that no one may take it from
you. Indeed, you are anxious even beyond your span of life, and divide
it among your children. This manor for this child, that manor for that
child. But we have faith in God the Creator and Preserver of Heaven
and Earth. ... He preserveth us, and we believe and are sure that He
will also preserve our children after us, and provide for them, and
because we believe this, we bequeath them not a foot of land.’
