Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
Words are not just wind. Words have something to say. But if what they
have to say is not fixed, then do they really say something? Or do they
say nothing? People suppose that words are different from the peeps of
baby birds, but is there any difference, or isn't there? What does the
Way rely upon, that we have true and false? What do words rely upon,
that we have right and wrong? How can the Way go away and not exist?
How can words exist and not be acceptable? When the Way relies on
little accomplishments and words rely on vain show, then we have the
rights and wrongs of the Confucians and the Mo-ists. What one calls
right the other calls wrong; what one calls wrong the other calls
right. But if we want to right their wrongs and wrong their rights,
then the best thing to use is clarity.
