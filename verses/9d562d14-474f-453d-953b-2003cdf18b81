Title: A White Gull Heading East
Description: June 2
---
A sailor lost for days at sea in a boat all alone spots a white gull heading
  east at dawn,

and for a moment her sight becomes his. Things can happen like that; your soul
  can enter another -- that fully.

Land, land! he cried within, and then even tasted the earth in a way,

and so felt saved, as one might if one’s mouth touched God and all your hungers
  disappeared

for a blessed second, which can also occur while reading a half-decent poem,

so hope you find one somewhere. Don’t give up if this falls short.
