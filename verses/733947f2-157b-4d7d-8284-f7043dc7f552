Reflectï¼š is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar
things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?

I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.

But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute
beauty and is able to distinguish the Idea from the objects which participate
in the Idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the Idea nor the
Idea in the place of the objects -- is he a dreamer, or is he awake?
