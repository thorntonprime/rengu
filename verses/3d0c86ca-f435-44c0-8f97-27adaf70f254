For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no time
to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with malice and envy,
contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and
immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another, but all
in order moving according to reason; these he imitates, and to these he will,
as far as he can, conform himself.
