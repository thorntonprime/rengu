Title: Juzhi's One Finger
---
Venerable Juzhi, whenever he was questioned, simply stood
up one finger.

I am profoundly fond of old Juzhi for being one who
draws out the teachings.

The universe comes in emptiness, more than that who
exists?

Again and again, he has faced toward the blue sea and
dropped down driftwood

On the waves in the night to join in welcoming blind
turtles.
