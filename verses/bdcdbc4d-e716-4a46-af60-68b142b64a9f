If any man rail at thee and insult thee, answer him not. Instead be like one
who cannot be moved. Even thus shalt thou conquer him. For all who behold shall
declare that he who, in spite of provocation, holdeth his tongue is mightier
than he who provoketh. So shalt thou be respected by those who have wisdom.
