For in the world there can be constant naturalness. Where there is
constant naturalness, things are arced not by the use of the curve,
straight not by the use of the plumb line, rounded not by compasses,
squared not by T squares, joined not by glue and lacquer, bound not by
ropes and lines. Then all things in the world, simple and compliant,
live and never know how they happen to live; all things, rude and
unwitting, get what they need and never know how they happen to get
it. Past and present it has been the same; nothing can do injury to
this [principle]. Why then come with benevolence and righteousness,
that tangle and train of glue and lacquer, ropes and lines, and try to
wander in the realm of the Way and its Virtue? You will only confuse
the world!
