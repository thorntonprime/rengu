\'Be thou certain, none can perish, trusting Me,' says the Lord, but let
it not be understood to meann that our sins will be washed away by merely
trusting Him without any striving. Only he who struggles hard against the
allurements of sense objects and turns in tears and grief to the Lord will
be comforted.
