When I was a child, I thought,
Casually, that solitude
Never needed to be sought.
Something everybody had.
Like nakedness, it lay at hand,
Not specially right or specially wrong,
A plentiful and obvious thing
Not at all hard to understand.

Then, after twenty, it became
At once more difficult to get
And more desired -- though all the same
More undesirable; for what
You are alone has, to achieve
The rank of fact, to be expressed
In terms of others, or it’s just
A compensating make-believe.

Much better stay in company!
To love you must have someone else,
Giving requires a legatee,
Good neighbours need whole parishfuls
Of folk to do it on -- in short,
Our virtues are all social; if,
Deprived of solitude, you chafe,
It’s Clear you’re not the virtuous sort.

Viciously, then, I lock my door.
The gas-fire breathes, The wind outside
Ushers in evening rain, Once more
Uncontradicting solitude
Supports me on its giant palm;
And like a sea'anemone
Or simple snail, there cautiously
Unfo‘lds, emerges, what I am.
