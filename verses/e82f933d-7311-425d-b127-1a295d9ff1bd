  - Heaven & Hell
---
The Kingdom of Heaven is perfect trust, perfect knowledge, perfect peace. All
is music, sweetness, and tranquility. No irritations, no bad tempers,
no harsh words, no suspicions, no lust, and no disturbing elements can
enter there. ... It is literally true that when men die they “go to
heaven and hell,” in accordance with their deeds. But the heaven and
hell are in this world.
