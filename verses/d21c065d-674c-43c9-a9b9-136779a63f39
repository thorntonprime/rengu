It is good to have a reminder of death before us, for it helps us to
understand the impermanence of life on this earth, and this
understanding may aid us in preparing for our own death. He who is
well prepared is he who knows that he is nothing compared with
Wakan-Tanka, who is everything; then he knows that world which is
real.
