All this God doth, that he may eternally display the unsearchable Riches of
that Variety which is in himself, that he may swallow up the Understanding
of every Creature, Man or Angel, into an admiration and adoration of the
incomprehensibleness of his Wayes, his Wisdom, his Blessedness and Glory, who
at once bringeth forth these Varieties (which like Morning Stars and Sons of
God in the purest unmixt Light and Love, dance and sing together in his Bosom)
into such fighting Contrarieties, upon the stage of the earthly and created
Image here below, making that the seat of deformity, shame, woe and death,
while it figureth out the highest Joys and Glories of eternal Life above, who
again gathers up all those jarring and tumultuous Contrarieties into the first
state and supream Unity, where the Variety is far more vast and boundless in
the whole, far more full and distinct in every branch of it, where the whole
is all, an eternal Melody, an eternal Beauty, an eternal Joy.  unexpressibly
Divine, pure and ravishing, where each branch, in its own distinct Form,
is a Beauty, a Melody, a Joy, equally pure, perfect and ravishing with the
whole, being crowned with the Unity and Eternity, which is the Highest Unity.
