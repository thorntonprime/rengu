Title: Of the meditations of them that continually travail in the work of
  this book
---
But it is not so with them that continually work in the work of this book. For
their meditations be but as they were sudden conceits and blind feelings
of their own wretchedness, or of the goodness of God; without any means of
reading or hearing coming before, and without any special beholding of any
thing under God. These sudden conceits and these blind feelings be sooner
learned of God than of man. I care not though thou haddest nowadays none
other meditations of thine own wretchedness, nor of the goodness of God (I
mean if thou feel thee thus stirred by grace and by counsel), but such as
thou mayest have in this word SIN, and in this word GODï¼š or in such other,
which as thee list. Not breaking nor expounding these words with curiosity
of wit, in beholding after the qualities of these words, as thou wouldest by
that beholding increase thy devotion. I trow it should never be so in this
case and in this work. But hold them all whole these words; and mean by sin,
a lump, thou wottest never what, none other thing but thyself. Me think that
in this blind beholding of sin, thus congealed in a lump, none other thing
than thyself, it should be no need to bind a madder thing, than thou shouldest
be in this time. And yet peradventure, whoso looked upon thee should think
thee full soberly disposed in thy body, without any changing of countenance;
but sitting or going or lying, or leaning or standing or kneeling, whether
thou wert, in a full sober restfulness.
