Wang Ni replied, "The Perfect Man is godlike. Though the great swamps
blaze, they cannot burn him; though the great rivers freeze, they
cannot chill him; though swift lightning splits the hills and howling

the clouds and mist, straddles the sun and moon, and wanders beyond the
four seas. Even life and death have no effect on him, much less the
rules of profit and loss!"
