Soul becomes free when it moves without hindrance, through
Intellectual-Principle.  towards The Good; what it does in that spirit
is its free act; Intellectual-Principle is free in its own right This
state of freedom belongs in the absolute degree to the Eternals in
right of that eternity and to other beings in so far as without
hindrance they possess or pursue The Good which, standing above them
all, must manifestly be the only good they can reasonably seek. ...

Certainly there can be no subjection whatever in That to which reality
owes its freedom.  That in whose nature the conferring of freedom must
clearly be vested, pre-eminently to be known as the Liberator. ...
Even self-mastery is absent here, not that anything else is master
over it but that self-mastery begins with Being while the Supreme is
to be set in a higher order Where we speak of self-mastery there is a
certain duality. Act against essence.
