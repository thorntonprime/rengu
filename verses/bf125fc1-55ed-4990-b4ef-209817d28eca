Title: Great Big Little Hut
Commentary: |
  This last poem, was by the monk Ts’an Liao Tzu ( c.1077 ) one of the
  best friends of one of China’s great (some say greatest) lay poets,
  Su Shih (aka Su Tung-p’o), who was, like a lot of people then and now,
  also a lay practitioner of Zen. Like Su Shih, Ts’an Liao was a sharp wit
  and a crafty wordsmith. This poem was certainly meant to be witty. It’s
  not easy in the original.

One hut-full of
Universe： so where’s the
“little” come in? That rare guy, inside：
empty, whole without
even one single speck
of dirt.
