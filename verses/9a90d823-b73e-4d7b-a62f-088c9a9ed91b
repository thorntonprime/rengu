There are some persons, though very few such are found, who, subduing
their pleasures and neglecting public affairs, conduct their life in
such a way that they burn with eagerness to attain truth; but they do
not have faith that it can be investigated through its human traces,
in which the ambiguous minds of most natural philosophers are
accustomed to trust. Therefore they give themselves to God and do not
attempt anything by themselves. With open and purified eyes they wait
for what may be shown by God. and this is what Socrates is said to
have taught and to have done.
