By the light of mind the human soul is illumined, as the world is illumined
by the sun -- nay, in yet fuller measure. For all things on which the sun
shines are deprived of his light from time to time by the interposition of
the earth, when night comes on; but when mind has once been interfused with
the soul of man, there results from the intimate blending of mind with soul
a thing that is one and indivisible, so that such men's thought is never
obstructed by the darkness of error.
