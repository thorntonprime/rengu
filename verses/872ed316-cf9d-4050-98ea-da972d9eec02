Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
The hundred joints, the nine openings, the six organs, all come
together and exist here [as my body]. But which part should I feel
closest to? I should delight in all parts, you say? But there must be
one I ought to favor more. If not, are they all of them mere servants?
But if they are all servants, then how can they keep order among
themselves? Or do they take turns being lord and servant? It would seem
as though there must be some True Lord among them. But whether I
succeed in discovering his identity or not, it neither adds to nor
detracts from his Truth.
