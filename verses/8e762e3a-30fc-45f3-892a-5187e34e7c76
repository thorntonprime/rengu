The matter of this world is the materiality of the Kingdom of Heaven, brought
down into a created state of grossness, death, and imprisonment, by occasion
of the sin of those angels who first inhabited the place or extent of this
material world. Now these heavenly properties which were brought into this
created compaction lie in a continual desire to return to their first state
of glory; and this is the groaning of the whole creation to be delivered from
vanity which the Apostle speaks of.
