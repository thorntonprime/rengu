And when he (Apollonius) had taken his seat, he (a Brahman sage) said：
‘Ask whatever you like, for you find yourself among people who know
everything.’ Apollonius then asked him whether they knew themselves
also, thinking that he, like the Greeks, would regard self-knowledge as a
difficult matter. But the other, contrary to Apollonius’ expectations,
corrected him and said： ‘We know everything, just because we begin by
knowing ourselves; for no one of us would be admitted to this philosophy
unless he first knew himself.’ And Apollonius remembered what he had heard
Phraotes say, and how he who would become a philosopher must examine himself
before he undertakes the task ; and he therefore acquiesced in this answer,
for he was convinced of its truth in his own case also.
