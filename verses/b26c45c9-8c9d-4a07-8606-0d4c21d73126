Lord,

  Where there is hate, let me bring Love --
  Where there is offence, let me bring Pardon --
  Where there is discord, let me bring Union --
  Where there is error, let me bring Truth --
  Where there is doubt, let me bring Faith --
  Where there is darkness, let me bring Light --
  Where there is sadness, let me bring Joy.

May it be, O lord, that I seek not so much to be consoled as to console, to be
understood as to understand, to be loved as to love; because it is in giving
oneself that one receives; it is in forgetting oneself that one is found; it is
in pardoning that one obtains pardon; it is in dying that one is raised up to
eternal life.
