If the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not
only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but of
eternity! And the danger of neglecting her from this point of view
does indeed appear to be awful. If death had only been the end of all,
the wicked would have had a good bargain in dying, for they would have
been happily quit not only of their body, but of their own evil
together with their souls.  But now, inasmuch as the soul is
manifestly immortal, there is no release or salvation from evil except
the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom.
