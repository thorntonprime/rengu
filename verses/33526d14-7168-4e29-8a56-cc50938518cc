What do I mean by a True Man? The True Man of ancient times did not
rebel against want, did not grow proud in plenty, and did not plan his
affairs. A man like this could commit an error and not regret it, could
meet with success and not make a show. A man like this could climb the
high places and not be frightened, could enter the water and not get
wet, could enter the fire and not get burned. His knowledge was able to
climb all the way up to the Way like this.
