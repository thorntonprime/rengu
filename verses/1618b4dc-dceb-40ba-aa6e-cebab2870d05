After passing the six centres (of Yoga) the aspirant arrives at the seventh
plane. Reaching it, the mind merges in Brahman. The individual soul and the
Supreme Soul become one. The aspirant goes into sam√¢dhi. His consciousness
of the body disappears. He loses the knowledge of the outer world. He does
not see the manifold any more. His reasoning comes to a stop.
