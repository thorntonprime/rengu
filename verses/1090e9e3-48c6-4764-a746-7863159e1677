The courtesan Bindumati caused the river Ganges to flow back upstream.
After she had performed the feat King Asoka said to her：

‘You possess the Power of Truth! You, a thief, a cheat, corrupt, cleft
in twain, vicious, a wicked old sinner who have broken the bonds of
morality and live on the plunder of fools.’

‘It is true, your Majesty; I am what you say. But even I, wicked woman
that I am, possess an Act of Truth by means of which, should I so
desire. I could turn the world of men and the worlds of the gods
upside down.'

Said the king, ‘But what is this Act of Truth? Pray enlighten me.'

‘Your Majesty, whosoever gives me money, be he a Khattiya or a
Brâhmana or a Vessa or a Sudda or of any other caste soever, I treat
them all exactly alike. If he be a Khattiya. I make no distinction in
his favor. If he be a Sudda. I despise him not.  Free alike from
fawning and contempt, I serve the owner of the money. This, your
Majesty, is the Act of Truth by which I caused the mighty Ganges to
flow back upstream.'
