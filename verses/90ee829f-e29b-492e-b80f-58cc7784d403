\"However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the
difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on
what I'm doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest
subtlety, until - flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of
earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look
all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then
I wipe off the knife and put it away."
