Title: Acquiring Followers
---
The man acquires followers who flatter, scheme, and act subservient to seek
personal gains, There is a chance that he will become dependent on them
because of gratifying associations, which will detract from his authority
in his position of influence, He must see through such adherents and free
himself from egotistical encumbrances.
