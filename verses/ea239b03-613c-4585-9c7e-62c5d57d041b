All things have an origin.
The origin could be called the Mother.
When you know the Mother,
You can know the child.
When you know the child,
Return to clasp the Mother,
And you’ll find no danger
To the end of your life.
Block up the openings.
Shut the doors,
And you’ll not fail
To the end of your life.
Unblock the openings,
Add to your problems,
You’ll be beyond help
To the end of your life.
To see the subtle is called discernment.
To hold to the weak is called strength.
Use discernment but return to the light.
This is called pursuing the constant.
