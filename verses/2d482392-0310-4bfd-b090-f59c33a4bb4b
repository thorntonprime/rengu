Chuang Tzuï¼š "The Way gave him a face; Heaven gave him a form. He
doesn't let likes or dislikes get in and do him harm. You, now - you
treat your spirit like an outsider. You wear out your energy, leaning
on a tree and moaning, slumping at your desk and dozing - Heaven picked
out a body for you and you use it to gibber about `hard' and `white'!"
