They will ask thee of the mountains. Say： My Lord will break them into
scattered dust.

And leave it as an empty plain,

Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness.

On that Day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are hushed
for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur.
