Title: \"I" and "You"
---
“I” and “you” are but the lattices
In the niches of a lamp,
Through which the One Light shines.

“I” and “you” are the veil
Between heaven and earth;
Lift this veil and you will see
No longer the bond of sects and creeds.

When “I” and “you” do not exist,
What is mosque, what is synagogue?
What is the Temple of Fire?
