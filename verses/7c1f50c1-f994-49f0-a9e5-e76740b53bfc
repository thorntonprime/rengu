Title: Belonging Entirely to God
---
Certainly the solitary life makes sense only when it is centered
on one thing： the perfect love of God. Without this, everything is
triviality. Love of God in Himself, for Himself sought only in His will, in
total surrender. Anything but this, in solitude, is nausea and absurdity. But
outside of solitude, one can be occupied in many things that seem to have
and do have a meaning of their own.And their meaning can be and is accepted,
at least provisionally, as something that must be reckoned with until such
time as one can come to love God alone perfectly, etc. This is all right
in a way, except that, while doing things theoretically “for the love of
God,” one falls in practice into complete forgetfulness and ignorance and
torpor. This happens in solitude, too, of course, but in solitude, while
distraction is evidently vain, forgetfulness brings nausea. But in society,
forgetfulness brings comfort of a kind.

It is therefore a great thing to be completely vulnerable and to feel at
once, with every weakening of faith, a total loss.Things that in community
are legitimate concerns are seen in solitude to be also temptations, test,
questionings： for instance, the skin trouble on my hands.
