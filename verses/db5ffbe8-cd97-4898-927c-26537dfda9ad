The Shaikh (may God be well pleased with him) says in the Fass i Shu'aibi, that
the universe consists of accidents all pertaining to a single substance, which
is the Reality underlying all existences. This universe is changed and renewed
unceasingly at every moment and at every breath. Every instant one universe is
annihilated and another resembling it takes its place, though the majority of
men do not perceive this, as God most glorious has said： ‘But they are in doubt
regarding the new creation’ (Qur’ân, L. 15).  ...  They have not grasped the
fact that the universe, together with all its parts, is nothing but a number of
accidents, ever changing and being renewed at every breath, and linked together
in a single substance, and at each instant disappearing and being replaced by a
similar set.  In consequence of this rapid succession, the spectator is
deceived into the belief that the universe is a permanent existence.
