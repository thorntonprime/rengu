\"The Way is without beginning or end, but things have their life and
death - you cannot rely upon their fulfillment. One moment empty, the
next moment full - you cannot depend upon their form. The years cannot
be held off; time cannot be stopped. Decay, growth, fullness, and
emptiness end and then begin again. It is thus that we must describe
the plan of the Great Meaning and discuss the principles of the ten
thousand things. The life of things is a gallop, a headlong dash - with
every movement they alter, with every moment they shift. What should
you do and what should you not do? Everything will change of itself,
that is certain!"
