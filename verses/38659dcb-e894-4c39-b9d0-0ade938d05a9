Abbot Nisteron the Elder, walking in the desert with a hermit, met a
dragon and fled.  Upon which the brother said to him： “How now, my
Father, are you afraid?’ “No. brother.' replied this holy man： ‘but I
am obliged to flee the sight of this dragon, because I have not virtue
enough to put the demon of vanity to flight.’
