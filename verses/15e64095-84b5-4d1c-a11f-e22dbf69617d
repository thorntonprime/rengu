The strange thing about this crisis of August, 1939 was that the object
between Germany and Poland was not clearly defined, and could not therefore
be expressed as a concrete demand. It was part of Hitler’s nature to
avoid putting things in a concrete form; to him differences of opinion
were questions of power and tests of one’s nerves and strength.
