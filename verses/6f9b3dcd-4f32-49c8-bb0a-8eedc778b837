Don’t.
Don’t look at me and pretend not to see.
Don’t.
Don’t seal your lips and speak with your eyes.
Don’t.
Don’t cry in cool embarrassment after smiling
 in the warmth of love.
Don’t.
Don't tremble with excitement when picking the flowers of the world.
Don’t.
A smile is dancing in the breast of my destiny.
Don’t be timid all over again.
