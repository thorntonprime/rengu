Our Conversation is in Heaven, according to the Measure and Degree of our
present State and Condition. ...

Our Conversation is in Heaven Exemplariter & Secundum Normam, viz. As we make
Heaven the Sampler, and Copy, after which we write. And this is that which
our Saviour hath taught us to pray, that God's will may be done on Earth,
as it is done in Heaven. When we set our selves to do the Will of God here,
then Heaven is come down into the World; when we endeavour to do the Will
of God, desire to do it.
