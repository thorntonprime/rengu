Title: God Is All in Christ
---
Went out to work clearing brush near the lake by the Bardstown Road
yesterday and got my eyes infected. Conjunctivitis, they say. During
the night office and especially during my Mass it was extremely painful
today. Now I know what Gerard Manley Hopkins was talking about when, after
correcting hundreds of exam papers, he said he felt as ifhis eyes were
full oflemonjuice. Got the thing fixed up with ointment and even bandaged,
and it was better. Practically no reading all day -- spent a lot of time
“empty” and it was a happy, salutary day -- a gift from God!

One thing Christ has said： “He who sees me sees the Father also.”

In emptying Himself to come into the world, God has not simply kept His
reality in reserve, in a safe place, and manifested a kind of shadow or
symbol of Himself. He has emptied Himself and is all in Christ. Christ is
not simply the tip of the little finger of the Godhead, moving in the world,
easily withdrawn, never threatened, never really risking anything. God
has acted and given Himself totally. He has become not only one of us
but even our very selves.
