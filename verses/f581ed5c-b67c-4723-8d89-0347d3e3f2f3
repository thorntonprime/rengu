In the month too hot for working in the fields,
every manâ€™s good to share a drink with.
So I lay out all kinds of mountain fruits
with a wall of wine cups to guard 'em,
with rushes laid out for a mat,
and big banana leaves for plates.
When you're drunk, and settled there, propped up,
Great Mount Sumeru's just a little stick.
