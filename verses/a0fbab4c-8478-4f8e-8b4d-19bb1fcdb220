Description: Bengali Song

Why should I go to Gangâ or Gayâ. to Kâsi. Kânchi. or Prabhâs.
So long as I can breathe my last with Kâli’s name upon my lips?
What need of rituals has a man. what need of devotions any more.
If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours?
Rituals may pursue him close, but never can they overtake him.
Charity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan's mind;
The Blissful Mother’s Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and sacrifice.
Who could ever have conceived the power Her name possesses?
Siva Himself, the God of Gods, sings Her praise with His five mouths!
