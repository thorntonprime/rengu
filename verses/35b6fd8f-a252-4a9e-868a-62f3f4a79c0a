  - Body: I saw there was a great crack to go throughout the earth, and
      a great smoke to go as the crack went; and that after the crack there
      should be a great shaking： this was the earth in people’s hearts,
      which was to be shaken before the seed of God was raised out of the
      earth. And it was so; for the Lord's power began to shake them, and
      great meetings we began to have, and a mighty power and work of God
      there was amongst people, to the astonishment of both people and
      priests.

And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the
pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
