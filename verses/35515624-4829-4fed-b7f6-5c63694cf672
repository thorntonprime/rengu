The rectitude of Reason, was the Image of God, the Crowne, and Glory of Man. By
this Knowl.  he grew up streight in the midst of the Creatures; uniting
heightning them all by a 761 Harmony into the same Image. So he subdued them to
himselfe, himselfe with them ascended into, and rested in the Divine Image.

Thus Man was the true Orpheus with his Divine Hymnes in the midst of Beasts,
Trees, Beauty and Stones dancing to his Musick.
