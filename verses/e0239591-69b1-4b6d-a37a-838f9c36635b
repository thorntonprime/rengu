The sleeping Father is here changed
Entirely into limpid water.
And by virtue of this water alone
The good work is accomplished.
There is now a glorified and beautiful Father.
And he brings forth a new Son.
The Son ever remains in the Father.
And the Father in the Son.
Thus in divers things
They produce untold, precious fruit.
They perish never more.
And laugh at death.
