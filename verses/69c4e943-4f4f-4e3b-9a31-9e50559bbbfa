Conformity consists in this, that we unite our will to Godâ€™s will;
but uniformity means more -- it requires that we make our will one with
the Divine will, so that we desire nothing but what God desires, and will
nothing but what God wills. This is the sum and substance of that perfection
to which we should aspire.
