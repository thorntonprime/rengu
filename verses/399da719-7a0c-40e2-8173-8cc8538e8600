Title: In Case Someone Is Spying
Description: September 16
---
I better sound smart once in a while, in case someone is spying.
What if the truth got out that I really prefer silliness and silence to
 offering fancy clues to the universe?
Maybe I could accomplish both at the same time the way that Hoopoe over
 there appears
to be doing ... as it scratches the ground looking for a bug in a way that
 might amuse the casual onlooker,
but at the same time is really sending out some covert Morse code
that could have catastrophic results, if I donâ€™t act soon to counterbalance
 things.
Maybe the moon is really a top secret agent, up to no good? And has fooled
 us all ... for thousands of years.
