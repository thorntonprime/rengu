Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
The Yellow Emperor had ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years and
his commands were heeded throughout the world, when he heard that
Master Kuang Ch'eng was living on top of the Mountain of Emptiness and
Identity. He therefore went to visit him. "I have heard that you, Sir,
have mastered the Perfect Way. May I venture to ask about the essence
of the Perfect Way?" he said. "I would like to get hold of the essence
of Heaven and earth and use it to aid the five grains and to nourish
the common people. I would also like to control the yin and yang in
order to insure the growth of all living things. How may this be done?"
