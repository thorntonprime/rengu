Title: Once the Nobleman Returned
---
Once the nobleman returned
from that far, distant
land, at once
strange to him, at
once too-familiar, ahhh,
he lost all taste
for the life he knew.
All he wanted was to go back
once again
to that distant country.
He'd become a ruler of a kingdom
of nothing,
but everything.
