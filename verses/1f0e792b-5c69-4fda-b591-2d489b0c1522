  - Beauty-Peace=The Surface Of The Waters=The Spirit Upon the Waters
By: St Thomas Aquinas
---
The Spirit of God, it is said, moved over the waters -- that is to say, over
that formless matter, signified by water, even as the love of the artist moves
over the materials of his art. ... According to the holy writers, the Spirit of
the Lord signifies the Holy Ghost, Who is said to move over the water -- that
is to say, over what Augustine holds to mean formless matter. ... It is the
opinion ... of Basil that the Spirit moved over the element of water, fostering
and quickening its nature and impressing vital power, as the hen broods over
her chickens.
