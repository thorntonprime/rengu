In the very overcoming of temptation ... we may draw out a hidden spiritual
sweetness, as the bees suck honey from the thorn-bushes as well as from all
other flowers. He who has not been tempted, knows nothing, nor lives as yet,
say the wise man Solomon, and the holy teacher St Bernard. We find more than a
thousand testimonies in Scripture to the great profit of temptation; for it is
the special sign of the love of God towards a man for him to be tempted and yet
kept from falling; for thus he must and shall of a certainty receive the crown
(James, I. 12).
