Lao Tan lay dead
Chin Shih attended the wake.
He let out three yells
And went home.

One of the disciples said：
Were you not the Master's friend?
"Certainly," he replied.

"Is it then sufficient for you
To mourn no better than you have just done?"

"In the beginning," said Chin Shih, "I thought
He was the greatest of men.
No longer! When I came to mourn
I found old men lamenting him as their son,
Young men sobbing as though for their mother.
How did he bind them to himself so tight, if not
By words he should never have said
And tears he should never have wept?

"He weakened his true being,
He laid on load upon
Load of emotion, increased
The enormous reckoning：
He forgot the gift God had entrusted to him：
This the ancients called 'punishment
For neglecting the True Self.

"The Master came at his right time
Into the world. When his time was up,
He left it again.
He who awaits his time, who submits
When his work is done,
In his life there is no room
For sorrow or for rejoicing.
Here is how the ancients said all this
In four words：
  'God cuts the thread.'

"We have seen a fire of sticks
Bum out. The fire now
Bums in some other place. Where?
Who knows? These brands
Are burnt out."
