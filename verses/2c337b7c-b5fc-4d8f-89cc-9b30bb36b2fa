Title: Seeing Her Off
---
She’s leaving.
She doesn’t want to go, and I don’t want to send her away.
But she’s leaving.
I had thought beautiful her red lips, white teeth, and fine brows,
but her departing cloud of hair, willowy waist, and pearl-smooth heels
 are more so.

Step by step she grows distant -- now out of sight, now seen.
The further she gets, the closer our hearts;
The closer our hearts, the further is she.
I thought I saw her waving kerchief, but it was a slip of cloud
 smaller than a flying gull.
