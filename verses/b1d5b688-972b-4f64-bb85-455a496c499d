There should be Truth in thought, Truth in speech, and Truth in action. To
the man who has realized this Truth in, perfection, nothing else remains
to be known, because all knowledge is necessarily included in it. What is
not included in it is not Truth and so not true knowledge; and there can
be no inward peace without the true knowledge. If we once learn how to
apply this never-failing test of Truth, we will at once be able to find
out what is worth being, what is worth seeing and what is worth reading.
