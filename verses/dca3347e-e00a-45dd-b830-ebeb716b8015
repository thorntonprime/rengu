When a man is always occupied with the cravings of desire and
ambition, and is eagerly striving to satisfy them, all his thoughts
must be mortal, and, as far as it is possible altogether to become
such, he must be mortal every whit, because he has cherished his
mortal part. But he who has be√ßn earnest in the love of knowledge and
of true wisdom, and has exercised his intellect more than any other
part of him. must have thoughts immortal and divine ... since he is
ever cherishing the divine power, and has the divinity within him in
perfect order.
