The monks of the West Hall and the East Hall were arguing over a cat.

Master Nanquan held up the cat in his left hand and a knife in his right
hand, and said, “Say a word and I'll spare the cat.“

No one could speak; Nanquan cut the cat in two.

Later Zhaozhou, who was away, returned, and Nanquan told him the problem
and asked him what he would have done.

Zhaozhou took off his sandals, put them on his head, and walked away.

Nanquan said, “Alas! If you had been here I could have spared the cat."

Tell me, what is the magic in Zhaozhou's placing the sandals on his head
and walking out? And why did Nanquan feel that Zhaozhou's answer would
have allowed him to spare the cat?
