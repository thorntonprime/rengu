Title: Truth Does Not Like Business Deals
---
When I seek what You alone
can give; what I find is my seeking,

like the wager of a business deal
in which I hope for payment for

my efforts, but You who are always
already within me do not seek me,

and so You do not desire my finding
but seek rather the emptiness by which

I might unclutter my life of all that
I am, even my faith, even my desire

to seek You, for this You cannot resist.
