A foolish man learning that the Buddha observed the principle of great
love which commends the return of good for evil, came and abused him. The
Buddha was silent, pitying his folly.

When the man had finished his abuse, the Buddha asked him, saying：
“Son, if a man declined to accept a present made to him, to whom would
it belong?” And he answered： “In that case it would belong to the
man who offered it.”

"My son,” said the Buddha, “thou hast railed at me, I decline to accept
thy abuse, and request thee to keep it thyself. Will it not be a source
of misery to thee? As the echo belongs to the sound, and the shadow to
the substance, so misery will overtake the evil-doer without fail.”

The abuser made no reply, and Buddha continued： “A wicked man who
reproaches a virtuous one is like one who looks up and spits at heaven; the
spittle soils not the heaven but comes back and defiles his own person.”
