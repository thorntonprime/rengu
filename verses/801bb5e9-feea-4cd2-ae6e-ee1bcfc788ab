What is so much in the mind as the mind itself? But because it is in those
things which it thinks of lovingly, and is lovingly habituated to sensible,
that is corporeal things, it is unable to be in itself without the images
of those corporeal things. Hence shameful error arises to block the way,
whilst it has not the power to separate itself from the images of sensible
things, so as to see itself alone. For they have marvellously cohered with
it by the strong bond of love. And herein consists its uncleanness; since,
while it strives to think of itself alone, it fancies itself to be that,
without which it cannot think of itself. When therefore it is bidden to get to
know itself, let it not seek itself as though it were withdrawn from itself,
but let it withdraw that which it has added to itself.
