Title: Your Heart
---
I’ve seen the blackness of your brow and the shapeliness of your ears.
But I haven’t seen your heart.
When you wrapped the large red apple you picked for me,
I saw your heart go in it.

I’ve seen your round belly and your slender waist.
But I haven’t seen your heart.
When you saw my picture next to that of another woman,
I saw the greenness of your heart.

I’ve seen the whiteness of your nails and the curve of your heels.
But I haven’t seen your heart.
When you put my jeweled ring in your pocket as you left,
I saw your heart hiding behind the ring, covering its face.
