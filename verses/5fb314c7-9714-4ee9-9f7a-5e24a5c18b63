Title: Something Must Have Spooked Him
---
He was gallivanting about and seemed to be having a grand time,
when something must have spooked Him, and He jumped back into a hole inside
 of me.
I have been pining ever since, at the rim of many universes,
not really knowing what to do, wanting to see God and me so happy like that
 again, chasing each other around.
