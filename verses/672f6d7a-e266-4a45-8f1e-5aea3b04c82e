When he (the being) thus departs from this body, then he ascends upward with
these very rays of the sun. With the thought of Om, verily, he passes up. As
quickly as one could direct his mind to it, he comes to the sun. That, verily,
indeed, is the world-door, an entrance for knowers, a stopping for non-knowers.

As to this there is the following verse： --

  There are a hundred and one channels of the heart.
  One of these passes up to the crown of the head.
  Going up by it, one goes to immortality.
  The others are for departing in various directions.
