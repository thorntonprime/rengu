Then one came to me, radiant as the sun so that I might think he was
an angel. He brought me a gleaming book and said, ‘Take the Pax, since
thou mayest not come to the Mass.’ But my soul spoke with modest
wisdom, ‘He who himself has no peace, can give me no peace.’ Then he
went away and disguised himself as a poor sick man and said, ‘Thou who
art holy, heal me!’ But I said, ‘He who is sick himself can help no
one!’ ‘But it is written, Whosoever can, shall help others.’ ‘It is
also written： One shall help no one against the will of God.’ ‘But to
do good,’ he said, ‘is not against the will of God.’ But I said, ‘To
him in whom there is no good, no one can do good. Thou hast an eternal
sickness. If thou wouldst be healed thou must go and show thyself to a
Priest or Archbishop or the Pope.  For I myself have no power save to
sin.’ Then he said angrily, ‘That I will never do!’ and became as
black smoke and withdrew himself rudely and went away. But I was not
afraid of him.
