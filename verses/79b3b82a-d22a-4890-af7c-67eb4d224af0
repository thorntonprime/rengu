Life is a series of choices and nobody can stop you from making your
choices. ... People punish themselves by making wrong choices. Constantly,
enlightenment is being offered to them, but they refuse to accept it.
Therefore, people are being taught by problems that are set before them,
since they refuse to make right choices voluntarily.
