There is a brighter ether than this blue
  Pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,
  Royaler investiture than this massed assault
Of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.
Immortal spaces of caerulean hue
  Are in our reach and fields without this fault
  Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
In their deep murmur which white flowers strew

Floating like stars upon a strip ofsky.
  This world behind is made of truer stuff
    Than the manufactured tissue of earth’s grace.
There we can walk and see the gods go by
  And sip from Hebe’s cup nectar enough
    To make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face.
