According to the Perfection in which God knoweth Himself, and enjoyeth
Himself, so is the Perfection of this Image (of Himself)- As those (Images
of things) are, so is this clear, distinct and full. The more distinct the
beam is from the first Light in its emanation, the more strong and full is
the reflection. This Divine Image then is at once most perfectly distinct
from its Divine Original, most exactly equal to it, and most perfectly
one with it. As then God is, so is this essential, eternal Image of God,
a compleat and distinct Person in it self, in every point with the highest
and most ravishing agreeableness, answering the Divine Essence in its spring
out of which it ariseth.

If this Image were not a Compleat Person, Gods knowledge and fruition of
Himself would be incompleat, without the pleasing and proportionate returns of
an equal Loveliness, Life and Love. If this Image were not perfectly distinct
from the bosome out of which it flourisheth, the knowledge and enjoyment
of God would be confused, more like to the blindness, the barrenness, the
cold of darkness and death, than the life and fruitfulness, the warmth of
beauty, life and love, which all have their Perfection and their Joyes in
the propagation of themselves into most distinct forms, and the reflection
upon themselves from these forms.

This is the first, and so the most universal Image, the first seat of all
Images of things.
