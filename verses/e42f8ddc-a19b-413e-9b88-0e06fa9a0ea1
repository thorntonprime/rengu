God and nature makes nought superfluous, but all that comes into being
is for some function. For no created being is a final goal in the
intention of the Creator, as Creator： but rather is the proper
function of that being the goal. Wherefore it comes to pass that the
proper function does not come into existence for the sake of the
being, but the latter for the sake of the former.
