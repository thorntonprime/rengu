Title: A Woman He Held
---
Something beautiful, that old green boat moving slowly in the water.
Something exquisite, that man rowing while a woman he has held intimately
 hundreds of times sits near and rests.
Rests from the wars in the days. Rests from the wars in the hours. But now,
 more than to just relax; she smiles, deeply brightens and comes alive
as the wing of a duck, landing on the other side of the pond, gently touches
 her cheek. Yes.
It all seems perfectly natural, realizing that all dimensions will someday
 admit ... we are your subjects, mere peasants within your vast kingdom.
All of God, which is everything, is really so close, and caresses us now
 and then if your senses are alert.
The falcon's wing, on my better days, crafts these images as I watch.
