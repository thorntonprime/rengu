Son, when thou art quiet and silent, then art thou as God was before nature
and creature; thou art that which God then was; thou art that whereof he
made thy nature and creature; Then thou hearest and seest even with that
wherewith God himself saw and heard in thee, before ever thine own willing
or thine own seeing began.
