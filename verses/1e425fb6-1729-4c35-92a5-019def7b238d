  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
Pretended,
And the cause is manifest.
When she was a girl she showed
Candor, and excellent qualities;
But you, wishing to see
Greater perfection in her,
Harshly and inflexibly set out
To correct her slightest faults;
You shouted at her; she did
Nothing that suited you.
Your severity produced in her
Only dissimulation, and cunning;
Your oppression, a greater desire
For freedom. The frequency
Of punishment produced fear,
And lacking true virtues,
Virtues that you were unable
To inspire in her, she
Pretended to possess them.
You made her hypocritical and false;
And as soon as she acquired skill
In deceiving her father,
She deceived him so completely
That only when she had the most vices
Did he believe she was perfect.
