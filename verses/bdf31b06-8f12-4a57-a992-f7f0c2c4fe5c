Title: Baptized by Darkness
---
The darkness is thinning and expects the sun. Birds begin to sing. No
Mass. Everything is waiting for the Resurrection.

At the end of the night office, when the whole choir sank into the
darkness of death and chanted without the faintest light, I thought of
the darkness as a luxury, simplifying and unifying everything, hiding
all the accidents that make one monk different from another monk, and
submerging all distinctions in plain obscurity. Thus we are all one in
the death ofChrist.The darkness that descends upon us at the end of Lauds
hears us sing the Benedictus, the canticle of thanksgiving for the Light
who is to be sent. Now He is sent. He has come. He has descended into
the far end of night, gathered our Fathers, the Patriarchs and Prophets,
to Himself in Limbo. Now we will all be manifest.We will see one another
with white garments, with palm branches in our hands. The darkness is
like a font from which we shall ascend washed and illumined, to see one
another, no longer separate, but one in the Risen Christ.
