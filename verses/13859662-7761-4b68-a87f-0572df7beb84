What are the eighteen special dharmas of a Buddha? From the night when the
Tathagata knew full enlightenment, to the day when he becomes extinct in
Nirvana, during all this time, the Tathagata：

 1. Does not stumble,
 2. He is not rash or noisy in his speech,
 3. He is never deprived of his mindfulness,
 4. He has no perception of difference,
 5. His thought is never unconcentrated,
 6. His evenmindedness is not due to lack of consideration,
 7. His zeal never fails,
 8. His vigour never fails,
 9. His mindfulness never fails,
 10. His concentration never fails,
 11. His wisdom never fails,
 12. His deliverance never fails,
 13. All the deeds of his body are preceded by cognition, and continue to
conform to cognition,
 14. All the deeds of his voice are preceded by cognition, and continue to
conform to cognition,
 15. All the deeds of his mind are preceded by cognition, and continue to
conform to cognition,
 16. His cognition and vision regarding the past period of time proceeds
unobstructed and freely,
 17. His cognition and vision regarding the future period of time proceeds
unobstructed and freely,
 18. His cognition and vision regarding the present period of time proceeds
unobstructed and freely.
