Be the first to forgive, to smile and take the first step, and you will see
happiness bloom. ... Be always the first. Do not wait for others to forgive,
for by forgiving, you become the master of fate, the fashioner of life, the
doer of miracles. To forgive is the highest, most beautiful form of love.
In return you will receive untold peace and happiness.
