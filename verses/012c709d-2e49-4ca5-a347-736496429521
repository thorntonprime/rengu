Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher

\"Goodness, how could that be? Anyway, you aren't the man to do it. Now
there's Pu-liang Yi - he has the talent of a sage but not the Way of a
sage, whereas I have the Way of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I
thought I would try to teach him and see if I could really get anywhere
near to making him a sage. It's easier to explain the Way of a sage to
someone who has the talent of a sage, you know. So I began explaining
and kept at him for three days,  and after that he was able to put
the world outside himself. When he had put the world outside himself, I
kept at him for seven days more, and after that he was able to put
things outside himself. When he had put things outside himself, I kept
at him for nine davs more, and after that he was able to put life
outside himself. After he had put life outside himself, he was able to
achieve the brightness of dawn, and when he had achieved the brightness
of dawn, he could see his own aloneness. After he had managed to see
his own aloneness, he could do away with past and present, and after he
had done away with past and present, he was able to enter where there
is no life and no death. That which kills life does not die; that which
gives life to life does not live.  This is the kind of thing it isï¼š
there's nothing it doesn't send off, nothing it doesn't welcome,
nothing it doesn't destroy, nothing it doesn't complete. Its name is
Peace-in-Strife. After the strife, it attains completion."
