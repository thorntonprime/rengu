Divine truth hath its humiliation and exinanition, as well as its
exaltation. Divine truth becomes many times in Scripture incarnate, debasing
itself to assume our rude conceptions, that so it might converse more freely
with us, and infuse its own divinity into us. God having been pleased herein
to manifest himself not more jealous of his own glory, than he is (as I may
say) zealous of our good. Nos non habemus aures, sicut Deus habet linguam. If
he should speak in the language of eternity, who could understand him, or
interpret his meaning? or if he should have declared his truth to us only in
a way of the purest abstraction that human souls are capable of, how should
then the more rude and illiterate sort of men have been able to apprehend
it? Truth is content, when it comes into the world, to wear our mantles,
to learn our language, to conform itself as it were to our dress and fashions.
