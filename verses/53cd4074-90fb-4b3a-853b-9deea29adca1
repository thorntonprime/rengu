Title: I Like Musicians
---
Wise the beggar or the thief who can get a coin from my purse, for it will
  multiply, it could turn into emerald worlds.
But what you get from me needs to be held and not quickly spent. Some kind of
  incubation is required.
How can you do that? If you slow your mind down and keep your aim steady on the
  present a heat in your gaze will occur,
something you want to see that was hiding in the invisible will begin to step
  forward, and grow.
Instead of stealing from me, you should knowï¼š I like musicians, and will offer
  freely to their hat.
