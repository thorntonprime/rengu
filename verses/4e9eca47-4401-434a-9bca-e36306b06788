Title: Imagination Does Not Exist
---
For me, and for the one who is One with God, imagination does not
exist.

Whatever you might be able to do in a dream, or in thought or fantasy,

I could literally pull from my pocket, or just make appear in my hand.

What kind of world is this then that we live in?

It has been make-believe since the beginning and does not know any
other way to act.
