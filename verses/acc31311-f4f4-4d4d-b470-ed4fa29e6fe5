\"Don't you know how the tiger trainer goes about it? He doesn't dare
give the tiger any living thing to eat for fear it will learn the taste
of fury by killing it. He doesn't dare give it any whole thing to eat
for fear it will learn the taste of fury by tearing it apart. He gauges
the state of the tiger's appetite and thoroughly understands its fierce
disposition. Tigers are a different breed from men, and yet you can
train them to be gentle with their keepers by following along with
them. The men who get killed are the ones who go against them.
