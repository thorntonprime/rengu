We are coming to the end of the line personally and globally through our
rejection of the feminine side of God. Addicts manifest an extreme form of
this desecration in our culture, but they are also potential catalysts for
the rebirth of the feminine. Not only are they individuals carrying the
unconscious of their forebears. As human beings in the history of mankind
they are also living out what is unconscious in the social environment. We
can remain blind to our personal shadow until we look into the starving
eyes of an anorexic or alcoholic we love; we can also remain blind to the
collective shadow until we turn on television and look into the eyes of
a starving child.

In a technological civilization geared up for its own heady destruction, we
are destined to become the victims of an outworn patriarchal consciousness
so long as we collude in equating femininity with biological identity. That
kind of consciousness is propelling not only individuals but the whole
planet into an addiction to power and perfection which, viewed from the
perspective of nature, can lead only to suicide. Feminine consciousness
dare not be limited to unredeemed matter or unconscious mother. The
realization that a neurosis has a creative purpose applies globally as
well as personally, and surely, in an age addicted to power and the
acquisition of material possessions, the creative purpose must have
something to do with the one thing that can save us -- love for the earth,
love for each other -- the wisdom of the Goddess. Responsibility belongs
in the individual home, in the individual heart, in the energy that holds
atoms together rather than blows them apart.
