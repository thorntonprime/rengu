Title: Curing Hemorrhoids
By: Hakuin Ekaku
Commentary: |
  This unique and surprising painting is one of Hakuin's rare works in color.
  and we can see some of his preliminary outlines before he completed the work.
  A homely geisha with “long life" inscribed on her robe applies moxa to an
  old man with the word “money” on his jacket, Moxa is a powdered medicine,
  pressed into cones and burned on the skin to draw out noxious elements It is
  usually applied on the back, but here it reaches toward his nether parts
  while he screws up his eyes and faces the final word of the calligraphy,
  “fire”.

It seems he has hemorrhoids --
So I give him one touch of fire.
