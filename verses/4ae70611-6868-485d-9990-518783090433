Title: Who should work in the gracious work of this book
---
First and foremost, I will tell thee who should work in this work, and when,
and by what meansï¼š and what discretion thou shalt have in it. If thou
asketh me who shall work thus, I answer thee -- all that have forsaken
the world in a true will, and thereto that give them not to active life,
but to that life that is called contemplative life. All those should work
in this grace and in this work, whatsoever that they be; whether they have
been accustomed sinners or none.
