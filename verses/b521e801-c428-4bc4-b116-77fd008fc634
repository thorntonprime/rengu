The virtue of Heaven and Earth, the powers of the Sage, and the uses
of the myriad things in Creation, are not perfect in every direction.
It is Heaven’s function to produce life and to spread a canopy over
it. It is Earth’s function to form material bodies and to support
them. It is the Sage’s function to teach others and to influence them
for good. It is the function of created things to conform to their
proper nature.
