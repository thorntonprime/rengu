The divine Plato knew that there are three kinds of Sirens; the celestial,
which is under the government of Jupiter; that which produces generation, and
is under the government of Neptune; and that which is cathartic, and is under
the government of Pluto. It is common to all these to incline all things
through an harmonic motion to their ruling Gods. Hence, when the soul is in the
heavens, the Sirens are desirous of uniting it to the divine life which
flourishes there. But it is proper that souls living in generation should sail
beyond [the Sirens under the domination of Neptune], like the Homeric Ulysses,
that they may not be allured by generation, of which the sea is an image. And
when souls are in Hades, the Sirens are desirous of uniting them through
intellectual conceptions to Pluto. So that Plato knew that in the kingdom of
Hades there are Gods, daemons, and souls, who dance as it were round Pluto,
allured by the Sirens that dwell there.
