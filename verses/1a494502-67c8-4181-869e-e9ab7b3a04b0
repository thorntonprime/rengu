How great the Way,
like nothing else!
If it were not beyond compare,
how common it would be.

These treasures three--
empathy,
economy,
humility--
cherish them and hold them close.
Now,
through empathy, one conquers fear.
Through economy, one gives forth.
Through humility, one stewards all.
But courage absent empathy,
generosity absent economy,
leadership absent humility,
invites death within.

Through empathy one wins a war.
Through empathy secure a land.

What heaven brings forth,
compassion sustains.
