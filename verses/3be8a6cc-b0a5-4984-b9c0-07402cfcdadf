Title: Paradise in the Thornbush
---
The spring air is beautiful.
It flows down from the plum branch I thought dead,
its beadlike buds nourished by the melting snow.
In another patch of sky, do you know an unknown fragrance
 flows from decaying snow bringing death to all flowers?
The clouds are thin; the stream is shallow; the autumn hills are empty.
But between gaunt rocks, the red maple flames in brilliance.
It too sings and cries,
Do you know such “life of nature” is given by the mature shade
 of summer
and disappears into memory in autumn’s wind?

A blade of grass becomes the six-foot golden Buddha,
and the six-foot golden Buddha becomes a blade of grass.
The entire world is one nest, and all things a little bird.
I saw life reflected in the mirror of nature.
I was happy to leave you to tend the garden ofjoy
behind the thornbush of pain.
