Not to know It is to know It; to know It is not to know It. But how is one
to understand this, that it is by not knowing It that It is known? This
is the way, says the Primordial State. The Principle cannot be heard; that
which is heard is not It. The Principle cannot be seen; that which is seen
is not It. The Principle cannot be uttered; that which is uttered is not
It. ... Concerning the Principle, one can neither ask nor reply what It is.
