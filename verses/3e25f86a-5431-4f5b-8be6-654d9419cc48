Baofu and Changqing hiked to the rest stop on the mountain.
Fu using his finger to point said, "Just this place on the side then is
the summit of wonder."

Qing said, "It is the norm as it is, but a pity to admit
it.

Xuedou attached words saying, "Today, sharing a hike on the
mountain with these fellows, what is there in particular to seek?"

Again he said, "A hundred thousand years afterwards, I do
not say without any, only they are few."

Afterwards it was raised to show Jingqing. Qing said, "If
not for Grandfather Sun, then one would see skulls throughout the
countryside."
