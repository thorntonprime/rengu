We do not know all the laws of God nor their working. Knowledge of the
tallest scientist or the greatest spiritualist is like a particle of
dust. If God is not a personal being for me like my earthly father,
He is infinitely more. He rules me in the tiniest detail of my life. I
believe literally that not a leaf moves but by His will. Every breath I
take depends upon His sufferance.
