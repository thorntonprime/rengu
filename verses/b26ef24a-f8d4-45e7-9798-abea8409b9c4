Those who dream of the banquet, wake to lamentation and sorrow. Those who
dream of lamentation and sorrow wake to join the hunt. While they dream, they
do not know that they dream. Some will even interpret the very dream they are
dreaming; and only when they awake do they know it was a dream. By and by
comes the Great Awakening, and then we Ã±nd out that this life is really a
great dream. Fools think they are awake now, and flatter themselves they know
if they are really princes or peasants.  Confucius and you are both dreams;
and I who say you are dreams, -- I am but a dream myself.
