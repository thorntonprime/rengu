Anticipating favor brings distress.
To guard against disgrace gives stress no less.
Best be startled by neither.

Misery befalls the self.
No self, no misery.
Just so for rank and misfortune.

Who does not rank himself above all else,
may be entrusted with an empire.
Who graces all creatures as himself,
may be given custody of the world.
