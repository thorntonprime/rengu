If you call it a staff, you’re caught up in the words and ideas that
describe it. If you say it‘s not a staff, you negate its existence. Without
resorting to speech or silence, tell me, quickly, what is it? This is
about arriving at the place of no-mind. No-mind is always this very moment,
this very reality. Let go of all ideas, and tell me, what is it?
