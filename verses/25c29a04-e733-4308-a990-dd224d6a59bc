Title: Nanquan's Fundamental Dharma
---
Nanquan visited Venerable Baizhang Neipan. Zhang asked,
"All sages accord with the superior, still is there a fundamental
Dharma that they have not spoken for people?"

Quan said, "There is."

Zhang said, "How do you make it alive 'the fundamental
Dharma that is not spoken for people'?"

Quan said, "It is not Heart-Mind; it is not Buddha; it is
not things."

Zhang said, "You have spoken too."

Quan said, "I am only like this. Venerable,
how do you make it come alive?"

Zhang said, "I actually am not very good at knowledge, and
I struggle to know if there is speaking or there is not speaking."

Quan said. "I have not learned this."

Zhang said, "Having spoken too, I am excessive for you."
