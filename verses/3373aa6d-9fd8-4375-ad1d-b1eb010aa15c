Contrary to legend, sitting long periods ofzazen does not create hemorrhoids.
In spite of the belief that moxa works, fire will not cure hemorrhoids, though
it will surely create a sense ofhell, l lakuin's imagery notwithstanding.
there is ultimately no relationship between the "money" on the jacket of the
old man and the "long life" on the jacket of the geisha. Aside from this,
there is no other truth to be seen.
