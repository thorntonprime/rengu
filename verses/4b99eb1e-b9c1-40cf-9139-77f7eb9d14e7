Commentary: |
  To those who will not admit morality without a deity to validate
  it, or spirituality of which man is not the measure, the firmness
  of Lao Tzu’s morality and the sweetness of his spiritual counsel
  must seem incomprehensible, or illegitimate, or very troubling
  indeed.
Title: Returning to the Root
---
Be completely empty. Be perfectly serene.
The ten thousand things arise together;
in their arising is their return.
Now they flower,
and flowering
sink homeward,
returning to the root.

The return to the root
is peace.
Peace： to accept what must be,
to know what endures.
In that knowledge is wisdom.
Without it, ruin, disorder.

To know what endures
is to be openhearted,
magnanimous,
regal,
blessed,
following the Tao,
the way that endures forever.
The body comes to its ending,
but there is nothing to fear.
