I do not say it is the Linga,
I do not say it is oneness with the Linga,
I do not say it is union.
I do not say it is harmony.
I do not say it has occurred.
1 do not say it has not occurred.
I do not say it is You.
I do not say it is I.
After becoming one with the Liñga
  in Chenna Mallikârjuna.
I say nothing whatever.
