Title: No Expectations
---
A spirit that lives in this world
and does not wear the garment of love,
such an existence is a deep disgrace.

Be foolishly in love,
because love is all there is.
There is no way into presence,
except through a love exchange.

If someone asks, But what is love?
Answer, Dissolving the will.

True freedom comes to those who have escaped
the questions of freewill and fate.

Love is an emperor.
The two worlds play across him.
He barely notices their tumbling game.

Love and lover live in eternity.
Other desires are substitutes for that way of being.

How long do you lay embracing a corpse?
Love rather the soul, which cannot be held.

Anything born in spring dies in fall,
but love is not seasonal.

With wine pressed from grapes,
expect a hangover.

But this path has no expectations.
You are uneasy riding the body?
Dismount. Travel lighter.
Wings will be given.

Be clear like a mirror reflecting nothing.
Be clean of pictures
and the worry that comes with images.

Gaze into what is not ashamed
or afraid of any truth.

Contain all human faces in your own
without any judgment of them.

Be pure emptiness.
What is inside that? you ask.
Silence is all I can say.
Lovers have some secrets that they keep.
