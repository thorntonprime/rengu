In the days of Ho Hsu, people stayed home but didn't know what they
were doing, walked around but didn't know where they were going. Their
mouths crammed with food, they were merry; drumming on their bellies,
they passed the time. This was as much as they were able to do. Then
the sage came along with the crouchings and bendings of rites and
music, which were intended to reform the bodies of the world; with the
reaching-for-a-dangled-prize of benevolence and righteousness, which
was intended to comfort the hearts of the world. Then for the first
time people learned to stand on tiptoe and covet knowledge, to fight to
the death over profit, and there was no stopping them. This in the end
was the fault of the sage.
