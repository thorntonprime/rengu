Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
\"Suppose you and I have had an argument. If you have beaten me instead
of my beating you, then are you necessarily right and am I necessarily
wrong? If I have beaten you instead of your beating me, then am I
necessarily right and are you necessarily wrong? Is one of us right and
the other wrong? Are both of us right or are both of us wrong? If you
and I don't know the answer, then other people are bound to be even
more in the dark. Whom shall we get to decide what is right? Shall we
get someone who agrees with you to decide? But if he already agrees
with you, how can he decide fairly? Shall we get someone who agrees
with me? But if he already agrees with me, how can he decide? Shall we
get someone who disagrees with both of us? But if he already disagrees
with both of us, how can he decide? Shall we get someone who agrees
with both of us? But if he already agrees with both of us, how can he
decide? Obviously, then, neither you nor I nor anyone else can decide
for each other. Shall we wait for still another person?
