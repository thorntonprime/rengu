Our blessedness does not depend on the deeds we do,
but rather on our passiveness to God.

For as God is more exhaulted than creatures,
so his work is higher than mine.

Indeed, out of his unmeasurable love
Fod has set our blessedness in passivity,
in bearing rather than doing,
and incomparably more in receiving than giving.

Each of his gifts only prepares us afresh to receive another,
a new gift, and more and more gifts.

Each divine gift only increases our sensitivity
and desite to receive another, which is greater still.

On this point, some of the authoritues say that in this way
the soul is made equal to God.
For just as there is no end to God's gifts,
there is no end to the soul's power to receive them.

As God is almighty in action,
the soul is boundless in its capacity to take,
and thus it is transformed with God and in God.

It is necessary that God should both be active and passive
in order that he may know and love himself in the soul,
and the soul mau know as he knows
and love as he loves.

It is for this reason that the soul is more blessed
by what is His than by what is its own,
and for this reason its blessing depends
more on what He does than on anything we can do.
