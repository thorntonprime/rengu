Ecstatic experience will be described in some or most of the following
termsï¼š

feelings of a new life, another world, satisfaction, joy, salvation,
glory; of new and/or mystical knowledge; of loss of words, images,
sense; of unity, eternity, heaven; of up feelings; of contact; of loss
of worldliness, desire, sorrow, sin; of enlargement and improvement; of
loss of self; of inside feelings; ofloss offeelings ofdflierence, time,
place, oflight and/or fire feelings; of peace and calm; of liquidity;
of ineffability; of release; of pain.

To believe one has had some or most of these feelings is belief warranted by
ecstatic experience. If we were to postulate the most probable unwarranted
beliefs that would be held as a result of ecstatic experience, we could
reasonably surmise that they would include belief in the existence of a
joyful and satisfactory condition in which, purified, one could enter
a glorious new world or life; in which one gained ineffable knowledge
aided by losing the impediment of normal perceptions; in which all was
timelessly one; in which worldliness, desire, sorrow, sin were unknown; to
which one was raised or elevated; in which one made contact with Someone or
Something or everyone or everything; by which one was enlarged or improved;
to which all differences, all divisions or time, all localized places
were irrelevant; by which one was illumined and warmed; was at peace;
felt a beneficial flow; endured delicious pain.
