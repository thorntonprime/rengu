In the Great Beginning, there was nonbeing; there was no being, no
name. Out of it arose One; there was One, but it had no form. Things
got hold of it and came to life, and it was called Virtue. Before
things had forms, they had their allotments; these were of many kinds,
but not cut off from one another, and they were called fates. Out of
the flow and flux, things were born, and as they grew they developed
distinctive shapes; these were called forms. The forms and bodies held
within them spirits, each with its own characteristics and limitations,
and this was called the inborn nature. If the nature is trained, you
may return to Virtue, and Virtue at its highest peak is identical with
the Beginning. Being identical, you will be empty; being empty, you
will be great. You may join in the cheeping and chirping and, when you
have joined in the cheeping and chirping, you may join with Heaven and
earth. Your joining is wild and confused, as though you were stupid, as
though you were demented. This is called Dark Virtue. Rude and
unwitting, you take part in the Great Submission.
