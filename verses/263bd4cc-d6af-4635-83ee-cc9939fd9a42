The little boat of St. Peter is beaten by many storms and tossed about upon
the sea, but it grieves me most of all that, against the orthodox faith,
there are now arising, more unrestrainedly and injuriously than ever before,
ministers of diabolical error who are ensnaring the souls of the simple
and ruining them. With their superstitions and false inventions they are
perverting the meaning of the Holy Scriptures and trying to destroy the
unity of the Catholic Church. Since ... this pestilential error is growing
in Gascony and the neighboring territories, we wish you and your fellow
bishops to resist it with all your might. ... we give you a strict command
that, by whatever means you can, you destroy all these heresies and expel
from your diocese all who are polluted by them. ... if necessary, you may
cause the princes and people to suppress them with the sword.
