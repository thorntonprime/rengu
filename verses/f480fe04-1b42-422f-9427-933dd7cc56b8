Title: The Peace of Being Nothing Special
---
It seems to me that I have greater peace and am close to God when I am
not “trying to be a contemplative,” or trying to be anything special,
but simply orienting my life fully and completely towards what seems to be
required of a man like me at a time like this.

I am obscurely convinced that there is a need in the world for something
I can provide and that there is a need for me to provide it. True, someone
else can do it, God does not need me. But I feel He is asking me to provide it.

At the consecration of my Mass I suddenly thought of the words： “If you
love me, feed my sheep!”

The wonder of being brought, by God, around a corner and to realize a new
road is opening up, perhaps -- which He alone knows. And that there is no
way of traveling it but in Christ and with Him. This is joy and peace --
whatever happens. The result does not matter. I have something to do for Him
and, if I do that, everything else will follow. For the moment, it consists
of prayer -- thought -- study, and above all care to form the South American
postulants as He brings them to Gethsemani.
