The Pythagoreans said, that an harmonic sound is produced from the motion of
the celestial bodies; and they scientifically collected this from the analogy
of their intervals; since not only the ratios of the intervals of the sun and
moon, and Venus and Mercury, but also of the other stars, were discovered by
them.
