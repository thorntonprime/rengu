Who more than Basil honored virtue or punished vice? Who evinced more
favor toward the rightdoing, or more severity toward offenders -- he whose
very smile was often praise; whose silence, reproof, in the depths of
conscience reaching and arousing the sense of guilt? Grant that he was no
light prattler, no jester, no lounger in the markets. Grant that he did not
ingratiate himself with the multitude by becoming all things to all, and
courting their favor： what then? Should he not, with the right judging,
receive praise for this rather than condemnation? Is it deemed a fault
in the lion that he has not the look of an ape; that his aspect is stern
and regal; that his movements, even in sport, are majestic, and command
at once wonder and delight? Or do we admire it as proof of courtesy and
true benevolence in actors that they gratify the populace, and move them
to laughter by mutual blows on the temple, and by boisterous merriment?
