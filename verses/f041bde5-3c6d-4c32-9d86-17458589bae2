I sit beneath the cliff, quiet and alone.
Round moon in the middle of the sky's a bird
 ablazeï¼š
all things are seen mere shadows in its brilliance,
that single wheel of perfect light ...
Alone, its spirit naturally comes clear.
Swallowed in emptiness in this cave of darkest
 mystery,
because of the finger pointing, I saw the moon.
That moon became the pivot of my heart.
