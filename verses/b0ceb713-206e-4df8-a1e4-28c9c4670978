Om! -- This imperishable syllable is this whole world.

Its further explanation is：

The past, the present, the future -- everything is just the word Om.

And whatever else that transcends threefold time -- that, too, is just the
word Om. ...

This is the Self with regard to the word Om, with regard to its elements. The
elements (mâtra) are the fourths; the fourths, the elements; the letter a,
the letter u, the letter m.

The waking state, the Common-to-all-men, is the letter a, the first element,
from âpti (‘obtaining’) or from âdimatvâ (‘being first’).

He obtains, verily, indeed, all desires, he becomes first -- he who knows this.

The dream state, the Brilliant, is the letter u, the second element, from
utkarsa (‘exaltation’) or from ubhayatvâ (‘intermediateness’).

He exalts, verily, indeed, the continuity of knowledge; and he becomes
equal (samâna); no one ignorant of Brahma is born in the family of him who
knows this.

The deep-sleep state, the Cognitional, is the letter m, the third element,
from miti (‘erecting’) or from apiti (‘immerging’).

He, verily, indeed, erects (minoti) this whole world, and he becomes its
immerging-he who knows this.

The fourth is without an element, with which there can be no dealing, the
cessation of development, benign, without a second.

Thus Om is the Self (Âtman) indeed.

He who knows this, with his self enters the Self -- yea, he who knows this!
