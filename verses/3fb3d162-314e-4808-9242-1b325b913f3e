Who understand others has knowledge.
Who understands himself is enlightened.
Who overcomes others has power.
Who overcomes himself has strength.
Who values just what suffices is rich.
Who perseveres has strength of purpose.
Who finds where he belongs, endures.
Who leaves memories when he dies, lives on.
