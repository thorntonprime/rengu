Title: Perplexities and New Births
---
The sun is rising, All the green trees are full of birds, and their song
comes up out of the wet bowers of the orchard, Crows swear pleasantly
in the distance, and in the depths of my soul sits God, and between Him,
in the depths and the thoughts on the surface of my mind, is the veil of
an unresolved problem.

What shall I say this problem is? It is not a conflict of ideas, It
is not a dilemma, I do not believe it is a question of choice, Is it a
psychological fact? Any interior problem is a psychological fact, Is it
a question that I can resolve? No.

This problem is my own personality, in which I do not intend at any time
to take an unhealthy interest, But (I speak as one less wise) this problem
is my personality or, if you like, the development of my interior life,
I am not perplexed either by what I am or what I am not, but by the mode
in which I am tending to become what I really will be.

God makes us ask ourselves questions most often when He intends to resolve
them, He gives us needs that He alone can satisfy and awakens capacities
that He means to fulfill, Any perplexity is liable to be a spiritual
gestation, leading to a new birth and a mystical regeneration.
