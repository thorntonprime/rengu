\"Take a saint for a friend," said P'u-shang,
"but if he's not a saint, let that be the end of it."

"If you are good, you'll find others so;
if not, then, maybe no,"said Tzu-chang,
and then went on,
"Praise the skilled; console those without it;
good men will surround you."

Follow the fine strong words of Tzu-chang ...
Reject the selfish P'u-shang's petty drivel.
