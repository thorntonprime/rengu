Good travelers leave no tracks. Good words leave no trace. Good counting
 needs no markers.
Good doors have no bolts Yet cannot be forced. Good knots have no rope But
 cannot be untied.
In this way the Sage Always helps people And rejects none, Always helps all
 beings, And rejects none. This is called practicing brightness.
Therefore the good person is the bad person's teachers, And the bad person
 Is the good person's resource.
Not to value the teacher, Not to love the resource, Causes great confusion
 even for the intelligent. This is called the vital secret.
