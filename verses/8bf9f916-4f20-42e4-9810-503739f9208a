In roving through the universe, lucky is the man who gets the seed of
the creeper of faith through the grace of his guru and Krishna. He
sows the seed like a gardener, waters it with hearing and chanting
(the Holy Name). As the creeper grows it pierces through the universe,
passes beyond the Birajâ Brahma world to the Para-byom, and above that
to the heavenly Brindâban, where it creeps up the wishing-tree of
Krishna’s feet, spreads and bears fruit in the form of love. ... If
any sin against Vaishavisin is done, it uproots or tears any creeper
like a wild elephant, its leaves wither. Then the gardener on earth
carefully covers it, to save it from the elephant of sin. But if
parasites, like love of enjoyment or ...  thirst of gam or fame,
adhere to the creeper, -- then these parasites flourish from the
watering, while the main creeper’s growth is arrested. Cut off the
parasites first; then will the main branch reach the heavenly
Brindâban. When the mature fruit of love drops down, the gardener
tastes it, and proceeding up the creeper he reaches the wishing-tree.
