After this, Lieh Tzu concluded that he had never really begun to learn
anything. He went home and for three years did not go out. He
replaced his wife at the stove, fed the pigs as though he were feeding

the carving and polishing and returned to plainness, letting his body
stand alone like a clod. In the midst of entanglement he remained
sealed, and in this oneness he ended his life.
