Just as crystal, which is clear, becomes coloured from the colour of another
object, so likewise the jewel of the mind becomes coloured with the colour
of mental conceits. Like a jewel the mind is naturally free from the colour
of these mental conceits; it is pure from the beginning, unproduced,
immaculate and without any self-nature.
