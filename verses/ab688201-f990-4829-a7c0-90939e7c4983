The trees of the New mountain were once beautiful. Being situated, however,
in the borders of a large state, they were hewn down with axes and bills; --
and could they retain their beauty? Still through the activity of the
vegetative life day and night, and the nourishing influence of the rain
and dew, they were not without buds and sprouts springing forth, but then
came the cattle and goats and browsed upon them. To these things is owing
the bare and stript appearance of the mountain, which when people see, they
think it was never finely wooded. But is this the nature of the mountain?

And so also of what properly belongs to man -- shall it be said that the mind
of any man was without benevolence and righteousness? The way in which a
man loses his proper goodness of mind is like the way in which the trees
are denuded by axes and bills. Hewn down day after day, can it -- the mind --
retain its beauty? But there is a development of its life day and night,
and in the calm air of the morning, just between night and day, the mind
feels in a degree those desires and aversions which are proper to humanity,
but the feeling is not strong, and it is fettered and destroyed by what
takes place during the day. This fettering taking place again and again,
the restorative influence of the night is not sufficient to preserve the
proper goodness of the mind; and when this proves insufficient for that
purpose, the nature becomes not much different from that of the irrational
animals, which when people see, they think that it never had those powers
which I assert. But does this condition represent the feelings proper to
humanity?
