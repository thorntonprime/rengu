    Title: Does God Exist?
By: Hans Kung
---
God is not neuter, not an “it,” but a God of men, who provokes the decision
for belief or unbelief. He is spirit in creative freedom, the primordial
identity of justice and love, one who faces me as founding and embracing all
interhuman personality. If, with the religious philosophers of the East, we
want to call the absolutely last and absolutely first reality the “void”
or “Absolute Nothingness," then we must also call it “being itself," which
manifests itself with an infinite claim and with infinite understanding. It
will be better to call the most real reality not personal or nonpersonal but --
if we attach importance to the terminology -- transpersonal or suprapersonal.
