One authority says that no one is so foolish that he does not desire wisdom.
Why, then.  are we not all wise? Because so much is required to that end. The
principal requirement is that one shall get beyond phenomenal nature and in
this process he begins soon to be weary. Then he lags behind with his little
wisdom, a little man. That I am a wealthy man does not mean that I am wise too,
but when my nature is conformed to Godâ€™s Being, so that I am wisdom itself,
then only am I a wise man.
