Whether the legislator is establishing a new state or restoring an old
and decayed one, in respect of Gods and temples if he be a man of
sense, he will make no change in anything which the oracle of Delphi,
or Dodona, or the God Ammon, or any ancient tradition has sanctioned
in whatever manner, whether by apparitions or by inspired words from
Heaven, in obedience to which mankind have established sacrifices in
connection with mystic rites, either originating on the spot, or
derived from Tyrrhenia or Cyprus or some other place, and on the
strength of which traditions they have consecrated oracles and images,
and altars and temples, and portioned out a sacred domain for each of
them. The least part of all these ought not to be disturbed by the
legislator. ... There should be one law.  which will make men in
general less liable to transgress in word or deed, and less foolish,
because they will not be allowed to practise religious rites contrary
to law. ... Gods and temples are not easily instituted, and to
establish them rightly is the work of a mighty intellect.
