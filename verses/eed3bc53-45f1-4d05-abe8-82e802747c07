---
Longing to pray is praying, and without it the soul is dead.
Even as you pray, something ineffable will stir your longing
  for something ineffable.
Just keep doing this work, more and more.

Let God's grace do with you what it wants.
Let it lead you wherever it wishes.
Let it work and you receive.
Look on it, watch it, and leave it alone.
Don't meddle with it, trying to help, as if you could assist grace.
Fear that your interference could wreck everything.

Be the tree, and let love be the carpenter.
Be the house, and let love be the homeowner dwelling within.
Become blind, and cut yourself off from needing to know things.
Be content feeling moved in a delightful, loving way
 by something mysterious and unknown,
leaving you focused entirely on God, with no other thought.
Let your naked desire rest there.
