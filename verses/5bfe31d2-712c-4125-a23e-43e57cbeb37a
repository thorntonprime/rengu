Jesu, who always showest thyself unto us -- for this is thy will, that we
should at all times seek thee, and thyself hast given us this power, to ask
and to receive, and hast not only permitted this, but hast taught us to pray;
who art not seen of our bodily eyes, but art never hidden from the eyes of
our soul. ...
