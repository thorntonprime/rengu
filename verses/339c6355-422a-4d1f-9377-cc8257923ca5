Our life is not a mutual helpfulness; but rather, cloaked under the due
laws-of-war, named “fair competition” and so forth, it is a mutual
hostility. We have profoundly forgotten everywhere that Cashpayment is
not the sole relation of human beings; we think, nothing doubting, that it
absolves and liquidates all engagements of man. “My starving workers?”
answers the rich mill-owner. " Did not I hire them fairly in the market? Did
I not pay them, to the last sixpence, the sum covenanted for? What have 1 to
do with them more?” -- Verily Mammon-worship is a melancholy need. When
Cain, for his own behoof, had killed Abel, and was questioned, “Where
is thy brother?” he too made answer, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
Did I not pay my brother his wages, the thing he had merited from me?

O sumptuous Merchant-Prince, illustrious gamepreserving Duke, is there
no way of “killing” thy brother but Cain’s crude way! ...

One of Dr. Allison’s Scotch facts struck us much. A poor Irish Widow,
her husband having died in one of the Lanes of Edinburgh, went forth with
her children, bare of all resource, to solicit help from the Charitable
Establishments of that City. At this Charitable Establishment and then at
that she was refused; referred from one to the other, helped by none; --
till she had exhausted them all; till her strength and heart failed her：
she sank down in typhus-fever; died, and infected her Lane with fever, so
that “seventeen other persons” died of fever there in consequence. The
humane Physician asks there, upon, as with a heart too full for speaking,
Would it not have been economy to help this poor Widow?
