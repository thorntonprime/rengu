Whosoever would attain to the summit of his noble nature and to the vision
of the sovran good, which is God himself, must have profoundest knowledge of
himself and of things above himself. Thus he reaches the supreme. Beloved,
learn to know thyself, it shall profit thee more than any craft of creatures.
