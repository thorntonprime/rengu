Everybody is talkin’ these days about Tammany man growin’ rich on
graft, but nobody thinks of drawin’ the distinction between honest graft
and dishonest graft. There’s all the difference in the world between the
two. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself. I’ve
made a big fortune out of the game, and I’m gettin’ richer every day,
but I’ve not gone in for dishonest graft -- black-mailin’ gamblers,
saloon-keepers, disorderly people, etc. -- and neither has any of the men
who have made big fortunes in politics.

There’s an honest graft, and I’m an example of how it works. I might
sum up the whole thing by sayin’： “I seen my opportunities and I
took ’em.”

Just let me explain by examples. My party’s in power in the city, and
it’s goin’ to undertake a lot of public improvements. Well, I’m tipped
off, say, that they’re going to lay out a new park at a certain place.

I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all
the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that makes
its plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody cared
particular for before.

Ain’t it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on my
investment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that’s honest graft. ...

Now, in conclusion, I want to say that I don’t own a dishonest dollar. If
my worst enemy was given the job of writin’ my epitaph when I’m gone,
he couldn’t do more than write：

“George W. Plunkitt. He Seen His Opportunities, and He Took ’Em.”
