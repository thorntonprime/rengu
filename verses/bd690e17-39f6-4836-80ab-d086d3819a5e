That great god Sleep： I yield to him all greediness for time. What
does he care about Time! Ten hours, eleven twelve -- if he wants to
consume them in his silencing and privileged way, let him. Alas, I
seldom manage to retire early; evening is my time to read. Seductive
books, aided by the improbably intensifying noises of the old house,
usually keep me awake till past midnight. The personal errands of a
mouse in the thick walls of some yet-to-be-cleared inner room deepen
the mystery of the endless surrounding night.
