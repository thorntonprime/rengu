I prayed to the Divine Mother only for love. I offered flowers at Her
Lotus Feet and said with folded hands： ‘O Mother, here is Thy
ignorance and here is Thy knowledge; take them both and give me only
pure love for Thee. Here is Thy holiness and here is Thy unholiness;
take them both and give me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy virtue
and here is Thy sin; here is Thy good and here is Thy evil; take
them all and give me only pure love for Thee.  Here is Thy dharma and
here is Thy adharma; take them both and give me only pure love for
Thee.’
