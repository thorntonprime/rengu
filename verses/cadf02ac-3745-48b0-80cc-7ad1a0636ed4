When Yao ruled the world, Po-ch'eng Tzu-kao was enfeoffed as one of his
noblemen. But when Yao passed the throne to Shun, and Shun passed it to
Yu, Po-ch'eng Tzu-kao relinquished his title and took up farming. Yu
went to see him and found him working in the fields. Yu scurried
forward in the humblest manner, came to a halt, and said, "In former
times when Yao ruled the world, Sir, you served as one of his noblemen.
But when Yao passed the throne to Shun, and Shun passed it to me, you
relinquished your title and took up farming. May I be so bold as to ask
why?"
