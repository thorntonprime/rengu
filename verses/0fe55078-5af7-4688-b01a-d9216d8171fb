All flesh that is derived from the earth, must be decomposed and again
reduced to earthï¼š then the earthy salt produces a new generation by
celestial resuscitation. For where there was not first earth, there
can be no resurrection in our Magistery.  For in earth is the balm of
Nature, and the salt of the Sages.
