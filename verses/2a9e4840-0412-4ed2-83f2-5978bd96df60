Such as have borne rule in their dominions, men of great power, and endued with
their wisdom, shewing forth in the prophets the dignity of prophets.

And ruling over the present people, and by the strength of wisdom instructing
the people in most holy words;

Such as by their skill sought out musical tunes, and published canticles of the
scriptures;

Rich men in virtue, studying beautifulness, living at peace in their houses.

All these have gained glory in their generations, and were praised in their
days.
