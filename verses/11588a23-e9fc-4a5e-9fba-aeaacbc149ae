According to what has been said, we can encompass all the vast world-systems,
though numberless as grains of sand, with our One Mind. Then, why talk
of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’?  Honey having the invariable characteristic
of sweetness, it follows that all honey is sweet. To speak of this honey
as sweet and that honey as bitter would be nonsensical! How c o u l d it be
so? Hence we say that the Void has no inside and outside. There is only the
spontaneously existing Bhûtatathatâ (Absolute). And, for this same reason, we
say it has no centre. There is only the spontaneously existing Bhûtatathatâ.
