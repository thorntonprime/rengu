What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, 'By chanting "Om
Krishna, Om Râma”, one gets the result of a million sandhyâs'. Once he
said to me secretly, ‘I don't like the sandhyâ and other devotions any
more; but don’t tell anyone.’

Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She Herself
has become everything.
