Title: Parting Creates Beauty
---
Parting creates beauty.
The beauty of parting is not in the fragile gold of morning,
in the seamless silk of night,
in deathless immortality,
or the undying blue of heaven.
My love, without parting I wouldn't live again in laughter
  after dying in tears.

Ah, parting.
Beauty creates parting.
