This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.

Without natural affection, trucebreakers. false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good.

Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
God;

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereofï¼š ...

Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
