Just as a little drop of water mixed with a lot of wine seems entirely to lose
its own identity, while it takes on the taste of wine and its color; just as
iron, heated and glowing, looks very much like fire, having divested itself of
its original and characteristic appearance; and just as air flooded with the
light of the sun is transformed into the same splendor of light so that it
appears not so much lighted up as to be light itself; so it will inevitably
happen that in saints every human affection will then in some inneffable
manner melt away from self and be entirely transfused into the will of God.
