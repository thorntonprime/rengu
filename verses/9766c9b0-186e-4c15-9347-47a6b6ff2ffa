When he (Sulphur) is set free, he binds his gaolers, and gives their three
kingdoms to his deliverer. He also gives to him a magic mirror, in which
the three parts of the wisdom of the whole world may be seen and known at
a glance; and this mirror clearly exhibits the creation of the world, the
influences of the celestial virtues on earthly things, and the way in which
Nature composes substances by the regulation of heat. With its aid, men may at
once understand the motion of the Sun and Moon, and that universal movement
by which Nature herself is governed -- also the various degrees of heat,
cold, moisture, and dryness, and the virtues of herbs and of all other things.
