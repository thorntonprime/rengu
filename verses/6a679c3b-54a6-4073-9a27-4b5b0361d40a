---
The Abundance of God is like a mighty ocean, so vast you cannot possibly
exhaust it or cause a shortage for others. You can go to this inexhaustible
ocean with a small cup and bring away only that small cup of bounty and
blessing. Or, if you have faith enough, you can take a bucket and bring
away a bucketful. It makes no difference to the ocean. Nor does it matter
how often you go. ...abundance is always there.
