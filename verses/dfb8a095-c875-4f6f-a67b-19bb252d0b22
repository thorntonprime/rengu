Thee I choose, of all the world, alone;
Wilt thou suffer me to sit in grief?
My heart is as a pen in thy hand.
Thou art the cause if I am glad or melancholy.
Save what thou wiliest, what will have I?
Save what thou showest, what do I see? ...
When thou art hidden I am of the infidels;
When thou art manifest. I am of the faithful.
I have nothing, except thou hast bestowed it;
What dost thou seek from my bosom and sleeve?
