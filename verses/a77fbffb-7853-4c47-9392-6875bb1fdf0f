Title: Like a Fire
---
When I seek what I want
I find this little something
but know nothing of
    Your deep,
and You, my God,
see my ways and turn
from these to keep
    your distance,
for what You want
is my soul stripped of
everything, even true
    desire,
and You burn not
like a candle flickering
in the dark but like a
    fire
flaming the soul when
it seeks nothing but You
and finds everything
    in You.
