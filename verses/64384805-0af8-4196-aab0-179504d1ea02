Passion is overcome only by him who has won through stillness of spirit the
perfect vision. Knowing this, I must first seek for stillness; it comes
through the contentment that is regardless of the world. What creature of a
day should cling to other frail beings, when he can never again through
thousands of births behold his beloved?
