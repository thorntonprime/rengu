Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
We have already become one, so how can I say anything? But I have just
said that we are one, so how can I not be saying something? The one and
what I said about it make two, and two and the original one make three.
If we go on this way, then even the cleverest mathematician can't tell
where we'll end, much less an ordinary man. If by moving from nonbeing
to being we get to three, how far will we get if we move from being to
being? Better not to move, but to let things be!
