Title: Diamond Mountains
---
O, twelve thousand peaks --
Do you know where your love is and what he does?
Because of you, he’s destroying religion, philosophy, reputation, wealth --
Everything, in the burning flames of his heart.

Are you the red of flowers?
The green in leaves?
Are you the drunkenness of tinted maples?
The awakening in white snow?

I know your silence well.
I know your calm, bemused smile
  suppressed amid the unending praise of eager children.

Heaven or hell -- why can’t you be just one?
Like dreamless sleep, be pure and simple.
I’m not a madman trying to pick flowers across the river with a short hook
I too want peace and simplicity.
I kiss the slip of cloud borne by your breath.

O, twelve thousand peaks,
You don’t know where your love is and what he does.
