Title: The Descent of Love
---
In distress and want I ask, "Where, O God, are You?"
Here, I am as close to you as the warmth of your breath.

But this does not satisfy my mind, and so I ask again.
Here, in the confusions that make you trade life for death.

Still I ask what I have with my questions already said.
Here, in the doubts that rise against My descending truth.

And yet I am undone with deceptions ever old and new.
Here, let me give Myself to you with love that alone will soothe.
