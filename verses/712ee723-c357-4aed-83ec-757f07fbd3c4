(Krishnakishore) passed through a God-intoxicated state, when he would repeat
only the word ‘Om’ and shut himself up alone in his room. His relatives thought
he was actually mad, and called in a physician. Ram Kavirâj of Nâtâgore came to
see him. Krishnakishore said to the physician, ‘Cure me, sir, of my malady, if
you please, but not of my Om.’
