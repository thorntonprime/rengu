It is faith that steers us through stormy seas, faith that moves mountains
and faith that jumps across the oceans, That faith is nothing but a living,
wide-awake consciousness of god within, He who has achieved that faith
wants nothing, Bodily diseased, he is spiritually healthy, physically poor,
he rolls in spiritual riches.
