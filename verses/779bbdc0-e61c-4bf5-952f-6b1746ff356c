There is a divinity moving you, like that contained in the stone which
Euripides calls a magnet, but which is commonly known as the stone of
Heraclea. This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a
similar power of attracting other rings; and sometimes you may see a number
of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite
a long chain; and all of them derive their power of suspension from the
original stone. In like manner the Muse first of all inspires men herself;
and from these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended,
who take the inspiration.
