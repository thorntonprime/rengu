Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal

Chang Wu-tzu said, "Even the Yellow Emperor would be confused if he
heard such words, so how could you expect Confucius to understand them?
What's more, you're too hasty in your own appraisal. You see an egg and
demand a crowing cock, see a crossbow pellet and demand a roast dove.
I'm going to try speaking some reckless words and I want you to listen
to them recklessly. How will that be? The sage leans on the sun and
moon, tucks the universe under his arm, merges himself with things,
leaves the confusion and muddle as it is, and looks on slaves as
exalted. Ordinary men strain and struggle; the sage is stupid and
blockish. He takes part in ten thousand ages and achieves simplicity in
oneness. For him, all the ten thousand things are what they are, and
thus they enfold each other.
