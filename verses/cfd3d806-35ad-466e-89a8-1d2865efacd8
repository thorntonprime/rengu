So will (our Lord) stir other men in spirit to give us our needful
things that belong to this life, as meat and clothes and all these
other, if he see that we will not leave the work of his love for
business about them. And this I say in confusion of their error who
say that it is not lawful for men to set them to serve God in
contemplative life, except they be secure beforehand of their bodily
necessaries. For they say that God sendeth the cow, but not by the
horn. And truly they say wrong of God, as they well know. For trust
steadfastly, whatsoever thou be that truly turnest thee from the world
unto God, that one of these two shall God send thee, without business
of thine ownï¼š and that is, either abundance of necessaries, or else
strength in body and patience in spirit to bear need. What then
recketh it which a man have? for all come to one in true
contemplatives. And whoso is in doubt of this, either the devil of
hell is in his breast and reaveth him of belief, or else he is not yet
truly turned to God as he should be, be he never so clever, or show he
never so holy reasons to the contrary, whatsoever he be.
