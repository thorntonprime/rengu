Title: Two Kings and No-Form
Format: verse
---
The South Sea King was Act-on-Your-Hunch.
The North Sea King was Act-in-a-Flash.
The King of the place between them was
No-Form.

Now South Sea King
And North Sea King
Used to go together often
To the land of No-Fonn：
He treated them well.

So they consulted together
They thought up a good turn,
A pleasant surprise, for No-Form
In token of appreciation.

"Men," they said, "have seven openings
For seeing, hearing, eating, breathing,
And so on. But No-Fonn
Has no openings. Let's make him
A few holes."
So after that
They put holes in No-Fonn,
One a day, for seven days.
And when they finished the seventh opening,
Their friend lay dead.

Lao Tan said： "To organize is to destroy."
