Where there is no Truth, there can be no true knowledge. That is why the word
Chit or knowledge is associated with the name of God. And where there is true
knowledge, there is always bliss (Ananda). Sorrow has no place there. And
even as Truth is eternal, so is bliss derived from it. Hence we know God
as Sat-chit-ananda, one who combines in Himself Truth, Knowledge and Bliss.
