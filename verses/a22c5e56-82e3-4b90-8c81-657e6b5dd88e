Satan, that grim pseudo-alchymist, ever lies in wait to draw those
whom Christ has regenerated, and made sons of God by faith through

good conscience, away from the right path -- and in this attempt he
and his faithful servants, our sinful flesh, and the wicked, seductive
world, are, alas, very frequently successful.
