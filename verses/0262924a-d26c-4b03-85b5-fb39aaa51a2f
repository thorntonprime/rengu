  - Sacrifice-Death=Volition, Obedience and Conformity=Obedience
  - Sacrifice-Death=Separation-Sin
By: St Gregory of Sinai
---
Disobedience is the mouth of hell; argumentativeness is its tongue,
whetted like a sword; self-gratification is its sharp teeth;
self-justification its throat; high opinion of oneself, which casts
one into hell, is the belching of its all-devouring belly. But he who,
through obedience, conquers the first, by one stroke cuts off all the
rest and with one stride reaches heaven.
