Title: Xiyuanâ€™s Pair of Wrongs
---
A test is raised for examination/(to) examine it

Venerable Tianping (Heavenly-peace) at the time of
traveling on foot called on Xiyuan (Western-courtyard). always
said, Do not say seek a single
person to raise a saying, and still there is none.

One day Xiyuan, seeing in the distance, called and
said, Zongyi (Tianpings personal name).

Ping raised his head

Xiyuan said, Wrong. (mistake, blunder, fault)

Ping walked three pairs of steps.

Xiyuan again said, Wrong.

Ping neared in front.

Xiyuan said, It is fitting to come to this pair of
wrongs, but are they Xiyuans (i.e., my) wrongs or are they
Upper-seats (i.e., your) wrongs?

Ping said, Zongyis (i.e., my) wrongs.

Xiyuan said, Wrong.

Ping gave up to go.

Xiyuan said, Just for the time being Upper-seat, pass
the summer on this other side and stay together to discuss and
deliberate this pair of wrongs.

Ping undertook at that time then to walk .

Afterwards in residence at a Courtyard (i.e.,
a temple) spoke to the multitude and said, When I initially
undertook the time of traveling on foot, because of the working of the
wind, I arrived at senior elder Simings place, and in succession
let down a pair of wrongs. Furthermore, to detain me to
pass the summer to stay together with me to discuss and deliberate
started on foot toward the direction of the South, I knew beforehand to
say Wrong entirely (alt. in the end)!

Ripples/Yi.
