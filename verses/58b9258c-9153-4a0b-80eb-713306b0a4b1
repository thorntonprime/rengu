Title: It Tried to Prepare Me
---
The clear night sky tried to prepare me for what it knew would someday
happen;

it began to show me ever deeper aspects of its splendor, and then one
evening just directly asked, Will you be able to withstand your own
magnificence?

I thought I was just hearing things, until a spring orchard I was
passing my days with

at the height of its glory burst into song, about our -- every
human's -- destiny to burn with radiance.

Still I felt my ears were playing tricks on me until the morning came
when God tore apart my chest ... needing more room to bloom inside.

I began to roll through the streets in ecstasy. Everyone thought I was
crazy.

I hope everyone someday knows how blessed I was. You will.
