Title: Looking at the Moon
---
The moon was bright and I yearned for you so.
Smoothing my bedclothes, I went in the garden and gazed awhile
 at the moon.

Slowly, it became your face;
I could clearly see your broad brow, round nose, and fine mustache.
A year ago, I thought your face was like the moon;
Tonight the moon has become your face.

Since your face is the moon, so is mine.
But do you know that my face has become the waning moon?
Since your face is the moon, so is mine.
