Ash Wednesday： the ashes themselves bring the mercy of the blessing of
Christ, in sobriety and barefooted peace.

At St. Anne’s the sun is as bright as the first day that it was created.
The world is clean. There is sin in it, but Christ has overcome the world. Even
on Ash Wednesday I begin to hear the silence of Easter.

Many birds, going north, were flying in the wind. They moved slowly against
the blue sky and looked like a school of fish in clear West Indian waters. The
sun shone through their wings and made them seem like red and orange fins.

I think of the unity of the Church in this her Lent (the lesson from the book
of Joel brings this out- “Blow the trumpet and call the people together
for the great fast!" Joel 1：14). The whole Church is called together and
we realize that our Lent is united with the suffering of the martyrs and
the fasts of the desert fathers and the good works and penances of all the
saints. Whatever I can give to God and to other men is only the effect and
manifestation in me of the power of the Passion of Jesus. I would reply to His
action, and let Him show Himself in my life. This He will do in a way I have
expected and not expected; planned and not planned; desired and not desired.

My decisions do not anticipate His coming： they manifest that He has come,
if they be His decisions.
