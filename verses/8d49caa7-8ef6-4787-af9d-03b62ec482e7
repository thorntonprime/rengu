Lo! the God-fearing are among gardens and watersprings.
‘Enter them in peace, secure.’
And We remove whatever burning venom may be in their breasts. As brethren,
  face to face, they rest on couches raised.
Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence.
Announce unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful.
