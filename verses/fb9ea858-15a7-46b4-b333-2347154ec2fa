Full many a lady
I have ey'd with best regard, and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear： for several virtues
Have I lik’d several women; never any
With so full soul but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow’d.
And put it to the foil： but you, O you!
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature’s best.
