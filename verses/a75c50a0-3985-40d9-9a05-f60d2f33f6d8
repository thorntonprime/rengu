Title: Everyone Should Be Honored Like This
---
When people come to my house for the first time, if they do not lean toward
 being too proud,
I will kneel before them and ask for their hand, and place the back of it
 against my forehead.
Everyone should be honored like this. What else can make you grow to your
 full height?
I am one of Godâ€™s pillars in this world, and a proxy too, always carrying
 out His wish.
And what of those for whom it would be best if they not see me ... humbly
 before them-on my knees, until they are ready?
Well, at night in my prayers, I place my head upon their feet. I plant,
 and help awaken, a sacred realm in all who have entered my mind.
