It is much to be wished that the eyes of our self-opinionated doctors were
opened, or the nebulous film, or sophistical mask, which obscures their vision,
taken away, that so they might see more clearly. I am particularly alluding to
the Aristotelians, and other blind theological quibblers, who spend their lives
in wrangling and disputing about Divine things in a most unchristian manner,
and put forth no end of manifold distinctions, divisions, and confusions, thus
obscuring the Scriptural doctrine concerning the union of natures and
communication of substances in Christ. If they will not believe God and His
Holy Word, they might at least be enlightened by a study of our chemical Art,
and of the union of two waters (viz., that of mercury and that of the Sun)
which our Art so strikingly and palpably exhibits.
