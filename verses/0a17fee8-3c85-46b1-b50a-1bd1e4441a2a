Title: Faithful to the Truth
---
In concluding this retreatï¼š

1. There can be no doubt, no compromise, in my decision to be completely
faithful to God's will and truth, and hence I must seek always and in
everything to act for His will and in His truth, and this to seek with His
grace to be "a saint."

2. There must be no doubt, no compromise in my efforts to avoid falsifying
this work of truth by considering too much what others approve of and regard
as "holy." In a word, it may happen (or may not) that what God demands of
me may make me look less perfect to others, and that it may rob me of their
support, their affection, their respect. To become a saint therefore may
mean the anguish of looking like, and in a real sense "being," a sinner,
an outcast. It may mean apparent conflict with certain standards that may
be wrongly understood by me or by others or by all of us.

3. The thing is to cling to God's will and truth in their purity and try to
be sincere and to act in all things out of genuine love, in so far as I can.
