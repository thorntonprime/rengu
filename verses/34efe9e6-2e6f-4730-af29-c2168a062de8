  - Discernment-Truth=The Void=The Plenitude of the Void
  - 220
By: Ananda Moyi
Commentary: \'These are the two methods of Jnâna-Yoga： that of negation
  (neti, neti). via negationis. and that of affirmation (iti, iti). via
  eminentiae. both of which lead to the realization of the identity between
  àtman and Brahman' (note by the editor). The former method relates to the
  viewpoint of Extinction (Part V in this book), the latter to Identity
  (Part VI).

The soul can only be pure and white like snow if you make a void in yourself,
or on the contrary if you lose yourself in the totality of creation. All
colours merge to produce white, which is the colour of the Formless.
