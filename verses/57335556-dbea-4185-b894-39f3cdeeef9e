Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher

Master Lai said, "A child, obeying his father and mother, goes wherever
he is told, east or west, south or north. And the yin and yang - how
much more are they to a man than father or mother! Now that they have
brought me to the verge of death, if I should refuse to obey them, how
perverse I would be! What fault is it of theirs? The Great Clod burdens
me with form, labors me with life, eases me in old age, and rests me in
death. So if I think well of my life, for the same reason I must think
well of my death. When a skilled smith is casting metal, if the metal
should leap up and say, `I insist upon being made into a Mo-yeh!'  he
would surely regard it as very inauspicious metal indeed. Now, having
had the audacity to take on human form once, if I should say, `I don't
want to be anything but a man! Nothing but a man!', the Creator would
surely regard me as a most inauspicious sort of person. So now I think
of heaven and earth as a great furnace, and the Creator as a skilled
smith. Where could he send me that would not be all right? I will go
off to sleep peacefully, and then with a start I will wake up."
