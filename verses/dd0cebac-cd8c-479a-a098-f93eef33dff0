Walk honestly, saith St Paul, Rom. 13.13. The Word is KaXuis, Beautifully.
Write after the Copy of Divine Beauty, which dwells in the midst of thee, and
shines forth from the Face of the Lord Jesus in thine Heart： Imitate, discover
this in all thy Conversation.

The chief Things of Beauty, are Light and Proportion. Thy Christ in thee is
both these： the Light, and the Wisdom of God. Then thou livest Beautifully,
when this Light runs along thro’ thy Thoughts, Affections, Actions, shining in
all, and making every thing proportion -- able to itself.
