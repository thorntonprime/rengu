So likewise must we simply commit ourselves to God with perfect trust
in His eternal purpose; for when He pleases that it shall be
accomplished to our waiting souls, then, no doubt. He will come to us,
and be born in us. But when? Leave that to Him; to some He comes in
their youth; to others in old age; to some in death; this leave to His
Divine will, and do not take upon thyself to adopt any singular
exercises, but keep the Commandments.  and believe the articles of the
Christian faith.
