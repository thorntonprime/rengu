What a waste of time and energy it is to strive to obtain material objects
of desire. No lasting satisfaction can result from acquiring them since by
their very acquisition they have ceased to be objects of desire. They are
consumed like firewood and “burnt offerings”. We spit out the ashes in our
mouths and search for another tree to cut down.

The saints strove for spiritual insights. They questioned the meaning of
life. Achieving this insight, they gained the universe. There being nothing
else left to desire, they lit no sacrificial fires.
