Title: My Dream
---
When you stroll in the tree shade in the fresh of dawn,
my dream becomes a small star keeping watch above you.

When you nap on a summerâ€™s day flushed with heat,
my dream becomes a refreshing breeze swirling around you.

When you sit in solitude reading on a quiet autumn night,
my dream becomes a cricket chirping under your desk.
