Solitary and transcendent,
Round and fullï¼š
Where the power of the eye ends, it towers high.
The moon descends, the pond is empty, the color of night is deep.
When the clouds recede, the mountain is lean, the faces of autumn many.
The positions of the eight trigrams right,
The energies of the five elements harmonize.
The body is in there before -- have you seen it?
