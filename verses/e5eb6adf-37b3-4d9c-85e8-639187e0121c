The Zen master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one
living a pure life.

A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived
near him. Suddenly, without any warning, her parents discovered
she was with child.

This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man
was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.

In great anger the parent went to the master. "Is that so?" was
all he would say.

After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time
he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he
took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his
neighbors and everything else he needed.

A year later the girl-mother could stand it no longer. She told
her parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young
man who worked in the fish market.

The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask
forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.

Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child, all he said wasï¼š "Is
that so?"
