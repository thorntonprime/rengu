Title: The Salmon Run
---
I wonder how God ever gets any work done when He could just be gazing
at Himself in awe all day?  What discipline He shows.

I am talking about a real problem that will challenge you someday,
though you may know nothing about that yetï¼š

splendor taking over the place and rising from your body like a
sunrise -- gods sitting on a hill needing to bask in you. For it is
true, we help sustain existence.

All types of fishermen, merchants and seekers will gather around you
when you reach your goal.

They will be wanting to cast their nets into the brilliant salmon run
you become,

leaping into the sky, offering to take any near along.
