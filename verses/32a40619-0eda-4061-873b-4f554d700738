Title: Your Single Yes of Love
---
Often little things annoy me
    and the big ones seem to gallop
with their shades of gloom
    and shake off even the radiant

sun-splashed light of today,
    and I know I should hoe the
virtue of patience but do not,
    and all my hurry unravels

my careful plans for calm
    and worries away thoughts
of long-off better times.
    And then I hear You say again

that You are without why
    and ask that I let go of
all this in the simple joy
    of Your single Yes of Love.
