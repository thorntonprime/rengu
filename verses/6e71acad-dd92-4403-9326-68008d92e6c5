Title: Offering Christ Our Sorry World
---
The center of all spiritual life is Christ in His Mass, Christ our Pasch who
is slain and “dies now no more” but “draws all things to Himself,”
that we who are baptized in His death, crucifying our flesh and its desires,
may live His life with a life hidden in Christ in God.And the heart of all
life is not merely the static presence of the Blessed Sacrament, although
Christ is truly living in our tabernacles, but above all in the action of
the Mass, which is the center of all contemplation, an action in which the
Christian family is gathered around Christ and in which Christ in His Body
glorifies His Father. A sacrament of living unity in which the Love Who
is God unites men to God and men to one another in Christ.When the Mass
recovers its meaning, then devotion to the Blessed Sacrament reserved in
the Tabernacle acquires its own true meaning and begins to live. Then the
whole interior life is unified and vitalized and every department of it
flows with life. In fact, “departments” and “sections” of one’s
life cease to exist in isolation and everything functions together.

I go to the altar offering Christ a sorry world to give to His Father in
Thanksgiving, a world transformed into His own human life by our union
with Him and His union with us in His Sacrifice and our Sacrifice which
is His Pasch.

O God, give peace to your world. Give strength to the hearts of men. Raise
us up from death in Christ. Give us to eat of His immortality and His
glory. Give us to drink of the wine of His Kingdom.
