There is a producer which has not been produced, a transformer which is not
transformed. This non-produced has produced all beings, this non-transformed
transforms all beings. ... The producer is the yin-yang; the transformer is the
cycle of the four seasons. The producer is immobile, the transformer goes and
comes.
