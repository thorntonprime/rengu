For it is impossible for language, miracles, or apparitions to teach us the
infallibility of God's word, or to shew us the certainty of true religion,
without a clear sight into truth itself, that is into the truth of things.
Which will themselves when truly seen, by the very beauty and glory of them,
best discover, and prove religion.
