All the wrong and the reproach that is brought on God by sin he gladly bears
and has borne many a year in order that mortals might arrive at a lively
understanding of his love and the more to rouse their love and gratitude and
fan the flame of their devotion—the normal and proper reaction from their sin.
For this reason God is willing to bear the brunt of sins and often winks at
them, mostly sending them to people for whom he has provided some high
destiny.
