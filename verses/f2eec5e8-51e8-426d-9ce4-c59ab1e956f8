Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
Master Kuang Ch'eng said, "Come, I will explain to you. This Thing I
have been talking about is inexhaustible, and yet men all suppose that
it has an end. This Thing I have been talking about is unfathomable,
and yet men all suppose that it has a limit. He who attains my Way will
be a Bright One on high, and a king in the world below. But he who
fails to attain my Way, though he may see the light above him, will
remain below as dust. All the hundred creatures that flourish are born
out of dust and return to dust. So I will take leave of you, to enter
the gate of the inexhaustible and wander in the limitless fields, to
form a triad with the light of the sun and moon, to partake in the
constancy of Heaven and earth. What stands before me I mingle with,
what is far from me I leave in darkness. All other men may die; I
alone will survive!"
