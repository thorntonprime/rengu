Title: Abracadabra-Doo
---
A mantra I heard about seemed to work for an eccentric uncle I had whenever he
 needed a boost.
That mantra went ... Abracadabra-doo. And sometimes he would say
 Abracadabra-boo!
Personally, I think it was that boo that somehow pulled it all together and
 gave it any needed final punch
to chase any unwanted devious spirits away who may have been siphoning off
 vital juices.
Just for the record thoughï¼š I really don't believe in magic lamps, genies and
 things like that,
and any three wishes you might ever really want, someone like me could deliver
 if you honed your charms enough.
But what the hell, maybe say it a couple of times a year with gusto ...
 Abracadabra-boo, or Abracadabradoo!
Consider singing both in some kind of unison, you might as well with all the
 other wacky things you have tried.
