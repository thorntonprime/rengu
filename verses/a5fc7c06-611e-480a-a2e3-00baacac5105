Title: The Most Alive Moment
Description: May 4
---
The most alive moment comes
when those who love each other
meet each other's eyes
and in what flows between them then.

To see your face in a crowd of others,
or alone on a frightening street,
I weep for that.

Our tears improve the earth.
The time you scolded me,
your gratitude, your laughing,
always your qualities increase the soul.

Seeing you is a wine
that does not muddle or numb.

We sit inside the cypress shadow
where amazement and clear thought
twine their slow growth into us.
