Title: When the Meadows on the Body Turn Gray
Description: July 4
---
When the meadows on the body begin to turn gray, let your eye soften toward
 yourself, and those who are close.

Let anyone, anything, inside who has driven you, let them retire or move at an
 easier pace.

And where you were once firm, and might have even said to someone, feel my
 muscle, or admired it yourself,

yes, now look at the way you have become, or will someday if you live as long
 as you may want.

Many do all they can to not have to face the candle going out.

The wonder of my body aging, dying, is finding another flame within, a holy
 eternal

sphere, that will never go out and is more beautiful than all the form you have
 known -- put together.

When the fields on the body begin to turn gray let your handâ€™s touch upon all,
 soften.
