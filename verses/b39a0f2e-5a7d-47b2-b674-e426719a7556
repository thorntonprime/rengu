In this illumination I heard the ringing of bells. My frame dissolved and my
trace vanished and my name was rased out. By reason of the violence of what
I experienced I became like a worn-out garment which hangs on a high tree,
and the fierce blast carries it away piece by piece. I beheld naught but
lightnings and thunders, and clouds raining lights, and seas surging with
fire. ‘The heavens and the earth crowded upon one another’, and I found
myself in ‘darkness upon darkness’. The All-Powerful kept eradicating
my faculties one after the other, and transfixing one desire after another,
until I was thunderstruck by the Divine Majesty, and the supreme Beauty
spouted forth from the needle’s eye of the imagination; then the right
Hand in the supreme aspect was extended for grasping. Things at once came
into existence; obscurity departed, and after the Ark had settled on Mount
Jûdî, there was heard the cry： ‘O heaven and earth, come both of you,
willingly or loth! They said： We come, obedient’ (Qur’ân, XLI 11).
