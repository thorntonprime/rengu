Title: Last Night, as I Was Sleeping
---
Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- blessed vision! --
that a fountain flowed
here in my heart.
I said： Why, O water, have you come
along this secret waterway,
spring of new life, 
which I have never tasted?

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- blessed vision! --
that I had a beehive
here in my heart;
and the golden bees
were making
from all my old sorrows
white wax and sweet honey.

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- blessed vision! --
a blazing sun shone
here in my heart.
It was blazing because it gave heat
from a red home,
and it was sun because it gave light
and because it made me weep.

Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt -- blessed vision! --
that it was God I had
here in my heart.
