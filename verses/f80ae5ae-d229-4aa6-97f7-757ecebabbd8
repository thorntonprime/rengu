Title: When Everything Is Wet
---
Nothing can spoil this morning, The rain has stopped, The birds sing and
starlings pursue a crow across the grey sky, Clouds still hang low over
the woods, It’s cool.

The whiskey barrels by the woodshed stand or lie in wetness, one of them
with wet weeds up the navel, others rolling in the soaked chips of wood
and bark.

Someone has sawed a keg in half, and it is one of the most beautiful objects
on the property at the moment, An example of wabi-sabi (simplicity) that
Suzuki talks about, With joy, yesterday, I smelled the charred barrel,
How beautiful to see it catch rain.

Yesterday I was bitter for a while, growling to myself. “Yes, we have
the Holy Ghost all right -- in a cage with His wings clipped.” But later,
during the Gospel, the “Let not your heart be disturbed” came through
into my heart as if especially directed to me and I remembered there was
no need to be bitter or to worry, or even to notice what appears to me
to be senseless in our life here.

I do not have to react, It is useless, There are much better things to do,
And to react is to become implicated -- to become a prisoner of the same
nonsense that I am compelled to condemn, Do not be compelled.

Here comes a small, shining rabbit, A kingbird gurgles and chortles in
the cedars, Everything is wet.
