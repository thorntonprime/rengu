Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who, though he has committed no offence,
 endures reproach, stripes, and bonds, who has endurance for his force,
 and strength for his army.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who is free from anger, dutiful, virtuous,
 without appetites, who is subdued, and has received his last body.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who does not cling to sensual pleasures,
 like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who, even here, knows the end of his own
 suffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled. ...
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who fosters no desires for this world or for
 the next, has no inclinations, and is unshackled.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who has no interests, and when he has understood
 (the truth), does not say How, how? and who has reached the depth of the
 Immortal.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who in this world has risen above both ties,
 good and evil, who is free from grief, from sin, and from impurity.
Him I call indeed a Brâhmana who is bright like the moon, pure, serene,
 undisturbed, and in whom all gayety is extinct.
