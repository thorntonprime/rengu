---
But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee. --
See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite
time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the
changeableness and want of judgment in those who pretend to give praise,
and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be
quiet at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it
is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people
are they who will praise.
