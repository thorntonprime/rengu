Title: Magic
---
You snatched away my joy like the autumn floods
  that sweep away the leaves piled in the small stream.
Now all I have is the pain.
But I can’t bring myself to hate you
  because you eased me before you left.
If you robbed me of joy and path at the same time,
I would have no heart at all.

I’m a star in the sky that hides its face in a veil of clouds.
I’m a pearl in the sea that becomes a button on your shoe.
If you take the star and pearl as your lovers, accept them with joy.
But if your heart is also troubled, let it be your pain.
But don’t teach me the magic of snatching away hearts;
and then this separation won’t be the end of love.
