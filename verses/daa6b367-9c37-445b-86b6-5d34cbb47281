Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
\"The beautiful Hsi-shih, troubled with heartburn, frowned at her
neighbors. An ugly woman of the neighborhood, seeing that Hsi-shih was
beautiful, went home and likewise pounded her breast and frowned at her
neighbors. But at the sight of her the rich men of the neighborhood
shut tight their gates and would not venture out, while the poor men
grabbed their wives and children by the hand and scampered off. The
woman understood that someone frowning could be beautiful, but she did
not understand where the beauty of the frown came from. A pity, indeed!
Your master is going to end up in trouble!"
