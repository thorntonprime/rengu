For the soul to be naked she must turn away from all the images and forms
spread out before her and stop at none of them. For the divine nature is no
form nor semblance that she can understand. Being turned away from these
towards what transcends them -- divorced, that is, from images and forms --
the soul receives the likeness of the formless nature of God whose real
form has never been revealed to any creature. This is the secret door into
the divine nature, which the soul has in the image. ... Even God himself is
forbidden there so far as he is subject to condition. ... There the spirit
loses its uses not its essence. ... These are the blessed dead that are dead in
God. No one can be buried and beatified in the Godhead who has not died to God.
