\"As for me, I've been trying a long time to be of no use, and though I
almost died, I've finally got it. This is of great use to me. If I had
been of some use, would I ever have grown this large? Moreover you and
I are both of us things. What's the point of this - things condemning
things? You, a worthless man about to die-how do you know I'm a
worthless tree?"
