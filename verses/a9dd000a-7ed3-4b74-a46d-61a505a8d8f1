Set foot on Han Shan's Way?
Han Shan's road is endless ...
The gorge is long. Rocks, and rocks and rocks,
 jut up.
The torrent's wide, reeds almost hide the far side.
The moss is slippery even without rain.
The pines singï¼š the wind is real enough.
Who's ready to leap free of the world's traces
to come to sit with me among white clouds?
