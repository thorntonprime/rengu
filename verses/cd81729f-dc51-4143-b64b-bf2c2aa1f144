  - Combat-Action=Symbolism=The Worship of Images
By: William Durandus
---
Pictures and ornaments in churches are the lessons and the scriptures
of the laity. Introd. Whence Gregory： It is one thing to adore a
picture, and another by means of a picture historically to learn what
should be adored. ... We worship not images, nor account them to be
gods, nor put any hope of salvation in them： for that were idolatry.
Yet we adore them for the memory and remembrance of things done long
agone.
