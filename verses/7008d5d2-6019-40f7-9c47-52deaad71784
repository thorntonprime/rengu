The demonic people know not how to follow right or how to refrain from
wrong： there is neither purity, nor good conduct, nor truth in them.

They say that ‘this universe is without truth, without a basis,
without God. born of mutual union caused by lust. What else is there?’

Holding this view, these ruined souls, of small understanding and of
fierce deeds, rise as the enemies of the world for its destruction.

Filled with insatiable desires, possessed with hypocrisy, pride and
arrogance, holding evil fancies through delusion, they work with
unholy resolve;

Beset with immense cares, ending only in death; regarding sensual
enjoyment as the highest and feeling sure that that is all there is;

Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they
strive to secure hoards of wealth by unjust means, for sensual
gratification. ...

Bewildered by many fancies, enwrapped in the net of delusion, addicted
to the gratification of the senses, they fall into a foul hell.
