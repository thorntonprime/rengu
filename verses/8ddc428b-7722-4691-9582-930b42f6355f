The man of enlightened mind who is active in the world and the illumined sage
who sits in his hermitage, are both alike in their spiritual calm, and have
undoubtedly reached the state of blessedness.

It is the activity or the inactivity of the mind which is the sole cause of
the restlessness or tranquillity of men. Thickly-gathering desires serve to
fill the mind with the vanity of their nature, which is the cause of all its
woesï¼š therefore try to weaken your worldly senses at all times. ...

The homes of householders who have well-governed minds and have banished
their sense of egoism are as good as solitary forests, cool caves or peaceful
woods. O Rama-ji.

Men of pacified mind view the bright and beautiful buildings of cities in the
same dispassionate light as they behold the trees of a forest. He who. in his
inmost Spirit, sees the world in God. is verily the Lord of mankind!
