When the springs dry up and the fish are left stranded on the ground,
they spew each other with moisture and wet each other down with spit -
but it would be much better if they could forget each other in the
rivers and lakes. Instead of praising Yao and condemning Chieh, it
would be better to forget both of them and transform yourself with the
Way.
