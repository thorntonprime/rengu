When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with
 death?
Were the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put
 to death those who innovate, then who would dare?
There is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.
To kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood
 on behalf of the master carpenter.
In chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who
 escape hurting their own hands instead.
