\"He whose understanding cannot grasp these minute and subtle words, but
is only fit to win some temporary gain - is he not like the frog in the
caved-in well? Chuang Tzu, now - at this very moment he is treading the
Yellow Springs or leaping up to the vast blue. To him there is no
north or south - in utter freedom he dissolves himself in the four
directions and drowns himself in the unfathomable. To him there is no
east or west - he begins in the Dark Obscurity and returns to the Great
Thoroughfare. Now you come niggling along and try to spy him out or fix
some name to him, but this is like using a tube to scan the sky or an
awl to measure the depth of the earth - the instrument is too small, is
it not? You'd better be on your way! Or perhaps you've never heard
about the young boy of Shou-ling who went to learn the Han-tan Walk. He
hadn't mastered what the Han-tan people had to teach him when he forgot
his old way of walking, so that he had to crawl all the way back home.
Now if you don't get on your way, you're likely to forget what you knew
before and be out of a job!"
