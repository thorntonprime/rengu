When the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara
was coursing in the deep prajña paramita,
he perceived that all five skandhas are empty
thus he overcame all ills and suffering
oh, Shariputra, Form Does not Differ From the Void,
And the Void Does Not Differ From Form.
Form is Void and Void is Form;
the same is True For Feelings,
Perceptions, Volitions, and Consciousness.
Shariputra, the Characteristics of the
void-ness of All Dharmas
are non-arising, non-ceasing, non-defiled,
non-pure, non-increasing, non-decreasing.
Therefore, in the void there are no forms,
no feelings, perceptions, volitions or consciousness.
no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind;
no form, sound, smell, taste, touch or mind object;
no realm of the eye,
until we come to no realm of consciousness.
No ignorance and also no ending of ignorance,
until we come to no old age and death and
no ending of old age and death.
Also, there is no truth of suffering,
of the cause of suffering,
of the cessation of suffering, nor of the path.
There is no wisdom, and there is no attainment whatsoever.
because there is nothing to be attained,
the bodhisattva relying on prajña paramita has
no obstruction in his mind.
Because there is no obstruction, he has no fear,
and he passes far beyond confused imagination.
And reaches ultimate nirvana.
The Buddhas of the Past, Present and Future,
by relying on prajña paramita
have attained supreme enlightenment.
Therefore, the prajña paramita is the great magic spell,
the spell of illumination, the supreme spell,
which can truly protect one from all suffering without fail.
Therefore he uttered the spell of prajña paramita,
saying, gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi svaha.
