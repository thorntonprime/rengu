Man often becomes what be believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to
myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end
by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the
belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even
it I may not have it at the beginning.
