Title: Satisfaction
---
Is there satisfaction in the world?
Is there satisfaction in life?
If so, there must be some for me.

There may be satisfaction in the world, but it’s one step ahead.
Its distance exceeds my reach, its speed matches my stride.
It can’t be caught, it can’t be thrown away.

Attaining satisfaction is dissatisfaction; it’s always one step ahead.
Satisfaction is for the fool and the saint, or it’s the expectation
 of the weak.
Satisfaction flows abreast with life.
I’d rather turn around and stamp out its traces.

I’ve attained satisfaction.
When shimmering dreams and goldspun illusions
 enveloped you in your flower garden,
I attained it.
