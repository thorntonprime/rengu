Just before Ninakawa passed away the Zen master Ikkyu visited
him. "Shall I lead you on?" Ikkyu asked.

Ninakawa replied： "I came here alone and I go alone. What help
could you be to me?"

Ikkyu answered： "If you think you really come and go, that is
your delusion. Let me show you the path on which there is no
coming and no going."

With his words, Ikkyu had revealed the path so clearly that
Ninakawa smilled and passed away.
