He hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are; to know the
disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,

The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their
courses, and the changes of seasons,

The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,

The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds,
and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,

And all such things as are hid and not foreseen, I have learned; for wisdom,
which is the worker of all things, taught me.

For in her is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold, subtile,
eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick,
which nothing hindereth, beneficent.

Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all
things, and containing all spirits, intelligible, pure, subtile.

For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere by
reason of her purity.
