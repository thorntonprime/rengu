Description: January 20
Format: Verse
---
I am, you anxious one.

Don't you sense me, ready to break
into being at your touch?
My murmurings surround you like shadowy wings.
Can't you seem me standing before you
cloaked in stillness?
Hasn't my longing ripened in you
from the beginning
as a fruit ripens on a branch?

I am the dream you are dreaming.
When you want to awaken, I am waiting.
I grow strong in the beauty you behold.
And with the silence of stars I enfold
your cities made by time.
