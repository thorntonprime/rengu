Commentary: |
  The second verse connects the uncut, the uncarved, the unusable, to the idea
  of the unnamed presented in the first chapter： “name’s the mother
  of the ten thousand things.” You have to make order, you have to make
  distinctions, but you also have to know when to stop before you’ve lost
  the whole in the multiplicity of parts. The simplicity or singleness of the
  Way is that of water, which always rejoins itself.

The way goes on forever nameless.
Uncut wood, nothing important,
yet nobody under heaven
dare try to carve it.
If rulers and leaders could use it,
the ten thousand things
would gather in homage,
heaven and earth would drop sweet dew,
and people, without being ordered,
would be fair to one another.

To order, to govern,
is to begin naming;
when names proliferate
it’s time to stop.
If you know when to stop
you’re in no danger.

The Way in the world
is as a stream to a valley,
a river to the sea.
