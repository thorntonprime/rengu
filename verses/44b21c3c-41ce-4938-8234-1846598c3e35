The birds at play： when I can't stand them
 any longer,
I go sleep in my thatched hut.
The cherries in the trees glow bright
as the tips of burning incense,
  and the willow branches sway.
Sun runs up green ridges.
Sunlit clouds wash in the green pool.
Everybody knows： if you want out of the dust,
head up the south side of Cold Mountain.
