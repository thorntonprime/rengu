Say： Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allâh which He hath brought forth for
His bondmen, and the good things of His providing? ...

Say： My Lord forbiddeth only indecencies, such of them as are apparent and
such as are within, and sin and wrongful oppression, and that ye associate with
Allâh that for which no warrant hath been revealed, and that ye tell concerning
Allâh that which ye know not.
