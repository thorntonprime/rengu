Title: The Courageous Dirty Work
---
I am glad someone thinks they are real, real enough that they respond to names,
 real enough to show up
for work on time and pay their bills.
For what would happen to the world if there weren't courageous people like that
 around,
willing to do the dirty work ... of thinking they exist?
