If it (our Art) is founded on the eternal verities of Nature, why need I
trouble my head with the problem whether this or that antediluvian personage
had a knowledge of it? Enough for me to know that it is now true and possible,
that it has been exercised by the initiated for many centuries, and under the
most distant latitudes; it may also be observed that though most of these write
in an obscure, figurative, allegorical, and altogether perplexing style, and
though some of them have actually mixed falsehood with truth, in order to
confound the ignorant, yet they, though existing in many series of ages,
differing in tongue and nation, have not diversely handled one operation, but
do all exhibit a most marvellous and striking agreement in regard to the main
features of their teaching -- an agreement which is absolutely inexplicable,
except on the supposition that our Art is something more than a mere labyrinth
of perplexing words.
