If a soul, when it has entered a human body, persists in evil, it does
not taste the sweets of immortal life, but is dragged back again; it
reverses its course, and takes its way back to the creeping things;
and that ill-fated soul, having failed to know itself, lives in
servitude to uncouth and noxious bodies. To this doom are vicious
souls condemned.
