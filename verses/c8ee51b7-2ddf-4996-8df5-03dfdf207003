  Title: The Clouds Should Know Me by Now
---
Deep and hidden, cicadas
fill the dusk;
startled, you awaken
from a stone-bed sleep.

Near your hut,
a waterfall
falls
thousands of feet.

Pines near the altar
drip dew;
the mountain moon
shines in vast clear space.

When a crane passes over,
you must see --
riderless, it should bear
an immortal.
