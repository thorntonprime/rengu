I used to think that friendship meant happiness： I have learned that it
means discipline. Seek how we may, we shall never find a friend without
faults, imperfections, traits and ways that vex, grieve, annoy us. Strive
as we will, we ourselves can never fully fulfill the ideal of us that is in
our friend’s mind： we inevitably come short of it.
