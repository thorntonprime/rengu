Commentary: John Smith the Platonist puts it even more bluntly, where he
  says of Aristotle： "He hath so defaced the sacred monuments. ... that
  elder philosophy which he so corrupts' (Disc., p. 114). Cf, the citation
  from The Sophic Hydrolith on pp. 734-735. In the intellectual anarchy of
  our times, however, the mastery of Aristotelian logic becomes the
  prerequisite discipline for sane thinking.

I will now set forth the truths which I learnt in hours of solitude, when I
turned away from corporeal things, and turned to the purely spiritual things of
Light, and entered into communication with the divine world, and with some of
the spirits of the celestial realm. I first grasped a definite truth by mystic
intuition, and then sought to demonstrate it by arguments; whereas the
Peripatetics follow the reverse method, letting themselves be led by (logical)
demonstrations, without knowing beforehand the goal to which their arguments
will lead them. Our master is Plato, especially in his works Timaeus and
Phaedo; whereas Aristotle remains the loadstar of those who seek truth by the
empirical method. ... This mystic-Platonic method is a different kind of
philosophy, and a shorter way than that of the Peripatetics, which loses itself
in secondary questions.
