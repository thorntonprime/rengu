He who knows the one reality, beyond the objective world, has true
knowledge. He loves me for the sake of love and does not care even for his
own salvation. Such a free soul is above all rules of conduct and beyond all
orders of life. Though wise, he is childlike. Though subtle, learned, and
well-versed in the Scriptures, he wanders about as one who knows nothing. He
causes no fear to anyone, and he is fearful of none. If vilified, he does
not return the insult but remains calm. He bears enmity towards none.
