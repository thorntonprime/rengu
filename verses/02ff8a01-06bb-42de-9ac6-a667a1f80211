Magic is the formative power in the eternal wisdom ... a mother in all three
worlds, and makes each thing after the model of that thing's will. It is not
the understanding, but a creatrix according to the understanding, and lends
itself to good or to evil; ... of use to the children for God's kingdom, and to
the sorcerers for the devil’s kingdom.
