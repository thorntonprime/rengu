Title: Falling on a Soft Mat
---
More attentive than any lover or parent is really God to us, but our gauge of
  judgment is impaired by the world's values, and our bodies' often dominance
  over our spirit realm.

A young child first learning to walk and very likely to fall may be allowed to
  do so by a wise guardian or teacher

if there is a soft mat beneath its body that will cushion it from harm.

There is a soft rug you can place around others it is forgiveness, it is
  charity.

We are all still learning to walk -- and fly -- in ways; kin help each other.
  And everything I am related to.
