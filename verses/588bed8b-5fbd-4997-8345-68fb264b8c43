\“In Gojam,” he [the Prince of Ethiopia] said to me, “every
self-respecting man has a war horse except for the priests, and it is wrong
that you should be without one.” [In the evening the Prince sent d’Abbadie
an excellent horse.] ... My acquaintances now came to congratulate me. I
was of course grateful to the Prince for his generosity and courtesy, but
as yet I did not understand their meaning, nor the the eagerness of those
about me who now adopted a more affectionate familiarity.

In this feudal country, however, men are united by an infinity of ties
which would count for nothing in Europe. They live together in a reciprocal
dependence and solidarity which they value highly and consider a matter of
pride, and which influence all they do. A man freed from all subjection
is in their eyes outside the social order; that is how they con- sider
a stranger. In accepting a mule from Dedjas- match I had already, by the
customs of the country, entered into a moral obligation towards him. But
in receiving a war horse I became, in the eyes of his men, the man of their
master; I was obliged to follow him, and at least for a certain time to share
in his fortunes, bad or good. No matter how much good will they might have
shown me until now, I had nonetheless been for them like a being apart, like
one without any social relationship with them. But from now on I was going to
share in their duties and their rights. I was no longer for them a stranger in
the old and hostile sense of the word. I became their comrade, their companion.
