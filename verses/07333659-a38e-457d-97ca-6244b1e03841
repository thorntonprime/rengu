Title: Samadhi of Sorrow
---
Death, clean as the blue light of heaven, cleanses all things.
Quiet night -- the light of void -- reigns over the earth.
By a faint candle, I lie so alone and resolute.
On a sea of tears I released a flower boat.
It carn‘ed my love and sunk without a sound.
Through the samadhi of sorrow, I attained “self void.”

Drunk on flower mist, the beautiful girl
staggers along the vast plain of youth.
Regarding death lighter than a feather,
love’s madman drinks the heart’s fire like it’s ice.

You loser in love, sick on love,
urging your love to kill' itself --
hold me if you want satisfaction.
Don’t you know that my arms embody that love?
