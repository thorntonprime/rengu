When through self, by the suppressing of the mind, one sees the brilliant
Self which is more subtile than the subtile, then having seen the Self through
one’s self, one becomes self-less (nir-âtman). Because of being selfless,
he is to be regarded as incalculable (a-samkhya), without origin -- the mark
of liberation (moksa). This is the supreme secret doctrine (rahasya).
