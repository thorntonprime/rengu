The will turned away from the unchangeable and universal good, and turned to
its own, or some outward or inferior good, sins. It turns to its own, when it
would be in its own power; to an outward, when it strives to know what
belongs to others, or not to itself; to an inferior, when it loves the
pleasures of the body; and thus man, becoming proud, curious, fleshly, passes
over into another life, which, in comparison of the former, is death.
