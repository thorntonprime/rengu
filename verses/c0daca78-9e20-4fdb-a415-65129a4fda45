If you remain silent,
I will fill my heart with your silence and endure it.
I will keep still and wait like the night
with starry vigil.

The morning will surely come,
the darkness will vanish,
and your voice will pour down in golden streams
breaking through the sky.

Then your words will take wing in songs
from every one of my birdsâ€™ nests,
and your melodies will break forth
in flowers in all my forest groves.
