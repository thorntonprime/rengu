Title: To Love and Serve Society
---
Came up to the hermitage at 4 a.m. The moon poured down silence over
the woods, and the frosty grass sparkled faintly. More than two hours of
prayer in f1relight.The sun appeared and rose at 6：45. Sweet pungent
smell of hickory smoke, and silence, silence. But birds again-presence,
awareness. Our sorry idiot life, our idiot existence, idiot not because it
has to be but because it is not what it could be with a little more courage
and care. In the end it all comes down to renunciation, the “infinite
bonding” without which one cannot begin to talk of freedom -- but it must
be renunciation, not mere resignation, abdication, ”giving up.”There
is no simple answer, least of all in the community. The ordinary answers
tend to be confusing and to hide the truth, for which one must struggle
in loneliness -- but why in desperation? This is not necessary.

“All the moral wretchedness as we see it about us is our wretchedness
and our weakness,” says Hromadka, in a powerful article about the
Christian’s concern for the (godless) man of today. From such a one I
am willing to learn. He says the obligation of the Christian in socialist
society is first to understand that society, to love it and serve its
spiritual needs, and to bring up children in truthfulness for the sake of
helping in the task of building a new world.“Not with groaning but with
joyful love for the man of this modern world of ours we want to bring a
service which no one can bring in our stead.”
