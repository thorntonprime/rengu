Commentary: Without the preparation of these foregoing stages, however,
  the ordinary mortal would be shattered by the overwheliming
  intensity of this final state.

Our original Buddha-Nature is, in highest truth, devoid of any atom of
objectivity. It is void, omnipresent, silent, pure; it is glorious and
mysterious peaceful joy -- and that is all. Enter deeply into it by awaking
to it yourself. That which is before you is it, in all its fullness, utterly
complete. There is naught beside. Even if you go through all the stages of
a Bodhisattva’s progress towards Buddhahood, one by one; when at last, in
a single flash, you attain to full realization, you will only be realizing
the Buddha-Nature which has been with you all the time; and by all the
foregoing stages you will have added to it nothing at all. You will come
to look upon those aeons of work and achievement as no better than unreal
actions performed in a dream. That is why the Tathâgata said： ‘I truly
attained nothing from complete, unexcelled Enlightenment.’
