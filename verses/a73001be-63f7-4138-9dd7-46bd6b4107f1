Title: Drinking Tea At Greenmount Pool
Commentary: |
  Ling Yi (d. 762) was one of the first of the more traditionally cultivated
  Zen monks to make “Zen poetry”. Unless I miss the point, I don’t
  think there is anything funny about this poem, except maybe that we still
  usually miss the point. I think here I laugh, maybe as I do with Seng Yu,
  in pure delight.

Wildnerness spring
and smoke and fire
up here, with the white clouds.

Sitting, drinking, the fragrance
of the tea： I love this mountain.

Beneath the cliffs, for now,
stay moored, don’t dare the surge.

Green Creek’s flowing waters：
and the sunset, rushing,
rushing.
