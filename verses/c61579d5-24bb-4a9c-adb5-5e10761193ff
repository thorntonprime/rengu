    Title: Collected French Poems
Title: The Lies We Tell
Description: July 23
Format: Verse
---
The lies we tell are like toys,
easy to break. Like gardens
where we play hide and seek,
and, in our excitement, make a sound
so people will know where to look.

You are the wind that catches our voice,
our own shadow grown longer.
You collection of lovely holes
in the sponge that we are.
