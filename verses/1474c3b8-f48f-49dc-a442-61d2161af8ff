You want to learn to catch a mouse?
Don't take a pampered cat for your teacher.
If you want to learn the nature of the world,
don't study fine bound books.
The True Jewel's in a coarse bag.
The Buddha Nature stops at huts.
The whole herd of folks who clutch
at the outsides of things
never seem to make that connection.
