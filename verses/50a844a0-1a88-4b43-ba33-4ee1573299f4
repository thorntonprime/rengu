Worldly people have no stuff in them. They are like a heap of
cow-dung. Flatterers come to them and say： ‘You are so charitable and
wise! You are so pious ¡’These are not mere words but pointed bamboos
thrust at them. ... Arbitration and leadership?  How trifling these
are! Charity and doing good to others? You have had enough of
these.  ... If you realize God, you will get everything else. First
God, then charity, doing good to others, doing good to the world, and
redeeming people.
