When people are not in awe of power, Power becomes great.
Do not intrude into their homes, Do not make their lives weary. If you do
 not weary them, They will not becoem weary of you.
Therefore the Sage Has self-knowledge without self-display, Self-love
 without personal pride, Rejects one, accepts the other.
