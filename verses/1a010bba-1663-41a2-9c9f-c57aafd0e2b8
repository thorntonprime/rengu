We must learn to act without attachment. But it is rare for anyone
untrained to reach the stage at which he is proof against disturbance
by any act or anybody. This needs prodigiously hard work： and for God
to be as present and to show as plainly to him at all times and in all
company, that is for the expert and demands especially two things. One
is that the man be closeted within himself where his mind is safe from
images of outside things which remain external to him and. alien as
they are. cannot traffic or forgather with him or find any room in him
at all. Secondly, inventions of the mind itself, ideas, spontaneous
notions or images of things outside or whatever comes into his head,
he must give no quarter to on pain of scattering himself and being
sold into multiplicity. His powers must all be trained to turn and
face his inner self.

Thou dost object. ‘But one must turn outwards to do outward works： no
work is wrought except in its own mode.' -- True. But to the expert
soul outward modes are not merely outward things： to the interior
soul all things are modes of the Deity within.
