The truth is, that the outer form of him (the philosopher) only is in the city;
his mind, disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human things, is
‘flying all abroad’ as Pindar says, measuring earth and heaven and the
things which are under and on the earth and above the heaven, interrogating
the whole nature of each and all in their entirety, but not condescending
to anything which is within reach.
