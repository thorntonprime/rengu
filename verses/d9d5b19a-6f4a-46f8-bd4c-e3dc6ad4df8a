After the swallow and the swan, the spring goes.
I reckon carefully the million wafting silks, this floating life,
come like spring dreams, to last how long?
Gone, like morning clouds, beyond searching.
I heard the lute, untied my sash among mild spirits,
yet though my grasping tore their silken robes,
I could not keep them：
(who can hold the spring?) Don't stay the only sober one：
There must be many
sodden drunk
among the flowers.
