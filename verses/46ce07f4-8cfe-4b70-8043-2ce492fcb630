There was a Sadhu in Malabar, a tall and stout person. He was in the
police service before he became a Sadhu. He used to wear only a small
towel round his waist. Once when he was going for his Bhiksha, a
householder, seeing his good physique, asked him why he should not
work and earn his bread, instead of begging for it. The Sadhu was told
that he would be given a meal if he was prepared to cut a few logs of
firewood that were lying in the householder’s courtyard. The Sadhu,
without uttering a word, started cutting the firewood with an axe
given to him and within a short time cut the whole lot and stacked
them in the proper place. Then, keeping the axe there, the Sadhu
simply walked away. The householder saw the Sadhu going away without
taking his food. He called him back and asked him why he was going
away before getting his meal. The Sadhu then replied： ‘I do not take
my food where I work, and I do not work where I take my food!’
