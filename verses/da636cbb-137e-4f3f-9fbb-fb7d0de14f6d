There are some, however, who are not content with the myrrh that God gives
them, but think fit to give themselves some, and create evils for themselves
and sick fancies, and have indeed suffered long and much, for they take hold
of all things by the wrong end. And they gain little grace from all their
pain, because they are building up stones of their own laying, whether it be
penances or abstinence, or prayer or meditation. According to them, God must
wait their leisure, and let them do their part first, else no good will come
of the work. God hath fixed it in His purpose that He will reward nothing
but His own works. In the kingdom of Heaven He will crown nothing to all
eternity but His works, and not thine. What He has not wrought in thee, He
takes no account of.
