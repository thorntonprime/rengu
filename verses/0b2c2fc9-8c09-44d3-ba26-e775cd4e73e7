Title: Rifling Trunks
---
IF ONE IS TO GUARD and take precautions against thieves who rifle
trunks, ransack bags, and break open boxes, then he must bind with
cords and ropes and make fast with locks and hasps. This the ordinary
world calls wisdom. But if a great thief comes along, he will shoulder
the boxes, hoist up the trunks, sling the bags over his back, and dash
off, only worrying that the cords and ropes, the locks and hasps are
not fastened tightly enough. In that case, the man who earlier was
called wise was in fact only piling up goods for the benefit of a great
thief.
