Title: Get Warm and Love God Any Way You Can
---
A great deal of wood I have for the fire is wet or not sufficiently seasoned
to burn well -- though finally this morning I got a pretty hot fire going
with a big cedar log on top of it.

It is hard but good to live according to nature with a primitive technology
of wood chopping and fires rather than according to the mature technology
that has supplanted nature, creating its own weather, etc, etc. Yet there
are advantages, too, in a warmed house and a self-stoking furnace. No need
to pledge allegiance to either one. Get warm any way you can, and love God
and pray.

I see more and more that now I must desire nothing else than to be “poured
out as a libation,” to give and surrender my being without concern. The cold
woods make this more real. And the loneliness： coming up last night at the
time of a very cold sunset, with two little birds still picking at crumbs l had
thrown for them on the frozen porch. Everywhere else, snow. In the morning,
coming down： all tracks covered by snow blown over the path by the wind,
except tracks of the cat that hunts around the old sheep barn. Solitude =
being aware that you are one man in this snow where there has been no one
but one cat.
