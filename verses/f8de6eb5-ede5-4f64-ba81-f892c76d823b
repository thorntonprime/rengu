Reason in a good man sits in the throne, and governs all the powers of his
soul in a sweet harmony and agreement with itself; whereas wicked men live
only £cor¡v §oÍaoTiKr¡v, being led up and down by the foolish fires of
their own sensual apprehensions. In wicked men there is a democracy of wild
lusts and passions, which violently hurry the soul up and down with restless
motions. All sin and wickedness is arácns kol v^pis rfjs <pvx?}s~. 'a sedition
stirred up in the soul by the sensitive powers against reason". It was one
of the great evils that Solomon saw under the sun. ‘Servants on horseback,
and princes going as servants upon the ground’ (Eccles. X. 7). We may find
the moral of it in all wicked men, whose souls are only as servants to wait
upon their senses. In all such men the whole course of nature is turned upside
down, and the cardinal points of motion in this little world are changed to
contrary positions; but the motions of a good man are methodical, regular,
and concentrical to reason.
