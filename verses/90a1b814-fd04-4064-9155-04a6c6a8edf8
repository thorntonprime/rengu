As a mirror in which a person sees the form of himself and cannot see
it without the mirror, such is the relation of God to the Perfect Man,
who cannot possibly see his own form but in the mirror of the name All√¢h;
and he is also a mirror to God, for God laid upon Himself the necessity that
His names and attributes should not be seen save in the Perfect Man.
