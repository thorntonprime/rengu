For thee is a proof of His Mightiness -- may He be magnified -- in that He
has veiled thee from Him by something not existing with Him! ...

How may it be conceived that anything should veil Him without Whom exists
nothing!

O wonder! how can existence appear in non-existence?

Or how can the create endure beside Him whose attribute is the Pre-Existent?
