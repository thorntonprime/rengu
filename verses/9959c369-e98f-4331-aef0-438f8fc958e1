\‘Thou art the Qutb whereon the spheres of beauty revolve, and thou art
the Sun by whose radiance the full-moon of perfection is replenished; thou
art he for whom We set up the pattern and for whose sake We made fast the
door-ring; thou art the reality symbolised by Hind and Salmâ and 'Azza and
Asmâ. O thou who art endued with lofty attributes and pure qualities. Beauty
doth not dumbfound thee nor Majesty cause thee to quake, nor dost thou deem
Perfection unattainable; thou art the centre and these the circumference,
thou art the clothed and these the splendid garments."
