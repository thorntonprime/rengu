There is no halacha without agada, and no agada without halacha. We must
neither disparage the body, nor sacrifice the spirit. The body is the
discipline, the pattern, the law; the spirit is inner devotion, spontaneity,
freedom. The body without the spirit is a corpse; the spirit without the
body is a ghost. Thus a mitsvah is both a discipline and an inspiration,
an act of obedience and an experience of joy, a yoke and a prerogative.

Our task is to learn how to maintain a harmony between the demands of
halacha and the spirit of agada.
