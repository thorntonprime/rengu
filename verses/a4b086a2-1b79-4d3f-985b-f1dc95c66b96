And what rule do you think I walked by? Truly a strange one, but the
best in the whole world. I was guided by an implicit faith in Godâ€™s
goodness; and therefore led to the study of the most obvious and
common things. For thus I thought within myself; God being, as we
generally believe, infinite in goodness, it is most consonant and
agreeable with His nature, that the best things should be most common.
For nothing is more natural to infinite goodness, than to make the
best things most frequent; and only things worthless scarce.
