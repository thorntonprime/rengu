Title: An Untidy Holy Life
---
Today we commemorate Blessed Conrad -- one of the Cistercian hermits.

I might as well say that in the novitiate I did not like the hermits of
our Order. Their stories were inconclusive. They seemed to have died before
finding out what they were supposed to achieve.

Now I know there is something important about the very incompleteness of
Blessed Conrad： hermit in Palestine, by St. Bernard's permission. Starts
home for Clairyaux when he hears St. Bernard is dying. Gets to Italy and
hears St. Bernard is dead. Settles in a wayside chapel outside Bari and
dies there. What an untidily unplanned life. No order, no sense, no system,
no climax. Like a book without punctuation that suddenly ends in the middle
of a sentence.

Yet I know that those are the books I really like!

Blessed Conrad cannot possibly be solidified or ossified in history.
He can perhaps be caught and held in a picture, but he is like a photograph
ofa bird in flight -- too accurate to look the way a flying bird seems to
appear to us. We never saw the wings in that position. Such is the solitary
vocation. For, of all men, the solitary knows least where he is going, and
yet he is more sure, for there is one thing he cannot doubt： he travels
where God is leading him. That is precisely why he doesn't know the way. And
that too is why, to most other men, the way is something of a scandal.
