Die you must to all and everything that you have worked or done under
any other spirit but that of meekness, humility, and true resignation
to God. Everything else, be it what it will, has its rise from the
fire of nature, it belongs to nothing else and must of all necessity
be given up. lost, and taken from you again by fire, either here or
hereafter.
