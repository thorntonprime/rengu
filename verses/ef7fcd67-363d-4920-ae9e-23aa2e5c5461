think then that the aim of the perfect Courtier ... is so to win for
himself, by means of the accomplishments ascribed to him by these gentlemen,
the favour and mind of the prince whom he serves, that he may be able to
say, and always shall say, the truth about everything which it is fitting
for the prince to know, without fear or risk of giving offence thereby;
and that when he sees his prince’s mind inclined to do something wrong,
he may be quick to oppose, and gently to make use of the favour acquired
by his good accomplishments, so as to banish every bad intent and lead
his prince into the path of virtue. And thus, possessing the goodness
which these gentlemen have described, together with readiness of wit and
pleasantness, and shrewdness and knowledge of letters and many other
things, the courtier will in every case be able deftly to show the
prince how much honour and profit accrue to him and his from justice,
liberality, magnanimity, gentleness, and the other virtues that become
a good prince; and on the other hand how much infamy and loss proceed
from the vices opposed to them. Therefore I think that just as music,
festivals, games, and the other pleasant accomplishments are, as it were,
the flower, in like manner to lead or help one’s prince toward right,
and to frighten him from wrong, are the true fruit of Courtiership. ...

In this way the Courtier will be able to lead his prince along the thorny
path of virtue, decking it as with shady leafage and strewing it with lovely
flowers to relieve the tedium of the weary journey to one whose strength
is slight; and now with music, now with arms and horses, now with verses,
now with love talk, and wit with all those means whereof these gentlemen
have told, to keep his mind continually busied with worldly pleasures, yet
always impressing upon him also, as I have said, some virtuous practice
along with these allurements, and playing upon him with salutary craft;
like cunning doctors, who often anoint the edge of the cup with a sweet
cordial, when they wish to give some bitter-tasting medicine to sick and
over-delicate children.
