Jesus said to His disciples： Make a comparison to Me and tell Me whom I am
like. Simon Peter said to Him： Thou art like a righteous angel. Matthew
said to Him： Thou art like a wise man of understanding. Thomas said to
Him： Master, my mouth will not at all be capable of saying whom Thou art
like. Jesus said： I am not thy Master, because thou hast drunk, thou hast
become drunk from the bubbling spring which I have measured out. And He took
him. He withdrew. He spoke three words to him.

Now when Thomas came to his companions, they asked him： What did Jesus
say to thee? Thomas said to them： If I tell you one of the words which He
said to me, you will take up stones and throw at me： and fire will come
from the stones and burn you up.
