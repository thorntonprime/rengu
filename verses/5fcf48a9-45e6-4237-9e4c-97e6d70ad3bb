Title: The Bed of the Sick
Description: June 4
---
God is always there, beside the bed of the sick. So many times He holds a cup
  to their mouths and strokes their head.

If you don’t believe me, try picturing that in your mind, happening to you.

Enact this beautiful scene if ever you feel in need of the Beloved’s presence.

That is what an imagination is for. Can you think of anything better to do with
  it? And who is to say it won’t become real ... somewhere along your path.
