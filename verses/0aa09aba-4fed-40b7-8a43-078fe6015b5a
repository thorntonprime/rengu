Title: Prophets have conquered heaven with faith
---
Such an odd thing for
    the God-inspired to say!
But that heaven is common,
    full of places that we knowï¼š
the world, which one needs
    a poor spirit to rule.
The body, that one overcomes only
    with hunger and thirst.
And the devil. To conquer it
    we love our pain and grief.
