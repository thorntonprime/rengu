Seeing but not seeing, we call it dim. Listening but not hearing, we call
 it faint. Groping but not touching, we call it subtle.
These three cannot be fully grasped. Therefore they become one.
Rising, it is not bright; setting it is not dark. It moves all things back
 to where there is nothing
Meeting it there is no front, following it there is no back.
Live in the ancient Tao, Master the existing present, Understand the source
 of all things. This is called the record of Tao.
