Jingqing asked a monk, "What is the sound outside the
door?"

The monk said, "The sound of rain drops."

Qing said, "The multitude of beings are topsy-turvey,
confused by the self to chase objects."

The monk said, "Venerable how do you make it alive?"

Qing said, "Soaked is not confused by the self."

The monk said, "So what is the intended meaning of 'Soaked
is not confused by the self'?"

Qing said, "To exit the living-body may yet be easy; to
speak of the peeled-off entity-body ought to be difficult. Soaked."
