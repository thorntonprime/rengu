---
He who holds the Great Symbol will attract all things to him.
They flock to him and receive no harm, for in him they find peace, security
 and happiness.

Music and dainty dishes can only make a passing guest pause.
But the words of Tao possess lasting effects,
Though they are mild and flavourless,
Though they appeal neither to the eye nor to the ear.
