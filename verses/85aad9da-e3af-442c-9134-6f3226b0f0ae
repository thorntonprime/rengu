Muzhou asked a monk, "What place did you leave from
nearby?"

The monk then shouted.

Zhou said, "This old monk, because of you, has one shout."

The monk again shouted.

Zhou said, "After three shouts and four shouts, how do you
make it come alive?"

The monk was speechless.

Zhou then hit him and said, "This is the top fellow of
robbing and deceiving."
