While the great King Solomon ... was composing the sacred Canticle of
Canticles, he had, according to the permission of those ages, a great variety
of ladies and maidens attached to his service in different conditions and
qualities. ... Now under the figure of what passed in his palace, he described
the various perfections of souls who in time to come were to adore, love and
serve the great Pacific King Jesus Christ.
