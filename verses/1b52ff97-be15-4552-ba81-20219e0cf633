The third commandment enjoins quietness of heart, tranquility of mind. This
is holiness. Because here is the Spirit of God. This is what a true holiday
means, quietness and rest. Unquiet people recoil from the Holy Spirit. They
love quarrelling. They love argument. In their restlessness they do not
allow the silence of the Lord’s Sabbath to enter their lives. Against such
restlessness we are offered a kind of Sabbath in the heart. As if God were
saying “Stop being so restless, quieten the uproar in your minds. Let go
of the idle fantasies that fly around in your head.” God is saying, “Be
still and see that I am God”. But you refuse to be still. You are like
the Egyptians tormented by gnats. These tiniest of flies, always restless,
flying about aimlessly, swarm at your eyes, giving no rest. They are back
as soon as you drive them off. Just like the futile fantasies that swarm in
our minds. Keep the commandment. Beware of this plague.
