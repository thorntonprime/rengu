Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw
 dogs;
the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.

Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?
It is empty without being exhaustedï¼š
The more it works the more comes out.

Much speech leads inevitably to silence.
Better to hold fast to the void.
