Disciple： Mahârâj, how can one awaken the kundalini?

The Swâmi： By the practice of japa, meditation (dhyâna) and other spiritual
exercises. According to certain yogins, there are special forms of meditation
or practices which awaken it, but I think the most efficacious ar ejapa and
dhyâna. The practice of japa is expecially suited for our present time,
the iron age (kali-yuga). There is no spiritual practice more easy. But
meditation must accompany the repetition of the mantra.
