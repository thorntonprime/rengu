Title: I Saw You
---
You left and I can’t forget.
The fault is mine, not yours.

Without any land to till, there’s no harvest.
With nothing to eat I went to a neighboring house for potatoes and millet,
But its master said, “Beggars have no humanity.
  Those without humanity have no life'.
  It would be a crime to help you.”
As I was returning home, through my streaming tears, I saw you.

I have no home; I’m not counted on the census.
  “The uncounted have no rights.
  With no rights, what virtue can you have?”
asked the general who tried to violate me.
I resisted, and as my hatred turned to sorrow I saw you.

Yes, I understand ethics, morality, law
 are nothing but the smoke worshipping the sword and gold.
Shall I accept eternal love?
Shall I blot out the first pages of human history?
Shall I take to drink?
As I wavered, I saw you.
