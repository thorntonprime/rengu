Title: Don't Work So Hard
---
At the heart of things is an eternal present
moment which is in each and every thing

that is -- and in me and in you, and when
we let ourselves come into an awareness of

this Now we come to know ourselves as
a becoming-new without renewal, and this

is the truth beyond all our worries and needs
and hopes, this one eternal present moment.
