A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.
Grass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and
 shrivelled when dead.
Thus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;
The supple and the weak are the comrades of life.

Therefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;
A tree that is strong will suffer the axe.
The strong and big takes the lower position,
The supple and weak takes the higher position.
