There are two ways： one is to expand your ego to infinity, and the
other is to reduce it to nothing, the former by knowledge, and the latter
by devotion. The Jnani says： ‘I am God -- the Universal Truth.’ The
devotee says： ‘I am nothing, O God, You are everything.’ In both cases,
the ego-sense disappears.
