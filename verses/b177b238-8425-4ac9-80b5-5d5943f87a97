Title: You Must Have Been Drugged
Format: verse
---
If you were my student I would make you
remember this, before I would let
you near

I might even have you recite it for a while
whenever we met just to make sure it was
finding a lasting nook in your brainï¼š

Need brings us together; that makes need sacred.
If a person did not have some kind of thirst,
would she ever approach you on her own?

Would his eye ever ask your eye for comfort?
Would his hand ever want to hold yours?

The oasis does not sleep; it is always open; its
very being invites one close; anything you want
from its body, it will say ... why not?

THough surely amongst us there should be limits
for a while so that the well can continue to give.

Nevertheless, become an oasis for all things. For
the finite is a tree growing into the infinite.

Golly, on second thought I hop all that is in
italic up yonder, you soon forget!

Hafiz, I don't think you really wrote all this!
You must have been drugged!!
