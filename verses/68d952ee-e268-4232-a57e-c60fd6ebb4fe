I.

My home’s in the Snake’s Gate Hills.
That’s west of west, over that way ...
There, there’s an Oriole that sings.
Well, Now, I’m not over there, where the Oriole sings,
but the Oriole sings, where it does sing, still.

II.

My home’s in the Snake’s Gate Hills,
Over here, year in year out, there’s a flower blooms red.
Well now ... when I’m not where the red blossom’s red,
that blossom blooms where it blooms, red, still.
