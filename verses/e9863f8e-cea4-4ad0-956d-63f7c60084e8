As we progress along the spiritual path we meet with the tests of
our apprenticeship. Before each step forward there is always the testing time.
When it arrives, if we do not falter, and, above all, do not think that it is
evil, or that we have done something wrong, or that we are suffering from an
injustice, we find it isall good.
