You have made me endless.
Such is your pleasure.
This frail vessel you empty again and again,
and fill it ever with fresh life.

This little flute of a reed
you have carried over hills and dales,
and have breathed through it eternally new melodies.

At the immortal touch of your hands
my little heart loses its limits in joy
and gives birth to utterance ineffable.
Your infinite gifts come to me
only on these very small hands of mine.
Ages pass, and still you pour,
and still there is room to fill.
