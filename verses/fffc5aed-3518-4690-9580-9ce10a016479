Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard
 and strong Nothing can conquer so easily.
Weak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard. Everyone knows this, no one
 attains it.
Therefore the Sage saysï¼š Accept a country's filth And become master of its
 sacred soil. Accepts country's ill fortune And become king under heaven.
 True words resemble their opposites.
