High Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te
 is not.
Those highest in Te take no action And don't need to act. Tose lowest in Te
 take action And do need to act.
Those highest in benevolence take action But don't need to act. Those
 highest in righteousness take action And do need to act. Those highest in
 propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their
 sleeves and throw them out.
Therefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose
 benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety
 follows.
Propriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity： Confusion begins. Foreknowledge
 glorifies the Tao： Stupidity sets in.
And so the ideal person dwells In substance, not dilution, In reality, not
 glory, Accepts one, rejects the other.
