\"It's not surprising you felt that way," said the emperor. "I performed
it through man, tuned it to Heaven, went forward with ritual principle,
and established it in Great Purity. Perfect music must first respond to
the needs of man, accord with the reason of Heaven, proceed by the Five
Virtues, and blend with spontaneity; only then can it bring order to
the four seasons and bestow a final harmony upon the ten thousand
things. Then the four seasons will rise one after the other, the ten
thousand things will take their turn at living. Now flourishing, now
decaying, the civil and military strains will keep them in step; now
with clear notes, now with dull ones, the yin and the yang will blend
all in harmony, the sounds flowing forth like light, like hibernating
insects that start to wriggle again, like the crash of thunder with
which I awe the world. At the end, no tail; at the beginning, no head;
now dead, now alive, now flat on the ground, now up on its feet, its
constancy is unending, yet there is nothing that can be counted on.
That's why you felt afraid.
