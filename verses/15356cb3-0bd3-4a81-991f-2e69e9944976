I believe that the sum total of the energy of mankind is not to bring us down
but to lift us up, and that is the result of the definite, if unconscious,
working of the law of love. The fact that mankind persists shows that the
cohesive force is greater than the disruptive force, centripetal force
greater than centrifugal.
