Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher
---
The True Man of ancient times slept without dreaming and woke without
care; he ate without savoring and his breath came from deep inside. The
True Man breathes with his heels; the mass of men breathe with their
throats. Crushed and bound down, they gasp out their words as though
they were retching. Deep in their passions and desires, they are
shallow in the workings of Heaven.
