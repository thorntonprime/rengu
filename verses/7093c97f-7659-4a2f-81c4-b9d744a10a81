Beauty addresses itself chiefly to sight; but there is a beauty for the hearing
too, as in certain combinations of words and in all kinds of music, for
melodies and cadences are beautiful; and minds that lift themselves above the
realm of sense to a higher order are aware of beauty in the conduct of life, in
actions, in character, in the pursuits of the intellect; and there is the
beauty of the virtues.
