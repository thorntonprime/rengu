Once He raised me up and stationed me before Him, and said to me. ‘O Abû
Yazid, truly My creation desire to see thee.’ I said, ‘Adorn me in Thy
Unity, and clothe me in Thy Selfhood, and raise me up to Thy Oneness, so
that when Thy creation see me they will say, We have seen Thee; and Thou
wilt be That, and I shall not be there at all.'
