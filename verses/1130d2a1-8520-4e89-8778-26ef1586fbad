Title: That by indiscretion in this, men shall keep discretion in all
  other things; and surely else never
---
But peradventure thou askest me, how thou shalt govern thee discreetly in
meat and in sleep, and in all these other. And hereto I think to answer
thee right shortly： “Get that thou get mayest.” Do this work evermore
without ceasing and without discretion, and thou shalt well ken begin and
cease in all other works with a great discretion. For I may not trow that
a soul continuing in this work night and day without discretion, should err
in any of these outward doings; and else, me think that he should always err.

And therefore, an I might get a waking and a busy beholding to this ghostly
work within in my soul, I would then have a heedlessness in eating and in
drinking, in sleeping and in speaking, and in all mine outward doings. For
surely I trow I should rather come to discretion in them by such a
heedlessness, than by any busy beholding to the same things, as I would
by that beholding set a mark and a measure by them. Truly I should never
bring it so about, for ought that I could do or say. Say what men say will,
and let the proof witness. And therefore lift up thine heart with a blind
stirring of love; and mean now sin, and now God. God wouldest thou have,
and sin wouldest thou lack. God wanteth thee; and sin art thou sure of. Now
good God help thee, for now hast thou need!
