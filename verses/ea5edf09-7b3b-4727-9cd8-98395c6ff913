I feel that my mission is going to begin, my mission to have God loved as I
love Him, to give my little way to souls. I want to spend my heaven in doing
good on earth. This is not impossible, since the angels at the center of the
beatific vision watch over us. No. until the end of the world, and as long as
there will be souls to save. I shall be able to take no rest; but when the
angel shall have said： ‘Time no longer is!’ then shall I rest, then shall I
delight, because the number of the elect will be complete, and all will have
entered into joy and repose. My heart leaps at the thought.
