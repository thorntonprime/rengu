I, Hônen, in my original being, am really Seishi, the great Boddhisattva,
who has appeared here in this Temple for the salvation of sentient beings. I
am every day with all who follow me, and I shall protect them and assuredly
bring them to the Land of Perfect Bliss. If I should fail to make this vow
effective, I would never accept of perfect enlightenment myself.
