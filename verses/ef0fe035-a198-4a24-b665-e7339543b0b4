\“Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You must not expect the world to
act as you do.” A critic once made this observation.

“It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the body can be
improved, but that it is impossible to evoke the hidden powers of the soul,"
Gandhi replied. “I am engaged in trying to show that if] have any of those
powers, I am as frail a mortal as any of us and that I never had anything
extraordinary about me nor have I now. I am a simple individual liable to err
like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that l have enough humility to
conless my errors and to retrace my steps. I own that I have an immovable
faith in God and His goodness, and an unconsumable passion for truth and
love. But is that not what every person has latent in him?" He added：
"If we may make new discoveries and inventions in the phenomenal world,
must we declare our bankruptcy in the spiritual domain? Is it impossible
to multiply the exceptions so as to make them the rule? Must man always be
brute first and man after, if at all?"
