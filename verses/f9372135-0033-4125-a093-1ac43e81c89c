A root set in the, finest soil, in the best climate, and blessed with all that
sun, and air, and rain can do for it, is not in so sure a way of its growth to
perfection as every man may be whose spirit aspires after all that which God is
ready and infinitely desirous to give him.  For the sun meets not the springing
bud that stretches towards him with half the certainty as God, the source of
all good, communicates Himself to the soul that longs to partake of Him.
