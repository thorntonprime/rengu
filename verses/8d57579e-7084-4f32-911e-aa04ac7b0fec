No multiplicity can exist except by some participation in the One; that which
is many in its parts is one in its entirety; that which is many in its
accidental qualities is one in its substance; that which is many in number or
faculties is one in species; that which is many in its emanating activities is
one in its originating essence. There is naught in the world without some
participation in the One, the Which in Its all-embracing Unity contains
beforehand all things, and all things conjointly, combining even opposites
under the form of oneness. And without the One there can be no Multiplicity;
yet contrariwise the One can exist without the Multiplicity just as the Unit
exists before all multiplied Number. And if all things be conceived as being
ultimately unified with each other, then all things taken as a whole are
One.  ... If you take away the One there will remain neither whole nor part nor
anything else in the world; for all things are contained beforehand and
embraced by the One as an Unity in Itself.
