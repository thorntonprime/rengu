Title: Yantou Retrieves a Sword
---
Yantou asked a monk, What place did you come from?

The monk said, I came from the Western capital.

Tou said, After Huangchao (Yellow-nest) passed away and
returned to his origin place, were you able to retrieve his sword?

The monk said, I was able to retrieve it.

Yantou pulled out his neck close in front and said,

The monk said, The masters head has fallen!

Yantou guffawed and guffawed great laughter.

The monk later arrived at Xuefengs.

Feng said, What place did you come from?

The monk said, I came from Yantou.

Feng said, What words and phrases did he have?

The monk raised the previous discussion.

Xuefeng hit 30 blows with the stick and chased him away.
