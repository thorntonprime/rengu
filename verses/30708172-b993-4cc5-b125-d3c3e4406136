Title: The Crooked Tree
---
As long as I do not pretend I suffer, as long as I do not trade in false
coin nor camp too much upon flowers, nor claim that I have disappeared,
my brothersâ€™ prayers can always mend me. The windows are open. Let
the psalms fly in. Prime each morning makes me safe and free. The Day
Hours sustain me with their economy. By night I am buried in Christ. At
3 a.m. I wear the old white vestments and say the Mass of the Blessed
Virgin. Through the gaps in my own prayer come the psalms of the night
office that I discovered again in the woods yesterday afternoon.

There, there is the crooked tree, the moss with my secrets, those pines
upon that cliff of shake, the valley living with the tunes of diesel
trains. Nobody knows the exact place I speak of, and why should I tell
them? For every man is his own jacob. He wakes up at the foot of his
own ladder and sees the angels going up and down, with God at the top
of the ladder. And thus he wakes up in his own unrecognizable house,
his gate of heaven.
