Therefore is it said： ‘The perception of a phenomenon is the perception
of the Universal Nature, since phenomena and Mind are one and the same.’
It is only because you cling to outward forms that you come to ‘see’,
‘hear’, ‘feel’ and ‘know’ things as individual entities. True perception
is beyond your powers so long as you indulge in these.
