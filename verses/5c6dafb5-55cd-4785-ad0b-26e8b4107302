The very sight of him [Tiberius] drew tears of joy from the soldiers. They
were all eagerness, with a sort of unexampled rapture in their salutation
and a passion for touching his hand： they could not restrain themselves
from immediately adding “Is it really you, General? Have we got you
back in safety?” and then, “I was with you in Armenia, General,”
“I was in Raetia,” “I had a reward from you in Vindelicia,” “I in
Pannonia,” “I in Germany" -- a scene not to be expressed in words,
and perhaps scarcely of winning belief.
