Title: Nirvana Shatakam
---
I am not mind, not intellect, not ego, not thought.
I am not the ears, the tongue, the nose or the eyes, or what they witness,
I am neither earth nor sky, not air or light.

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Bhiva! I am Shiva!

I am not the breath ofprana, not itsfive currents.
I am not the seven elements, not thefive organs,
Neither am I the voice nor hands nor anything that acts.

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Bhiva! I am Shiva!

I have no hatred orpreference, neithergreed nor desire nor delusion.
Pride, conflict, jealousy-- these have no part of me.
Nothing do I own, nothing do I seek, not even liberation itself

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Bhiva! I am Shiva!

I know neither virtue nor vice, neither pleasure nor pain.
I know no sacred chants, no holy places, no scriptures, no rituals.
I know neither the taste nor the taster.

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Bhiva! I am Shiva!

I fear not death. I doubt neither my being nor my place.
I have no father or mother; I am unborn.
I have no relatives, no friends. I have no guru and no devotees.

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

Free from doubt, I am formless.
With knowledge, in knowledge, I am everywhere, beyond perception.
I am always the same. Not free, not trapped-- I am.

I am knowledge and bliss.
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

Truly, I am Shiva, pure awareness.
Shivo Ham! Shivo Ham!
