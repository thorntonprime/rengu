Title: Gratitude
---
It is hard to feel a sense ofgratitude for an inanimate, mechanical world
proceeding inexorably in accordance with eternal laws of nature and blind
chance. And this is a great spiritual loss, for it is through gratitude
that we acknowledge the living powers on which our own lives depend;
through gratitude we enter into a conscious relationship to them; through
gratitude we can find ourselves in a state of grace.

All religions provide opportunities for giving thanks, both through simple
everyday rituals, like saying grace before meals, and also in collective
acts of thanksgiving. These customary expressions of gratitude help to
remind us that we have much to be thankful for. Each religion has its
own ways of recognizing the living powers on which we all depend and of
establishing a relationship to these powers through thanksgiving.

For those for whom traditional religious practices seem empty and
meaningless, there are three possibilitiesï¼š first, to recognize no
living power greater than humanity and hence to recognize neither a
need for gratitude nor a means ofexpressing it; second, to feel such
gratitude privately but with no means of public expression; third, to
find new ways of expressing gratitude collectively and new conceptions
of the life-giving powers to whom thanks are due.
