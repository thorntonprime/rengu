Supposing here is a small state with few people.
Though there are various vessels I will not have them put in use.
I will make the people regard death as a grave matter and not go far away.
Though they have boats and carriages they will not travel in them：
Though they have armours and weapons they will not show them.
I will let them restore the use of knotted cords (instead of writing).
They will be satisfied with their food;
Delighted in their dress;
Comfortable in their dwellings;
Happy with their customs.
Though the neighbouring states are within sight
And their cocks’ crowing and dogs’ barking within hearing;
The people (of the small state) will not go there all their lives.
