Title: The Self We Share
Description: June 26
---
Look fish, you are already in the ocean.
Just swimming there makes you friends with glory.

What are these grudges about?
You are Benjamin.
Joseph has put a gold cup in your grain sack
and accused you of being a thief.

Now he draws you aside and says,
You are my brother. I am a prayer. You are the Amen.

We move in eternal regions,
yet we worry about property here.

Let this be the prayer of eachï¼š

You are the source of my life.
You bring rivers from the mountain springs.
You brighten my eyes.

The wine you offer takes me out of myself
into the self we share.

Doing that is religion.
