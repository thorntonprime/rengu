Title: My Faith Increased a Bunch
Description: April 4
---
When the billboards and neons near Godâ€™s inner kingdom started to read
with signs like this -- Piety Not Welcome --

my faith in God increased a bunch. That is, I felt a reasonable
decoding, a translation of that message was, We need to loosen up.

And those were always my sentiments ... exactly.
