Something there once was,
vaguely formed, yet complete unto itself,
emerging afore heaven and earth,
without voice, without dimension,
without otherness, without change,
whence all things were born.
Who knows its name?
I know it as "the Way."
If name there be,
then call it "Great".
â€”for great means ever-flowing,
ever-flowing, hence far-reaching.
Far-reaching, it may come full circle.

The Way is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and so is the man of integrity!
Men accord with earth,
earth with heaven,
heaven with the Way,
and the Way upon itself unfolds.
