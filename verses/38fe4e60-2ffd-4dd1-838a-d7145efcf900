Title: The Diamond Sutra's Belittled and Despised

\[Yuanwu's] Appended pointer says：

A test is raised for examination：

Raised：

The Diamond Sutra says, "If one becomes a person
belittled and despised, indeed the person's previous life's karma of
wrongdoing has responded by falling into evil paths. According to the
present life, because the person is belittled and despised, the
previous life's karma of wrongdoing as a rule becomes extinguished."
