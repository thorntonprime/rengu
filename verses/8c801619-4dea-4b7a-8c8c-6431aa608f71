Title: Ibn 'Arabi and the Christ
---
My heart holds with it all form, that my heart created.
I have made a pasture there for gazelles and children.

Within me is a true monastery for monks of every creed.
There, I pledge perfect obedience to Light, and when any
vows are broken or a shadow you enthrone, I am to blame,
who else? All acts enrich us -- thoufh be caredul in this
realm of thought, of freedom.

Where I have allowed the Inconceivable to appear and
pretend it has a name or shape -- churches, temples, and
mosques are built and obscure the Indivisible. Holy books
were written trying to describe a mere kiss on the cheek
God and I gave this earth.

The only real Sufi is one who turns into the root of my soul,
and discovers every religion pays us homage. This is not
blasphemy, all other experience is. But keep this a secret
from a crazed mind with a stone in its hand.

Whisper softly the word love if you do not have the strength
to let it annihilate you in silence. Burn into the Illumined
Immaculate Nothing where paradise draws itself from a well
you dug.

A thousand shields you hold up against Allah and other
human beings, because your surrender to Knowledge is
not ripe. The Sun smiles through upon any who wave a
sword at it, knowing it is safe from harm, as is your essence.

Don't let your golden wings suffer, let them taste the Beloved's
lips; there is something in tour heart that can lift them into
the Sky's oasis.

The galaxies you invented. The firmament is a nest you once
built. When existence hatched you brought us food of divinity.

Our heart holds within it all forms, that our hearts created.
We have made a meadow there for gazelles, children, music,
dance and dreams.
