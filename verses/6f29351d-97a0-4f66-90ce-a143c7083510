Title: Two Poems for the Price of One / Cherished
---
Every place where His mouth touched my body a poem came out.
And there is not one speck of me He did not kiss.
The above reminds me of some lines I found that rolled off a mountain and
 I put in a sweet ditty called thisï¼š

CHERISHED
If you were near darling, I could kiss you in a way you would feel was perfect,
so perfect it would then protect you from other kisses ... that really did
 not mean it.
I am hoping science evolves soon, soon enough to where anyone who wants can
 carry a simple kind of Geiger counter
that will go off-when any asshole gets near who might cause trouble.
Because, as I said, I want to protect you. For you are my sweetheart, my
 pigeon, my tomato, my dumpling ... and all kinds of things.
