I am that supplicant who make supplication to thee;
The anguish inspired by a charmer like thee hath for me a thousand charms.
Thou art the sun of mine eyes-they are radiant with thy beauty.
If I draw them away from thee, to whom shall I look again?
I will not become inconstant to thee on account of thy cruel treatment;
By remaining constant myself I will restrain thee from cruelty.
I complained of thee, thou saidstï¼š'Provide thine own remedy.'
I am one whose heart provides a remedy for Divine affliction.
I will not tell thee my heart's grief, for it would weary thee;
I will shorten this tale, for mille is a long grief.
