Master Sang-hu, Meng-tzu Fan, and Master Chin-chang, three friends,
said to each other, "Who can join with others without joining with
others? Who can do with others without doing with others? Who can climb
up to heaven and wander in the mists, roam the infinite, and forget
life forever and forever?" The three men looked at each other and
smiled. There was no disagreement in their hearts and so they became
friends.
