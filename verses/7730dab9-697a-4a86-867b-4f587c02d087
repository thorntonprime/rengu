The quest of Truth involves tapas -- self-suffering, sometimes even unto
death. There can be no place in it for even a trace of self-interest. In such
selfless search for Truth nobody can lose his bearings for long. Directly
one takes to the wrong path one stumbles and is thus redirected to the
right path. Therefore the pursuit of Truth is true bhakti (devotion). It
is the path that leads to God and therefore there is no place in it for
cowardice, no place for defeat. It is the talisman by which death itself
becomes the portal to life eternal.
