Title: Solitude Is a Stern Mother
---
I see more and more that solitude is not something to play with. It is deadly
serious. And much as I have wanted it, I have not been serious enough. It is
not enough to “like solitude,” or love it even. Even if you “like” it,
it can wreck you, I believe, if you desire it only for your own sake. So I go
forward (I don’t believe I would go back. Even interiorly I have reached,
at least relatively, a point of no return), but I go in fear and trembling,
and often with a sense of lostness, and trying to be careful what I do
because I am beginning to see that every false step is paid for dearly. Hence
I fall back on prayer, or try to.Yet no matter, there is great beauty and
peace in this life of silence and emptiness. But to fool around brings awful
desolation.When one is trifling, even the beauty of the solitary life becomes
implacable. Solitude is a stern mother who brooks no nonsense. The question
arises： am I so full of nonsense that she will cast me out? I pray not,
and think it is going to take much prayer.
