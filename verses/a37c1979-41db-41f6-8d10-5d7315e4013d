Vishnu, with the quality of goodness and of immeasurable power, preserves
created things through successive ages, until the close of the period termed a
Kalpa; when the same mighty deity, invested with the quality of darkness,
assumes the awful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having thus
devoured all things, and converted the world into one vast ocean, the Supreme
reposes upon his mighty serpent couch amidst the deep; he awakes after a
season, and again, as Brahmâ, becomes the author of creation.
