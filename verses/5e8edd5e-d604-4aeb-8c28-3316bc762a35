I trow this (ecstasy) is given to none meedfully, but freely to whom Christ
will; nevertheless I trow no man receives it unless he specially love the
Name of Jesu, and in so mickle honours It that he never lets It pass from
his mind except in sleep. I trow that he to whom it is given to do that,
may fulfil the same.
