If an unknown man takes aim at me in the middle of a forest, I am not yet
certain that he wishes to kill; must I allow him time to fire in order to
be sure of his intent? Is there any reasonable casuist who would deny me
the right to forestall the act? But presumption becomes almost equal to
certitude if the prince who is about to acquire enormous power has already
given evidence of an unbridled pride and ambition. In the imaginary case
mentioned above, who would have dared counsel the European states to allow
Louis XIV to make such a formidable addition to his power?
