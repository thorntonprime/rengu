Title: God's Vestige in His Creatures
---
Yesterday I was sitting in the woodshed reading and a little Carolina wren
suddenly hopped onto my shoulder and then onto the corner of the book I
was reading and paused a second to take a look at me before flying away.

There is something you cannot know about a wren by cutting it up in a
laboratory and that you can know only ifit remains fully and completely
a wren, itself, and hops on your shoulder ifit feels like it.

A tame animal is already invested with a certain falsity by its tameness. By
becoming what we want it to be, it takes a disguise that we have decided
to impose upon it.

Even a wild animal merely “observed” is not seen as it really is, but
rather in the light of our investigation (color changed by fluorescent
lighting). But people who watch birds and animals are already wise in
their way.

I want not only to observe but to know living things, and this implies
a dimension of primordial familiarity that is simple and primitive and
religious and poor. This is the reality I need, the vestige of God in
His creatures.
