For where there is true love, a man is neither out of measure lifted up by
prosperity, nor cast down by mishapï¼š whether you give or take away from him.
so long as he keeps his beloved, he has a spring of inward peace. Thus, even
though thy outward man grieve, or weep downright, that may well be borne, if
only thy inner man remain at peace, perfectly content with the will of God.
