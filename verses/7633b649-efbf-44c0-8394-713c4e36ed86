Title: Free And Easy Wandering
---
\"He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway Ku-she Mountain,
with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He
doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs
up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond
the four seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures
from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. I thought this
was all insane and refused to believe it."
