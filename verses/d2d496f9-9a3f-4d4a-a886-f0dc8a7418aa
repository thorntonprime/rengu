As a lamp must go out if it is not constantly fed with oil; so the inward
fire of man, unless it is assiduously kept up, gradually begins to burn low,
and is at length completely extinguished. Therefore it is indispensable
for a Christian diligently to hear, carefully to study, and faithfully to
practice the Word of God.
