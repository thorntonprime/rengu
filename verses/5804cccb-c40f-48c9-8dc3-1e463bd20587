Title: Teach Me How to Waken

I could be like lonely
All the lies who I lie
And what happened to later
All my tenderness died
And what seems into purpose
Bring the words of mind
And whatever will pall us
And Iâ€™m harder inside

Teach me how to waken
Teach me how to mend
Love is the beginning
And love is the end

And there comes a shadow
Sudden covering mouths
What are we take of?
We are afraid of a rat
My terms are important
But your measure unwrapped
What happened could hold us
In my hand upside

Teach me how to waken
Teach me how to mend
Love is the beginning
And love is the end

Teach me how to waken
Teach me how to mend
Love is the beginning
And love is the end

Teach me how to waken
Teach me how to mend
Love is the beginning
And love is the end

Love is the beginning
And love is the end

Love is the beginning
And love is the end
