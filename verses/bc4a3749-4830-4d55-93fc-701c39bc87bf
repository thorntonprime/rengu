The Pure Land of mystic adornment is nothing but the great Sun Buddha’s
Palace; and the Land of Perfect Bliss is the Land of Amida’s heart. Amida
is but an intellectual faculty of the great Sun Buddha, who is the substance
of Amida’s person. The land of mystic adornment is coextensive with the
Land of Perfect Bliss, and the latter is really the former under a special
aspect. All the highest possible blessednesses have their centre in that
Pure Land of mystic adornment, from which the name of Amida and of his land
is derived. Amida’s Pure Land is really everywhere, so that the place
where we meditate upon him is verily his own land. When we come to realize
the truth of this, we do not need to leave this present fleeting world at
all to get to the Pure Land, but we are already there. And in our present
bodies and persons, just as we are, we are assimilated to Amida, and he to
the great Sun Buddha, whose we are and from whom we derive our being. This,
then, is the path of meditation by which, just as we are, we attain Buddhahood.
