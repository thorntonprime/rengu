Religion is a matter of experience. Merely by becoming a member of a
church, creed or sect, a person cannot be entitled to this experience.
By reading any amount of scriptures and sacred books he cannot obtain
this experience. By the observance of rites, ceremonies, or worship a
man cannot come by this experience. Spiritual realisation is a
question of individual effort and struggle. ... The man of true
religion when he is on the path, is mainly concerned with his own
internal struggle for liberation and peace.
