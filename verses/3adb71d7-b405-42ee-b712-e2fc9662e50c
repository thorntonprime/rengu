There cannot be a sense of abundance or the experience of prosperity without
appreciation. You cannot find beauty unless you appreciate beauty. You cannot
find friendship unless you appreciate others. You cannot find love unless
you appreciate loving and being loved. If you wish abundance, appreciate life.
