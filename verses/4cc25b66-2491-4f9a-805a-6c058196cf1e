Hu Tzu said, "I have already showed you all the outward forms, but I
haven't yet showed you the substance-and do you really think you have
mastered this Way of mine? There may be a flock of hens but, if there
is no rooster, how can they lay fertile eggs? You take what you know of
the Way and wave it in the face of the world, expecting to be believed!
This is the reason men can see right through you. Try bringing your
shaman along next time and letting him get a look at me."
