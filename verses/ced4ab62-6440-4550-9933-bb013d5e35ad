What could man have to do with the perfection of God as the rule of his life,
unless the truth and reality of the divine nature was in him? Could there
be any reasonableness in this precept or any fitness to call us to be good,
as God is good, unless there was that in us which is in God? Or to call us
to the perfection of a heavenly Father if we were not the real children of
His heavenly nature? Might it not be as well to bid the heavy stone to fly
as its flying father, the eagle, doth?
