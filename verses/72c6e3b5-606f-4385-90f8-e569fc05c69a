Almighty God is found out by clear thought, when, the corruption of
our mortality being once for all trodden underfoot. He is seen by us,
taken up (into heaven) in the Brightness of His Divinity. ... For the
mind, whether of angels or men.  while it gazes toward the
unencompassed Light, shrinks into little by the mere fact that it is a
creature.
