Ch'ang Chi asked Confucius, "This Wang T'ai who's lost a foot - how
does he get to divide up Lu with you, Master, and make half of it his
disciples? He doesn't stand up and teach, he doesn't sit down and
discuss, yet they go to him empty and come home full. Does he really
have some wordless teaching, some formless way of bringing the mind to
completion? What sort of man is he?"
