As Napoleon and his retinue were riding on ground so littered with corpses
that it was impossible to avoid stepping on them, one of the horses trod
on a dying soldier and drew a last moan of pain from him. The Emperor,
until then as silent as his victory, terribly depressed by the sight of
so many victims, suddenly exploded and relieved his feelings by cries of
indignation and an exaggerated solicitude for the poor soldier. Someone,
to appease him, remarked that after all it was only a Russian. To which
Napoleon replied, “There are no enemies after a victory, but only men!”
Then he scattered the officers who were following him over the field to
succor the wounded whose cries could be heard on all sides.
