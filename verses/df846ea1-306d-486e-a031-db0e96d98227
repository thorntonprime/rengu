Title: What Madness Is Austerity
---
What madness is austerity in the rose season! When the sky meadow
blooms so should we. And in winter, why can't the warmth of any summer
day still be on our faces, that another can feel.

You have tied heaven's hands behind her back and veiled her face,
otherwise her lips you would know any hour you desired.

Write a little note to yourself about when your heart was most alive.
Carry that with you for a fortnight;

some tiny transference of love could happen to all you near, when your
memory touches what was once sacred to you.

Anything good in your past is a harbinger of what is to come in
greater quantities. Some words of Saadi come to mind about this -- why
should they not when he was such an influence upon me.

He helped me grow from child to man; he helped my arms embrace others
more deeply. He increased my pen's abilities every time I bowed and
sang at his tomb.

"Whatever beauty you have known, darling, you will know a thousand
times more."

Whatever beauty you have known, you will know a thousand times more.
