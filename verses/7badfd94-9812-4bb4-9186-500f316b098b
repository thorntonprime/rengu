When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten
 will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and
 there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of
 death, and these also number three in ten.
Why is this so? Because they set too much store by life.
I have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does
 not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he
 touched by weapons when charging into an army.
There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;
There is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;
There is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.
Why is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.
