Title: ALl or Nothing
---
Only in the all of the Spirit are
we able to open ourselves to

the one great work, which is to
let go of everything, even love,

so in our emptiness we might
have room enough, possessing

nothing -- neither virtue nor vice
nor love itself nor its absence --

and so finding You.
