Title: That Needs to Be Reckoned With
---
This is how the poems sometimes goï¼š One kiss leads to another.
Maybe I should translate that ... a few words of a line appear, and before
 that line is finished
they have already given birth. That was quick! What happened to any gestation
 period?
Yes, sometimes before one poem stops roughing me up, I discover
there is a whole litter hiding within one phrase that needs to be reckoned
 with.
