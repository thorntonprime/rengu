First Clown：

  A pick axe, and a spade, a spade.

    For and a shrouding sheet;

  O! a pit of clay for to be made

    For such a guest is meet.

  (Throws up another skull.)

Hamlet： There’s another; why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and
his tricks?  Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about
the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of
battery? Hum! This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land,
with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries; is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his
recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers
vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the
length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyance of his
lands will hardly lie in this box, and must the inheritor himself have
no more, ha?
