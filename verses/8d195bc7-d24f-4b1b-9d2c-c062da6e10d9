Many are the means described for the attainment of the highest good, such as
love, performance of duty, self-control, truthfulness, sacrifices, gifts,
austerity, charity, vows, observance of moral precepts. I could name more. But
of all I could name, verily love is the highestï¼š love and devotion that make
one forgetful of everything else, love that unites the lover with me. What
ineffable joy does one find through love of me, the blissful Self! Once that
joy is realized, all earthly pleasures fade into nothingness.
