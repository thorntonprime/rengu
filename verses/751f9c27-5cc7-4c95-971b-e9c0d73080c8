Title: Psalm Sixty Two
---
For You alone my soul waits in silence
    from you comes my salvation
You alone are my rock and my salvation, my fortress
    I shall never be shaken

For you alone my soul waits in silence
    for my hope is from you
On you rests my deliverance and my honor,
    my mighty rock, my refuge is in you
I trust in you at all times,
    I pour out my heart before you
    you are a refuge for me

Once you have spoken
    twice I have heard that power belongs to you
And steadfast love belongs to you
    you repay all according to their work
