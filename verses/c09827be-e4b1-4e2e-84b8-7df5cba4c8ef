Men think much of their own advancement and of many other worldly things; but
there is no improvement in this decaying world, which is as a tempting dish,
sweet-coated, yet full of deadly gall within.

It is as an extinguished lamp, whose flame is lost, fled we know not where.
It is as intangible as a mist; try to lay hold of it. and it proves to be
nothing!
