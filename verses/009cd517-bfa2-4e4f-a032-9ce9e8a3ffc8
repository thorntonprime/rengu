  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=Beauty and Knowledge
By: Plotinus
---
We hold that all the loveliness of this world comes by communion in Ideal Form.
All shapelessness whose kind admits of pattern and of form, as long as it
remains outside of Reason and Idea, and has not been entirely mastered by
Reason, the matter not yielding at all points and in all respects to Ideal
Form, is ugly by that very isolation from the Divine Thought. But where the
Ideal Form has entered, it has grouped and co-ordinated what from a diversity
of parts was to become a unity; it has rallied confusion into co-operation; it
has made the sum one harmonious coherence; for the Idea is a unity and what it
moulds must come to unity as far as multiplicity may. And on what has thus been
compacted to unity. Beauty enthrones itself, giving itself to the parts as to
the sum.

This, then, is how the material thing becomes beautiful -- by communicating in
the thought that flows from the Divine.
