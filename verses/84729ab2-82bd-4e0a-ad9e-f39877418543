Title: You
---
Why smile when you look at me?
I want to see your frowning face.
I don’t want to frown at you, though.
You wouldn’t want to see it.
When the falling peach blossoms grazed your lips,
I cried, not knowing that my brow was creasing.
And so I hid my face with a gold-embroidered handkerchief.
