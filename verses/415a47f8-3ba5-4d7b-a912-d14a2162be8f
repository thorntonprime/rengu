The principle which guided him [Montaigne] in his administration was to
look only at the fact, at the result, and to grant nothing to noice and
outward show： “How much more a good effect makes a noise, so much I
abate of the goodness of it.” For it is always to be feared that it was
more performed for the sake of noise than upon the account of goodness：
“Being exposed upon the stall, 'tis half sold." That was not Montaigne’s
way; he made no show： he employed in a manner useful to all alike gifts
of sincerity and conciliation; the personal attraction with which nature
endowed him was a quality of the highest value in the management of men. He
preferred to warn men of evil rather than to take on himself the honor of
repressing it： “Is there any one who desires to be sick that he may
see his physician’s practice? And would not that physician deserve to
be whipped who should wish the plague among us that he might put his art
into practice?”
