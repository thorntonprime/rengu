In my eternal mode of birth I have always been, am now, and shall eternally
remain.  That which I am in time shall die and come to naught, for it is
of the day and passes with the day. In my birth all things were born, and I
was the cause of mine own self and all things, and had I willed it had never
been, nor any thing, and if I had not been then God had not been either. To
understand this is not necessary.
