It is related in the stories that John (the Baptist) and Jesus (Peace be upon
them!) were walking in the market when a woman knocked against them. Then John
said. ‘I am not cognisant of that.’ Jesus said, ‘Praise be to God! Your
body is with me, but where is your heart?’ He replied, ‘O cousin, if my
heart found rest in something other than God for the twinkling of an eye,
I should think that I had not known God.'
