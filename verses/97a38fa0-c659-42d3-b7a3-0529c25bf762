Who travels well leaves no trace.
Who speaks well leaves no discord.
Who reckons well leaves no tally.

Who secures well uses neither board nor lock,
yet what he closes, no one can open.
Who binds well uses neither cord nor knot,
yet what he binds, no one can undo.

Who follows the Way well
leaves none untended,
leaves none behind,
leaves naught to waste.
Such is listening to the light within.

Good men are to bad men teachers.
Bad men are to good men responsibilities.
Who does not respect his teacher—
or his responsibility—
whatever else he knows,
wants wisdom.
Such is the subtle essence.
