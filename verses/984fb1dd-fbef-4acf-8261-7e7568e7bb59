The knight of faith knows ... that it is beautiful and salutary to be the
individual who translates himself into the universal, who edits, as it were,
a pure and elegant edition of himself, as free from errors as possible and
which everyone can read. ... But he knows also that higher than this there
winds a solitary path, narrow and steep; he knows that it is terrible to be
born outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler. ... The
knight of faith knows that to give up oneself for the universal inspires
enthusiasm, and that it requires courage, but he also knows that security
is to be found in this precisely because it is for the universal. ... The
hero does the deed and finds repose in the universal, the knight of faith
is kept in constant tension.
