    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: The Future Enters Us
---
It seems to me that all our sadnesses are moments of tension that we
feel as paralysis because we can no longer experience our banished
feelings. Because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has
entered us, because we feel momentarily abandoned by what we've
believed and grown accustomed to; because we can't keep standing as
the ground shifts under our feet. That is why the sadness passes over
like a wave. The new presence inside us, that which has come to us,
has entered our heart, has found its way to its innermost chamber, and
is no longer even there—it is already in our blood. And we don't know
what it was. We could easily be persuaded that nothing happened, and
yet something has changed inside us, as a house changes when a guest
comes into it. We cannot say who has entered, we may never know, but
there are many indications that the future enters us in just this way,
to transform itself within us long before it happens. That is why it
is so important to be alone and attentive when you are sad： because
the seemingly uneventful and motionless moment when our future steps
into us is so much closer to life than any loud and accidental point
of time which occurs, as it were, from the outside.
