    Definition: Essence of the Saddharma-pundarika, q.v.. as summed up in the

It is better for men to set their gaze on the Law Blossom1 than to study, no

gaze on the real Law Blossom than to build towers to contain inexhaustible

to set up a million images of the Buddha. It is better for men to set their
gaze on the real Law Blossom than to study all the mysteries of the'three
worlds. ... To sum up -- there is nothing which surpasses the repeating of
the sacred formula, providing that all attachment to things is cut off.
