Title: The Night of Orchard
Description: June 21
---
The night orchard is in bloom, the clear sky. How many people have looked upon
 her face and called her by different names?
Still she responds as if there is something so personal just between you and
 her.
Does not she even appear to be willing to become intimate with your ways? Who
 taught those sweet manners?
About the heart, what can I say? Complaints I have known vanished.
It was bound to happen, with all the best that one might believe of God ...
 will come true. And more.
