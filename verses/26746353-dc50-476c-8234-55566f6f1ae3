You will not grow if you sit in a beautiful flower garden, but you will
grow if you are sick, if you are in pain, if you experience losses, and if
you do not put your head in the sand, but take the pain and learn to accept
it, not as a curse or punishment, but as a gift to you with a very, very
specific purpose.
