You must descend from your head to your heart. At present your thoughts of
God are in your head. And God Himself is, as it were, outside you, and so
your prayer and other spiritual exercises remain exterior. Whilst you are
still in your head, thoughts will not easily be subdued but will always be
whirling about, like snow in winter or clouds of mosquitoes in the summer.
