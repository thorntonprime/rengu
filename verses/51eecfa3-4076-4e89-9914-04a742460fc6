Title: I Might Have Seen an Abduction
Description: August 28
---
I think this is just what we need to test our relationship, to see how loyal
 you really are to me. So let’s talk ... flying saucers,
and maybe I will even hint at an abduction I might have witnessed, just
 three nights ago.
They might have gotten you. Are any classic symptoms showing, like
daydreaming at the wheel and playing with yourself as you fantasize about
 supernatural things?
I hope you are not looking for a cheap way to fame by saying you made love
 with an alien.
I did catch one once, in a butterfly net, a UFO, but thought it best to turn
 it loose before some
undercover police showed up and thought I was the ring leader of some ...
 exotic coup d’état.
