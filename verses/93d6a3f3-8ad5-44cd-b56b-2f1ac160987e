The devil is no fool. He can get people feeling about heaven the way they
ought to feel about hell. He can make them fear the means ofgrace the way
they do not fear sin. And he does so, not by light but by obscurity, not
by realities but by shadows; not by clarity and substance, but by dreams
and the creatures of psychosis.
