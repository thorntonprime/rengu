---
Wouldst thou come with me to the wine-cellar
That will cost thee much;
Even hadst thou a thousand marks
It were all spent in one hour!
If thou wouldst drink the unmingled wine
Thou must ever spend more than thou hast,
And the host will never fill thy glass to the brim!
Thou wilt become poor and naked,
Despised of all who would rather see themselves
In the dust, than squander their all in the wine-cellar.
