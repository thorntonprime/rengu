Title: All things Desire
---
All things desire to be like God,
and infinite space is a mirror
that tries
to reflect His
body.

But it can't.
All that infinite existence can show us of Him
is only an atom of God's
being.

God stood behind Himself one night and cast a
brilliant shadow from which creation
came.

Even this shadow is such a flame that
moths consume their selves in it every second --
with their sacred passion to possess
beautiful
forms.

Existence mirrors God the best it can,
though how arrogant for any image in that mirror,
for any human being, to
think they know
His will;

for His will has never been spoken,
His voice would ignite
the earth's wings

and all upon
it.

We invent truths about God to protect ourselves
from the wolf's cries we hear
and make.


All things desire to be like God,
all things desire to
love.
