Title: Walking Heaven's Ground
---
Heavenliness -- again. For instance, walking up into the woods yesterday
afternoon -- as if my feet acquired a heavenly lightness from contact
with the earth of the path. As though the earth itself were filled with
an indescribable spirituality and lightness, as if the true nature of the
earth were to be heavenly, or rather as if all things, in truth, had a
heavenly existence. As if existence itself was heavenliness. The same --
at Mass, obviously. But with a new earthy and yet pure heavenliness of
bread. The ikons, particularly of St. Elias and his great red globe of
light, and the desert gold, the bird red on the mountainï¼š all transformed!
