\"A good cook changes his knife once a year-because he cuts. A mediocre
cook changes his knife once a month-because he hacks. I've had this
knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with
it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the
grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the
knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into
such spaces, then there's plenty of room - more than enough for the
blade to play about it. That's why after nineteen years the blade of my
knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.
