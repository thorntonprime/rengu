The inner creation is holy, and the outer creation, which is in the vital flux,
would likewise be so had the curse not penetrated therein through the awakening
of vanity. Nevertheless, if it is possible to dissociate vanity from the vital
flux, this itself is holy and represents a Paradise, as will appear at the end
of this world.
