Title: The Irrelevant Middle Ages?
---
I wonder if I have not said ill -- considered things about Christian
traditions -- things that will only add to the present confusion,
motivated by some obscure desire to protect my own heart against wounds
by inflicting them myself (i, e., the wounds ofloss and separation： as
if I were saying, since the Middle Ages are no longer relevant to us, I
might as well be the first to admit it and get it over with. But are the
Middle Ages irrelevant? Of course not, and I have not begun to believe
it! And it is part of my vocation to make observations that preserve a
living continuity with the past, and with what is good in the past!).

The study of medieval exegesis is a way of entering into the Christian
experience of that age, an experience most relevant to us, for if we neglect
it, we neglect part of our own totality in Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von
Balthasar, etc. But it must not be studied from the outside. Same idea
in Kitaro Nishida on Japanese culture and the japanese view of life. I
have a real sense this Easter that my own vocation demands a deepened
and experiential study, from within (by connaturality), of the medieval
tradition as well as of, to some extent, Asian tradition and experiences,
particularly Japanese, particularly Zen： i, e., in an awareness of a
common need and aspiration with these past generations.
