For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God. ...

Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of
days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest
continually.

Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave
the tenth of the spoils.
