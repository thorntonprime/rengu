The ritual acts of man are an answer and reaction to the action of God
upon man; and perhaps they are not only that, but are also intended to
be “activating,“ a form of magic coercion. That man feels capable
of formulating valid replies to the overpowering influence of God, and
that he can render back something which is essential even to God, induces
pride, for it raises the human individual to the dignity of a metaphysical
factor. “God and us” -- even ifit is only an unconscious sous-entendu --
this equation no doubt underlies that enviable serenity of the Pueblo
Indian. Such a man is in the fullest sense of the word in his proper place.
