In the world everyone knows enough to pursue what he does not know, but
no one knows enough to pursue what he already knows. Everyone knows
enough to condemn what he takes to be no good, but no one knows enough
to condemn what he has already taken to be good. This is how the
great confusion comes about, blotting out the brightness of sun and
moon above, searing the vigor of hills and streams below, overturning
the round of the four seasons in between. There is no insect that
creeps and crawls, no creature that flutters and flies that has not
lost its inborn nature. So great is the confusion of the world that
comes from coveting knowledge!
