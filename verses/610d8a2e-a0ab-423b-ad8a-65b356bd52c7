The true earth is pure and situated in the pure heaven. ... But we who live in
these hollows are deceived into the notion that we are dwelling above on the
surface of the earth; which is just as if a creature who was at the bottom of
the sea were to fancy that he was on the surface of the water, and that the sea
was the heaven. ... If any man could arrive at the exterior limit, or take the
wings of a bird and come to the top, then like a fish who puts his head out of
the water and sees this world, he would see a world beyond; and, if the nature
of man could sustain the sight, he would acknowledge that this other world was
the place of the true heaven and the true light and the true earth.
