Some Alchemists fancy that the work from beginning to end is a mere
idle entertainment; but those who make it so will reap what they have
sown -- viz., nothing.  We know that next to the Divine Blessing, and
the discovery of the proper foundation, nothing is so important as
unwearied industry and perseverance in this First Operation. It is no
wonder.  then, that so many students of this Art are reduced to
beggary; they are afraid of work, and look upon our Art as mere sport
for their leisure moments. For no labour is more tedious than that
which the preparatory part of our enterprise demands. Morienus
earnestly entreats the King to consider this fact, and says that many
Sages have complained of the tedium of our work. ‘To render a chaotic
mass orderly.’ says the Poet, ‘is matter of much time and labour’ --
and the noble author of the Hermetical Arcanum describes it as an
Herculean task.
