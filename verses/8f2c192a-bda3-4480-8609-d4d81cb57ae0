If we possess God in the immersion of love -- that is, if we are lost to
ourselves -- God is our own and we are His ownï¼š and we sink ourselves
eternally and irretrievably in our own possession, which is God. ... And this
down-sinking is like a river, which without pause or turning back ever pours
into the sea; since this is its proper resting-place.
