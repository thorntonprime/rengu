Title: Yunmen's Medicine and Disease

Raised：

Yunmen said in teaching the assembly, "'Medicine and
disease cure each other.' The entire great earth is medicine. What
particularly is oneself?

"Cure."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

"The entire great Earth is Medicine."

From ancient times to the present, how extremely wrong!

Don't make the cart behind closed doors.

The path through is naturally desolate and empty.

Wrong. Wrong.

Yet, nostrils as far as heaven are also pierced.
