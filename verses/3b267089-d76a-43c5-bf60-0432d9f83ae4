Do not now say. that you have this one will and one hunger and yet
find not the food of life by it. For as sure as you are forced to
complain, so sure is it that you have it not. ...  For Godâ€™s kingdom
must manifest itself with all its riches in that soul which wills
nothing else; it never was nor can be lost but by the will that seeks
something else.
