Title: Sophia in Egypt
---
And long I lay in `troubled sleep,
Then a whisper： “Rest, friend, rest.”
And I slept; and later gently roused --
Earth and sky, the whole world smelled of roses!

Agown in heavenly purple glow you stood,
Eyes full of azure fire,
Your glance was the first blaze
Of world-filling, life-giving day.

What is, what was, what shall forever be --
All, all was held here in one steady gaze ...
The seas and rivers blue beneath me,
Distant woods, snow-capped peaks.

I saw all, and all was one --
A single image of womanly beauty ...
Pregnant with vastnesses!
Before me, in me -- only You.
