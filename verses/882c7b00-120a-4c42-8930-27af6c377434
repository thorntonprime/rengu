Our own death is indeed unimaginable, and whenever we make the
attempt to imagine it we can perceive that we really survive as
spectators. Hence. ... at the bottom no one believes in his own death,
or to put the same thing in another way, in the consciousness every one
of us is convinced of his own immortality.
