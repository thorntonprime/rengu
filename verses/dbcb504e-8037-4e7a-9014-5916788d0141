  Title: Prajnaparamita
---
Empty and calm and devoid of self
is the nature of all things.
No individual being
in reality exists.

There is no end or beginning,
nor middle course.
All is illusion,
as in a vision or dream.

All beings in the world
are beyond the realm of words.
Their ultimate nature, pure and true,
is like the infinity of space.
