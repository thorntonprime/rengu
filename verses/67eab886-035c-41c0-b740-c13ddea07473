Subhuti was Buddha's disciple. He was able to understand the
potency of emptiness, the viewpoint that nothing exists except
in its relationship of subjectivity and objectivity.

One day Subhuti, in a mood of sublime emptiness, was sitting
under a tree. Flowers began to fall about him.

"We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness," the gods
whispered to him.

"But I have not spoken of emptiness," said Subhuti.

"You have not spoken of emptiness, we ahve not heard emptiness,"
responded the gods. "This is the true emptiness." And blossoms
showered upon Subhuti as rain.
