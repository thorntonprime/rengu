Great is the grace of His promise, 'if to-day we hear His voice'; and
this 'to-day' is extended day by day, so long as the word 'to-day'
exists. Both the 'to-day' and the teaching continue until the consummation
of all things; and then the true 'to-day', the unending day of God,
reaches on throughout the ages.

Let us, then, ever listen to the voice of the divine Word. For 'to-day'
is an image of the everlasting age, and the day is a symbol of light, and
the light of men is the Word, through whom we gaze upon God.
