There is an indefinable mysterious Power that pervades everything. I feel it
though I do not see it. It is this unseen Power which makes itself felt and
yet defies all proof, because it is so unlike all that I perceive through
my senses. It transcends the senses. But it is possible to reason out the
existence of God to a limited extent.
