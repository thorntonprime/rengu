Chu Ch'ueh-tzu said to Chang Wu-tzu, "I have heard Confucius say that
the sage does not work at anything, does not pursue profit, does not
dodge harm, does not enjoy being sought after, does not follow the Way,
says nothing yet says something, says something yet says nothing, and
wanders beyond the dust and grime. Confucius himself regarded these as
wild and flippant words, though I believe they describe the working of
the mysterious Way. What do you think of them?"
