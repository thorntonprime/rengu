\"Goodness, how could that do? You may put on a fine outward show and
seem very impressive, but you can't avoid having an uncertain look on
your face, any more than an ordinary man can. And then you try to
gauge this man's feelings and seek to influence his mind. But with him,
what is called 'the virtue that advances a little each day' would not
succeed, much less a great display of virtue! He will stick fast to his
position and never be converted. Though he may make outward signs of
agreement, inwardly he will not give it a thought! How could such an
approach succeed?"
