Title: Widening Circles
---
I live my life in widening circles
that reach out across the world.
I may not complete this last one
but I give myself to it.

I circle around God, around the primordial tower.
I've been circling for thousands of years
and I still don't knowï¼š am I a falcon,
a storm, or a great song.
