Confucius said to Lao Tan, "I have been studying the Six Classics - the
Odes, the Documents, the Ritual, the Music, the Changes, and the Spring
and Autumn, for what I would call a long time, and I know their
contents through and through. But I have been around to seventy-two
different rulers with them, expounding the ways of the former kings and
making clear the path trod by the dukes of Chou and Shao, and yet not a
single ruler has found anything to excite his interest. How difficult
it is to persuade others, how difficult to make clear the Way!"
