This man is known by five signs. First, he never complains. Next,
he never makes excuses; when accused, he leaves the facts to vindicate
him. Thirdly, there is nothing he wants in earth or heaven but what God wills
himself. Fourthly, he is not moved in time. Fifthly, he is never rejoiced;
he is joy itself.
