One who travels does so in order to open his ears and eyes and relax his
spirit. He explores the Nine States and travels over the Eight Barbarian
Countries, in the hope that he may gather the Divine Essence and meet
great Taoists, and that he may eat of the plant of eternal life and find
the marrow of rocks. Riding upon the wind and sailing upon ether, he goes
coolly whithersoever the wind may carry him.
