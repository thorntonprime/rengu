Title: Risking Unknowing
---
How should I prepare to find You?
In emptying myself of the chatter

of my words, and opening myself
to the silence that allows me

to risk an unknowing that expects
nothing and deserves nothing

and wills nothing other than
the word You speak in

the stillness I keep where
my wandering ceases and

my wondering begins?
