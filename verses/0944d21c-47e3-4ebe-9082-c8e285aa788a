Title: Wilder than We Ever
---
The one who pours is wilder than we ever become drinking,
wilder than wine, the one who fills to the brim
and leaves to live in absence with a toast,
Go home. There is nothing for you here.

A pearl in the shell does not touch the ocean.
Be a pearl without a shell, a mindful flooding,
candle turned moth, head become empty jar,
bird settling nest, love lived.
