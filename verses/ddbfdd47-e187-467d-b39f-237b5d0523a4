For one moment sink into the ocean of God, and do not suppose that one hair of
your head shall be moistened by the water of the seven seas. If the vision you
behold is the Face of God, there is no doubt that from this time forward you
will see clearly. When the foundations of your own existence arc destroyed,
have no fear in your heart that you yourself will perish.
