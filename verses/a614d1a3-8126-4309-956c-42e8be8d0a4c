Title: Castrating an Ego
---
The only problem with not castrating a gigantic ego is that it
will surely become amorous and father a hundred screaming ideas and kids
who will then all quickly grow up and skillfully proceed to run up
every imaginable debt and complication of which your brain can conceive.
This would concern normal parents and any seekers of freedom
and the local merchants nearby as well.
They could very easily become forced to disturb your peace;
all those worries and bills could turn to wailing ghosts.
The only problem with not lassoing a runaway ego is
you wonâ€™t have much desire to play in this sweet world.
