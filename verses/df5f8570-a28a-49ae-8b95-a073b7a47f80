Title: Raw Silk and Uncut Wood
Commentary: |
  This chapter and the two before it may be read as a single movement of
  thought.

  “Raw silk” and “uncut wood” are images traditionally associated with
  the characters su (simple, plain) and p’u (natural, honest).

Stop being holy, forget being prudent,
it’ll be a hundred times better for everyone.
Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous,
people will remember what family feeling is.
Stop planning, forget making a profit,
there won’t be any thieves and robbers.

But even these three rules
needn’t be followed; what works reliably
is to know the raw silk,
hold the uncut wood.
Need little,
want less.
Forget the rules.
Be untroubled.
