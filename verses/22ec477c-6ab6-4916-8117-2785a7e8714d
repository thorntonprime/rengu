Once Chuang Tzu dreamt he was a butterfly,
a butterfly flitting and fluttering around,
happy with himself and doing as he pleased.

He didn't know he was Chuang Tzu.

Suddenly he woke up and there he was,
solid and unmistakable Chuang Tzu.
But he didn't know if he was Chuang Tzu who had dreamt he was a butterfly,
or a butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Tzu.

Between Chuang Tzu and a butterfly there must be some distinction!
This is called the Transformation of Things.
