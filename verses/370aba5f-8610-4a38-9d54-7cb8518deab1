    Title: Approaches to God
By: Jacques Maritain

To know God in His essence is evidently something which transcends the powers
of every created or creatable nature, for it is to possess God intuitively,
in a vision in which there is no mediation of any idea, but in which the
divine essence itself replaces every idea born in our mind, so that it
immediately forms and determines our intellect. This is to know God divinely,
as He Himself knows Himself and as He knows us, in His own uncreated light.

Nothing is more human that for man to desire naturally things impossible to
his nature. It is, indeed, the property ofa nature which is not closed up
in matter like the nature of physical things, but which is intellectual or
infinitized by the spirit. It is the property of a metaphysical nature. Such
desires reach for the infinite, because the intellect thirsts for being and
being is infinite.
