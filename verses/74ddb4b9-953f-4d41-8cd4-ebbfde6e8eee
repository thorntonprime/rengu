Campanella teacheth us. That all second Causes, are Causa prima modificata, so
many Modifications of the first Cause, so many forms and shapes in which the
first Cause appears and acts. All the Works of God, are the Divine Love, in so
many Modes and Dresses. There is diversity of Manifestations, there are
diversities of Operations, which compose the whole frame and business of this
Creation, which are as diverse persons acting diverse parts upon this stage.
But there is one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one Love, which worketh all in all.
