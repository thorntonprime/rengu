There is nothing that stands fast, nothing fixed, nothing free from change,
among the things which come into being, neither among those in heaven nor among
those on earth. God alone stands unmoved, and with good reason; for he is
self-contained, and self-derived, and wholly self-centred, and in him is no
deficiency or imperfection. He stands fast in virtue of his own immobility, nor
can he be moved by any force impinging on him from without, seeing that in him
are all things, and that it is he alone that is in all things.
