The Lord in His infinite mercy is ever anxious that we must offer our mind to
Him and is very eagerly awaiting our doing so. If, therefore, we do offer our
mind to Him, it is clear that He will be immensely pleased. Our mind ... is
something which is dear to Him. which He has not with Him. and which He longs
to have. If we give it to Him, there can be no doubt that He will be made happy
and that, as a consequence, happiness will be reflected in us also.
