The nyoi is used in various ways by Zen teachers to challenge their
students. Master Torei asks. “What is this?“ I would add to the
complications by saying, if you have a nyoi, I‘ll give you one,
if you don't have a nyoi, I will take it away. If you call it a nyoi,
you’re ten thousand miles from the truth. If you say its not a nyoi,
you miss it completely. What will you call it?
