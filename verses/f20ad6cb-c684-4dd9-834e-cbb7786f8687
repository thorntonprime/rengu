Is your voice silence?
When you’re not singing, I hear your song’s melody clearly.
Your voice is silence.

Is your face darkness?
When I close my eyes, I see your face distinctly.
Your face is darkness.

Is your shadow light?
When the moon sets, your shadow shines on the dark window.
Your shadow is light.
