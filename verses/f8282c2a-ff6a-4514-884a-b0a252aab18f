Title: When a Dog Runs Up
---
Start seeing everything as God, but keep it a secret.
Become like the man and woman who are awestruck and nourished
listening to a golden nightingale sing in a beautiful foreign language while
 God, invisible to most, nests upon its tongue.
Hafiz, who can you tell in this world that when a dog runs up to you wagging
 its ecstatic tail, you lean over and whisper in its ear,
"Beloved, I am so glad you are happy to see me! Beloved, I am so glad,
 so very glad you have come!"
