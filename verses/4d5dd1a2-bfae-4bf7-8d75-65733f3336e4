\"To travel across the water without shrinking from the sea serpent or
the dragon - this is the courage of the fisherman. To travel over land
without shrinking from the rhinoceros or the tiger - this is the
courage of the hunter. To see the bare blades clashing before him and
to look upon death as though it were life - this is the courage of the
man of ardor. To understand that hardship is a matter of fate, that
success is a matter of the times, and to face great difficulty without
fear - this is the courage of the sage. Be content with it, Tzu Lu. My
fate has been decided for me."
