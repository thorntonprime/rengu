When I was preparing the substance, after discovering the true method,
I was so seriously interfered with by the persons with whom I lived
that I was almost on the point of giving up the whole thing in
despair. At length I communicated my discovery to a friend, who
faithfully executed my instructions, and brought the work to a
successful issue. For which Blessed Gift may God be praised, world
without end.
