Title: Webbed Toes
---
The man with two toes webbed together would weep if he tried to tear
them apart; the man with a sixth finger on his hand would howl if he
tried to gnaw it off. Of these two, one has more than the usual number,
the other has less, but in worrying about it they are identical.
Nowadays the benevolent men of the age lift up weary eyes, worrying
over the ills of the world, while the men of no benevolence tear apart
the original form of their inborn nature in their greed for eminence
and wealth. Therefore I wonder if benevolence and righteousness are
really part of man's true form? From the Three Dynasties on down,
what a lot of fuss and hubbub they have made in the world!
