The Platonist Plotinus discourses on Providence and from the beauty of flower
and foliage proves that from the supreme God, whose beauty is unseen and
ineffable, Providence reaches down even to these earthly things below; all of
which things, so transitory and momentary, could not have their peculiar,
richly assorted beauties, but from that intellectual and immutable Beauty
forming them all.
