What is needed is absorption in God -- loving Him intensely. The ‘Nectar Lake’
is the Lake of Immortality. A man sinking in It does not die, but becomes
immortal. Some people believe that by thinking of God too much the mind becomes
deranged; but that is not true. God is the Lake of Nectar, the Ocean of
Immortality. He is called the ‘Immortal’ in the Vedas. Sinking in It, one does
not die, but verily transcends death.
