  - Name: Nitâi
    Description: Nityânanda. a close disciple of Chaitanya, q.v.
---
Nitâi would employ any means to make people repeat Hari’s name. Chaitanya
said： ‘The name of God has very great sanctity. It may not produce an
immediate result, but one day it must bear fruit. It is like a seed that has
been left on the cornice of a building. After many days the house crumbles,
and the seed falls on the earth, germinates, and at last bears fruit.'
