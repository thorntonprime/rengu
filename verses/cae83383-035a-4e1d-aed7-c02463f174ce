  - Invocation=The Glory of the Name
By: St Thomas Aquinas
---
St Paul bore the Name of Jesus on his forehead because he gloried in
proclaiming it to all men, he bore it on his lips because he loved to invoke
it, on his hands for he loved to write it in his epistles, in his heart for
his heart burned with love of it.
