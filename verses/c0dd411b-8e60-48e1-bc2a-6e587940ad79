Title: Refuge
By: Buddha
---
They go to many a refuge,
    to mountains, forests,
    parks, trees, and shrines：
people threatened with danger.
That's not the secure refuge,
that's not the highest refuge,
that's not the refuge,
having gone to which,
    you gain release
    from all suffering and stress.

But when, having gone for refuge
to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha,
you see with right discernment
the four Noble Truths --
    stress,
    the cause of stress,
    the transcending of stress,
    and the Noble Eightfold Path,
    the way to the stilling of stress：
That's the secure refuge,
that, the highest refuge,
that is the refuge,
having gone to which,
    you gain release
    from all suffering and stress.
