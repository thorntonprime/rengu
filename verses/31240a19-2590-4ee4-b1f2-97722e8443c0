I acknowledge and confess that thou (Mother Nature) art the Mother and Empress
of the great world, made for the little world of man’s mind. Thou movest the
bodies above, and transmutest the elements below. At the bidding of thy Lord
thou dost accomplish both small things and great, and renewest, by ceaseless
decay and generation, the face of the earth and of the heavens. ... All that
exists and is endued with being flows forth from thee by virtue of the power
that God has given to thee. All matter is ruled by thee, and the elements are
under thy governance. From them thou takest the first substance, and from the
heavens thou dost obtain the form. That substance is formless and void until it
is modified and individualized by thee. First thou givest it a substantial, and
then an individual form.
