The Supreme Intelligence dances in the soul ... for the purpose of removing our
sins. By these means, our Father scatters the darkness of illusion (maya),
burns the thread of causality (karma), stamps down evil (mala, anava, avidya),
showers Grace, and lovingly plunges the soul in the ocean of Bliss (ananda).
They never see rebirths, who behold this mystic dance.
