Hsi-wei got it and held up heaven and earth. Fu Hsi got it and
entered into the mother of breath. The Big Dipper got it and from
ancient times has never wavered. The Sun and Moon got it and from
ancient times have never rested. K'an-p'i got it and entered K'un-lun.
Ping-i got it and wandered in the great river. Chien Wu got it and
lived in the great mountain. The Yellow Emperor got it and ascended
to the cloudy heavens. Chuan Hsu got it and dwelt in the Dark Palace.
Yu-ch'iang got it and stood at the limit of the north. The Queen Mother
of the West got it and took her seat on Shaokuang - nobody knows her
beginning, nobody knows her end. P'eng-tsu got it and lived from the
age of Shun to the age of the Five Dictators. Fu Yueh got it and
became minister to Wu-ting, who extended his rule over the whole world;
then Fu Yueh climbed up to the Eastern Governor, straddled the
Winnowing Basket and the Tail, and took his place among the ranks of
stars.
