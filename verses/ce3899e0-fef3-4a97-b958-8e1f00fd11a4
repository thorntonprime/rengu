Issuing from the north of the Old City (Patna in Central India) and
going down for three li to the east, there is Dêvadatta's rock cave：
and fifty paces from this, there is a large square black rock.
Formerly, a religious mendicant, pacing backwards and forwards on it,
reflected as follows：  -- ‘This body of mine suffers the bitterness of
impermanency; in vain do I attain to an outlook which is not impure. I
loathe this body!' Thereupon he seized a knife, meaning to kill
himself; but once more he reflected： 'The World-Honoured One has set
his canon against self-slaughter.’ Then he further reflected：
'Although this is so, I now only desire to slay three baneful
thieves,  -- lust, hate, and ignorance.’ He then took the knife and cut
his throat. At the beginning of the cut he became a Srotâpanna; when
half through, an Anâgâmin; and when quite through he became an Arhat,
and attained to pari-nirvâna (and died).
