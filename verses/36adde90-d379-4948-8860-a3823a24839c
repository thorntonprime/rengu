Title: The Yes of Your Word
---
Let me learn to weave of the threads of my life
a fabric soft and warm and colorful enough

to wrap me with love as I long to be, and let me
find the courage to know that who I am

gives life to the always now and ever here of love,
and let me believe that it is enough to let the Yes

of Your Word rise to bursting life in me.
