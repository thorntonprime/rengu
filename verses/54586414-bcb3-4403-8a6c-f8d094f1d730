Death does not end all. Death does not mean total annihilation. Death does
not end the chain or sequence. The working agent, the Soul in the body,
does not and cannot die with the death of the body. Manâ€™s Soul is immortal.
Just as a person lays aside his overcoat, so also he lays aside the physical
body at death.
