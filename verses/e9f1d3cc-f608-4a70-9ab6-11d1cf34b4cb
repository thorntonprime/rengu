I should like first to inquire for a little what reason, what prudence,
there is in wishing to glory in the greatness and extent of the empire,
when you cannot point out the happiness of men who are always rolling,
with dark fear and cruel lust, in warlike slaughters and in blood, which,
whether shed in civil or foreign war, is still human blood; so that their joy
may be compared to glass in its fragile splendour, of which one is horribly
afraid lest it should be suddenly broken in pieces.
