O friend, I sit alone while the world sleeps.
In the palace that held love's pleasure the abandoned one sits.
She who once threaded a necklace of pearls is now stringing tears.
He has left me. The night passes while I count starts.
When will the Hour arrive?
This sorrow must end. Lifter of Mountains, please return.
