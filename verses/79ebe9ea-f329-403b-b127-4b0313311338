Though I am worse than a dog, you have graciously undertaken to
protect me. This delusion of birth and death is maintained by you.
Moreover, am I the person to sift and judge? Am I the Lord here? Oh
Mahesvara. It is for you to roll me through bodies (by births and
deaths) or to keep me fixed at your own feet.
