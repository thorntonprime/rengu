Title: Linji's Great Meaning
---
Upper-Seat Ding asked Linji, "So, what is the great meaning of the
Buddha Dharma?"

Ji got down from the meditation (Zen) bench and seized and held him and
gave a single slap, then held up his open palms.

Ding stood motionless.

A monk nearby said, "Upper-Seat Ding, why don't you bow ceremonially?"

Ding just then bowed ceremonially and suddenly had a great awakening.
