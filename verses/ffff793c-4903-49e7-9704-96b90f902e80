Always to me unknown may be
  Love that I seek and do not findï¼š
But though you flee, sweet fantasy,
  And I who follow lag behind,
Farther than any I shall run
After a fair illusion.

Yours is the tremulous touch I feel,
  O yours the beauty I enfold,
Conjuring lovers to reveal
  You whom I never may behold.
Yet will I follow -- while you flee
Always, O Love, away from me.
