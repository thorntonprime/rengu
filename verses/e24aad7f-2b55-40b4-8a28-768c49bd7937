  Title: The Soul is Here for Its Own Joy
Title: What I said to the wanting-creature
---
I said to the wanting-creature inside me：
What is this river you want to cross?
There are not travelers on the river-road, and no road.
Do you see anyone moving about on that bank, or resting?
There is no river at all, and no boat, and no boatman.
There is no towrope either, and no one to pull it.
There is no ground, no sky, no time, no bank, no ford!

And there is no body, and no mind!
Do you believe there is some place that will make the soul less thirsty?
In that great absence you will find nothing.

Be strong then, and enter into your own body;
there you have a solid place for your feet.
Think about it carefully!
Don't go off somewhere else!

Kabir says this：
Just throw away all thoughts of imaginary things,
and stand firm in that which you are.
