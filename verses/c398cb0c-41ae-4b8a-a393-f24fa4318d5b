Title: Underwater in the Fountain
---
When you die into the soul,
you lift the lid on the cooking pot.

You see the truth
of what you have been doing.

It looks terrible and sad
before the crossover move
that lets nine levels of ascension
turn into ordinary ground.

Into silence, a conversation with Khidr,
as there you are blind and deaf,
underwater in the fountain.
