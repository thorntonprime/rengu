\"Do you know what it is that destroys virtue, and where wisdom comes
from? Virtue is destroyed by fame, and wisdom comes out of wrangling.
Fame is something to beat people down with, and wisdom is a device for
wrangling. Both are evil weapons - not the sort of thing to bring you
success. Though your virtue may be great and your good faith
unassailable, if you do not understand men's spirits, though your fame
may be wide and you do not strive with others, if you do not understand
men's minds, but instead appear before a tyrant and force him to listen
to sermons on benevolence and righteousness, measures and standards -
this is simply using other men's bad points to parade your own
excellence. You will be called a plaguer of others. He who plagues
others will be plagued in turn. You will probably be plagued by this
man.
