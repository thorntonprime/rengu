As for me, my internal pace is slow. Mine is the intrinsic slowness of the tree
that embraces its growth and its blooming. Yes, I have a bit of its admirable

slowness that engenders and distills any work of art. But if I know its
temporal measure, I know nothing of its immobility. Oh, the joys of travel!
