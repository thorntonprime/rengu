The Way is ever nameless,
a modest the unhewn block.
Yet none dare not respect it.
If one instilled its simpleness,
all things in nature would acquiesce.
Heaven and earth would reunite.
A gentle dew would fall.
Peace and order, unenforced,
among the people would reign.

When once the block is hewn,
things multiply and names ensue.
Knowing when to end
frees one from peril.

All under heaven is received into the Way,
like valley streams cascading to the sea.
