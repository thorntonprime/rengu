In ancient times the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and
righteousness to meddle with the minds of men. Yao and Shun followed
him and worked till there was no more down on their thighs, no more
hair on their shins, trying to nourish the bodies of the men of the
world. They grieved their five vital organs in the practice of
benevolence and righteousness, taxed their blood and breath in the
establishment of laws and standards. But still some men would not
submit to their rule, and so they had to exile Huan Tou to Mount
Ch'ung, drive away the San-miao tribes to the region of San-wei, and
banish Kung to the Dark City. This shows that they could not make the
world submit.
