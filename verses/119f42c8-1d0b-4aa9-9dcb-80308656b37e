Steam becomes a mighty power only when it allows itself to be imprisoned in
a strong little reservoir and produces tremendous motion and carries huge
weights by permitting itself a tiny and measured outlet. Even so have the
youth of the country of their own free will to allow their inexhaustible
energy to be imprisoned, controlled and set free in strictly measured and
required quantities.
