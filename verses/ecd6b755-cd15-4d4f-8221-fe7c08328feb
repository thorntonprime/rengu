He who avoids one passion, avoids them all severally; and he who avoids them
severally, avoids one. ...

He who knows wrath, knows pride; he who knows pride, knows deceit; he who
knows deceit, knows greed; he who knows greed, knows love; he who knows love,
knows hate; he who knows hate, knows delusion; he who knows delusion, knows
conception; he who knows conception, knows birth; he who knows birth, knows
death; he who knows death, knows hell; he who knows hell, knows animal
existence; he who knows animal existence, knows pain.

Therefore, a wise man should avoid wrath, pride, deceit, greed, love, hate,
delusion, conception, birth, death, hell, animal existence, and pain.
