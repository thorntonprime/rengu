Title: This Is What You Desired
---
Now listen, Eckhart, to Seneca,
such wisdom from the pagan philosopher!
What is it that will console you when
you are troubled or suffering?
This is simpleï¼š
accept that what you have
is exactly what you desired,
what you prayed for.
Or you would have desired it,
had you known
    the will of God.
