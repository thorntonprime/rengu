Title: Until They Become a Sky Again
---
The peace, it is there; it grows from her soil. A few feet beneath her surface,
 all is always perfectly calm.
What does she know of any storms then? What does she hear of any cries of this
 world, or is in any way startled by fear?
Once in a while something stirs a thirst she had forgotten about;
a divine rain falls on her hills and settles in a beautiful valley;
there, life's companion, water, gently reaches down and touches, awakens her
 heart.
She begins to reach up with all her strength, feeling a glorious destiny
 awaits,
and she keeps stretching out her arms until they become a sky again and all
 that is luminous in it.
Her love shelters then from all angles, above, below ... and to our sides.
Yes, it shelters us, any heart, like an earth, that knows God.
The peace is always there, just beneath a particle of our surface.
