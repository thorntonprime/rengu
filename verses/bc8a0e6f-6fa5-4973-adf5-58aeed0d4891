Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Heaven is honorable, earth lowly - such are their ranks in spiritual
enlightenment. Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter follow -
such is the sequence of the four seasons. The ten thousand things
change and grow, their roots and buds, each with its distinctive form,
flourishing and decaying by degree, a constant flow of change and
transformation. If Heaven and earth, the loftiest in spirituality, have
yet their sequence of honorable and lowly, of preceder and follower,
how much more must the way of man! In the ancestral temple, honor is
determined by degree of kinship; in the court, by degree of nobility;
in the village, by degree of seniority; in the administration of
affairs, by degree of worth. This is the sequence of the Great Way.
