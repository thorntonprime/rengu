O flaming Heart,
Unseen and unimagined in this wildernss,
You, You alone are real, and here I've found You.
Here will I love and praise You in a toungeless death,
Until my white devoted bones,
Long bleached and polished by the winds of this Sahara,
Relive at Your command,
Rise and unfold the flowers of their everlasting spring.
