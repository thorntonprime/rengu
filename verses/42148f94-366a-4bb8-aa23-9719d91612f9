All things began as One, the mother of the world.
Knowing the mother, you may know the offspring.
Hence you may return to the Source
and dwell beyond the fear of death.

Close your heart
and shutter all entries：
your life will ever be filled.
Open your heart,
let concerns run wild：
your life will never be stilled.

Finding significance in the small is insight.
Yielding against pressure is strength.

Use the light without to be enlightened within,
lest you invite catastrophe.
Such is cultivating the perpetual.
