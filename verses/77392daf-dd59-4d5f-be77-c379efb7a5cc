Nowadays men can not love seven night but they must have all their desires：
that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon accorded, and hasty
heat, soon it cooleth. Right so fareth love nowadays, soon hot soon cold： this
is no stability. But the old love was not so; men and women could love together
seven years, and no lycours lusts were between them, and then was love, truth,
and faithfulness： and lo, in likewise was used love in King Arthur’s days.
