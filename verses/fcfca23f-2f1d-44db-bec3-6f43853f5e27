Cleanse your own heart, cast out from your mind, not Procrustes and Sciron,
but pain, fear, desire, envy, ill will, avarice, cowardice, passion
uncontrolled. These things you cannot cast out, unless you look to God alone,
on Him alone set your thoughts, and consecrate yourself to His commands. If
you wish for anything else, with groaning and sorrow you will follow what is
stronger than you, ever seeking peace outside you, and never able to be at
peace; for you seek it where it is not, and refuse to seek it where it is.
