Title: Tears
---
No one’s crazy enough to think tears are pearls --
that’s crazier than to mistake blood for rubies.
This is the rambling of the loser in love at a dark crossroad;
or the twisted words of a demented poet.
If tears are pearls, I’ll bury all pearls in the dust,
except for the keepsake ring you gave me.

I’ve never seen jade ornamented with tears;
I’ve never seen tears drunk like wine at banquets of peace.
No one’s foolish enough to think tears are pearls.
No -- the tears you give me are tears of pearl.
I’ll cry tears of pearl for you until my shadow leaves my body.
Every day, I hear the sighing jade flute in the immortal land of tears.
My tears form countless streams, and each tear is a creation.

Tear's jewels; sigh’s spring wind; peerless treasures sanctifying
 love’s ground!
When will love be perfected by tears that flood space and time?
