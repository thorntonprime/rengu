“Gya-gya” -- these baby sounds of delight are reminiscent of Master
Dong-shans “Jewel Mirror Samadhi,” where he says, “Just as in the
common infant, the five characteristics are complete, no going, no coming
no arising, no abiding. Ba-ba wa-wa, speaking without speaking." In the
Nirvana Sutra, the five characteristics of the common infant are equated
with the behavior of the Tathagata, the Buddha. An infant is unable to
get up, stay put, come, go or talk. In the same way, the Tathagata does
not raise the thought of any dharma, does not abide in any dharma, does
not have a body capable of action such as coming or going because he is
already in nirvana. In addition, although it is said that the Buddha taught
for forty seven years, in fact, he never uttered a single word.
