Title: Nothing to Frighten Us
---
We are not prisoners. No traps or snares are set around us; there is nothing
that should frighten or torment us. We have been put into life as into the
element we most accord with, and we have, moreover, through millennia of
adaptation, come to resemble this life so greatly, that we, when we hold still,
through a happy mimicry, can hardly be distinguished from everything that
surrounds us.
