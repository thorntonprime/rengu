There are two kinds of sainthood. The first is merely a departure from enmity,
and in this sense is general to all believers; it is not necessary that
the individual should be aware of it, or realise it, for it is only to be
regarded in a general sense, as in the phrase, ‘The believer is the friend
(wall) of God.’ The second is a sainthood of peculiar election and choice,
and this it is necessary for a man to be aware of and to realise. When a
man possesses this, he is preserved from regarding himself, and therefore
he does not fall into conceit; he is withdrawn from other men, that is, in
the sense of taking pleasure in regarding them, and therefore they do not
tempt him. He is saved from the faults inherent in human nature, although
the stamp of humanity remains and persists in him; therefore he does not
take delight in any of the pleasures of the soul, in such a way as to be
tempted in his religion, although natural delights do persist in him. These
are the special qualities of God’s friendship (wilâyah) towards man; and
if a man has these qualities, the Enemy will have no means of reaching him,
to lead him astray; for God says, ‘Verily, as for My servants, thou hast
no authority over them’.
