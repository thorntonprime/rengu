Claim nothing for yourself.
Relax and let God operate you
and do what He will with you.
The deed is His; the word is His;
the birth is His; and all you are is His,
for you have surrendered self to Him,
with all your soul's agents and their functions
and even your personal nature.

Then at once,
God comes into your being and faculties,
for you are like a desert,
despoiled of all that was peculiarly your own.

The scripture speaks of
the voice of one crying in the wilderness.
Let His voice cry in you at will.
Be like a desert as far as self
and the things of this world are concerned.
