By successfully concealing his crimes a person can’t consider himself
honorable. He knows he’s done wrong. By constantly bragging a person can’t
claim to be famous even though he does hear his name mentioned everywhere
he goes. By affecting the manners of holy men monks may receive veneration
, but a pious demeanor never made anyone a saint. What are true honor, true
recognition and true piety? They are internal qualities, not superficial
acts or appearances. When a man’s conscience is free from stain, he is
honorable. When his reputation for integrity precedes him, he is famous.
When humility and reverence for the Dharma flow naturally out of his
character, he is esteemed.
