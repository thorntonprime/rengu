Pigs eat dead man meat.
Folks eat dead pig guts.
Pigs don't mind man-stink.
People even say cooked pig smells good,
but if a pig dies, people heave it in the river,
and when a man dies, he's buried, out of sight.
Then both pigs and men just have to do without.
But the pure white lotus of the Buddha
is born and lives, in boiling water.
