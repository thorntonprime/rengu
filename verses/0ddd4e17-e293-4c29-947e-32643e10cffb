Title: Wait and Gather

Poems don't come to much when they are written too soon. One should wait and
gather the feeling and flavors of a whole life, and a long life if possible,
and then, just at the end, one might perhaps be able to write ten good
lines. For poems are not, as people suppose, emotions -- those come easily
and quickly enough. They are experiences.

For the sake of one line of poetry, one must see many cities, people, and
things. One must be acquainted with animals and feel how the birds fly, and
know the gestures of small flowers opening at the first light. One must be
able to think back on paths taken through unknown places, on unanticipated
meetings, and on farewells one had long seen coming, on days of childhood not
yet understood; on parents one disappointed when they offered some pleasure
one could not grasp (it was a pleasure suited to another); on childhood
illnesses that came on so strangely, altering everything; on days in closed
and quiet rooms and on mornings by the sea; on the sea itself, on all seas;
on night journeys that rose and flew with the stars. ...
