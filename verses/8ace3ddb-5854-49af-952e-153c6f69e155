The common run of men all welcome those who are like themselves and
scorn those who differ from themselves. The reason they favor those who
are like themselves and do not favor those who are different is that
their minds are set on distinguishing themselves from the crowd. But if
their minds are set on distinguishing themselves from the crowd, how is
this ever going to distinguish them from the crowd? It is better to
follow the crowd and be content, for, no matter how much you may know,
it can never match the many talents of the crowd combined.
