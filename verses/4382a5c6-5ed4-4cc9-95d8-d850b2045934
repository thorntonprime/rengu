Title: Our Invisible Property
---
The experience and inclination and affection we put into familiar things cannot
be replaced. We are perhaps the last who still will have known such things. On
us is the responsibility not only to remember them, but to know their value.

The earth has no other recourse but to become invisible in us, who belong
in part to what is invisible; and our own invisible property can increase
during our span here.
