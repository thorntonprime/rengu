Be your beginning plain： and take good heed
Too soon you mount not on the airy steed,
Nor tell your reader, in a thundering verse,
"I sing the conqueror of the universe.”
What can an author after this produce?
The laboring mountain must bring forth a mouse.
Much better are we pleased with his address,
Who without making such vast promises,
Says in an easier style and plainer sense,
“I sing the combats of that pious prince
Who from the Phrygian coast his armies bore,
And landed first on the Lavinian shore.”
His opening muse set not the world on fire,
And yet performs more than we can require.
Quickly you’ll hear him celebrate the fame
And future glory of the Roman name,
Of Styx and Acheron describe the floods,
And Caesars wandering in the Elysian woods.
