In the same manner as lovers gradually advance from that beauty which
is apparent in sensible forms, to that which is divine; so the ancient
priests, when they considered that there is a certain alliance and sympathy
in natural things to each other, and of things manifest to occult powers,
and discovered that all things subsist in all, they fabricated a sacred
science from this mutual similarity. Thus they recognized things supreme in
such as are subordinate, and the subordinate in the supreme.
