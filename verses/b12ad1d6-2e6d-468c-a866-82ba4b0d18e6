We must let you know, that there was a friendship established by our and
your grandfathers; and a mutual council fire was kindled. In this friendship
all those then under the ground, who had not yet obtained eyes or faces
were included; and it was then mutually promised to tell the same to their
children and children’s children. But so many great men of your nation
have died in so short a time, that none but youths are left; and this makes
us afraid, lest that treaty, so solemnly established by your ancestors,
should be forgotten by you. We therefore now come to remind you of it,
and renew it; we rekindle the old fire, and put on fresh fuel.
