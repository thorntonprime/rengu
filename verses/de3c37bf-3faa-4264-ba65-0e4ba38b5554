The healing of evil -- scientifically or otherwise -- can be accomplished
only by the love of individuals. A willing sacrifice is required. The
individual healer must allow his or her own soul to become the
battleground. He or she must sacrificially absorb the evil.

Then what prevents the destruction ofthat soul? If one takes the evil
itselfinto one's heart, like a spear, how can one’s goodness still
survive? Even if the evil is vanquished thereby, will not the good he
also? What will have been achieved beyond some meaningless trade-off?

I cannot answer this in language other than mystical. I can say only that
there is a mysterious alchemy whereby the victim becomes the victor. As
C. S. Lewis wrote： “When a willing victim who had committed no
treachery was killed in a traitor’s stead, the Table would crack and
Death itselfwould start working backwards."

I do not know how this occurs. But I know that it does. I know that
good people can deliberately allow themselves to be pierced by the evil
of others -- to be broken thereby yet somehow not broken -- to even be
killed in some sense and yet still survive and not succumb. Whenever this
happens there is a slight shift in the balance of power in the world.
