When a man sets his thoughts and his inward active endeavour on the
virtues and on outward behaviour more than on God and on union with
God; though he remains in the grace of God (for in the virtues he aims
at God), yet none the less his life is unstable, for he does not feel
himself to rest in God above all virtues. And therefore he possesses
something that he does not know; for. Him Whom he seeks in the virtues
and in the multiplicity of acts, he possesses within himself, above
intention, above virtues, and above all ways and means. And therefore,
if this man would overcome his fickleness, he must learn to rest above
all virtues in God and in the most high Unity of God.
