I was born just thirty years ago,
But Iâ€™ve wandered a million miles already.
Along the River through the green grass on the
 banks,
out to the borderlands, where the red dust roils.
Chewed herbs, cooked up alchemical elixirs,
trying to become an Immortal.
Read all the Writings, chanted the Histories
 aloud.
Trying to learn them all by heart ...
Today I'm on my way
home to Cold Mountain.
There, I'll bed down in the creek, just to wash out
 my ears.
