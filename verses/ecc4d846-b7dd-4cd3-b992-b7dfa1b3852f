Title: Hardness
Commentary: |
  In an age when hardness is supposed to be the essence of strength, and even
  the beauty of women is reduced nearly to the bone, I welcome this reminder
  that tanks and tombstones are not very adequate role models, and that to be
  alive is to be vulnerable.

Living people
are soft and tender.
Corpses are hard and stiff.
The ten thousand things,
the living grass, the trees,
are soft, pliant.
Dead, they’re dry and brittle.

So hardness and stiffness
go with death;
tenderness, softness,
go with life.

And the hard sword fails,
the stiff tree’s felled.
The hard and great go under.
The soft and weak stay up.
