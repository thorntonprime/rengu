“The hat, my boy, the hat, whatever it may be, is in itself nothing --
makes nothing, goes for nothing; but, be sure of it, everything in life
depends upon the cock of the hat.” For how many men -- we put it to your

that beset fortune, not by the innate worth and excellence of their hats,
but simply, as Sampson Piebald has it, by “the cock of their hats”? The
cock’s all.
