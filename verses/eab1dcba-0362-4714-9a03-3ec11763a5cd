A certain man came and knocked at a friend’s door： his friend asked him,
 ‘Who art thou, O trusty one?’
He answered, ‘I’. The friend said. ‘Begone, ’tis not the time： at
 a table like this there is no place for the raw.’
Save the fire of absence and separation, what will cook the raw one? Who
 will deliver him from hypocrisy?
The wretched man went away, and for a year in travel and in separation from
 his friend he was burned with sparks of fire.
That burned one was cooked： then he returned and again paced to and fro
 beside the house of his comrade.
He knocked at the door with a hundred fears and respects, lest any
 disrespectful word might escape from his lips.
His friend called to him. ‘Who is at the door?’ He answered, ‘ ’Tis
 thou art at the door. O charmer of hearts.’
‘Now,’ said the friend, ‘since thou art I, come in, O myself： there
 is not room in the house for two I’s.
The double end of thread is not for the needle： inasmuch as thou art single,
 come into this needle.’
’Tis the thread that is connected with the needle： the eye of the needle
 is not suitable for the camel.
