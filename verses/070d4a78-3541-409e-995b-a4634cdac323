\“We had been set to learn a passage from one of Paul's Epistles by heart. I
had already got this, and I sat turning the dreary-looking pages of the
school edition of the Bible, covered in shiny black. One hand was thrust into
my inside pocket, clasping the tiny silver watch as a talisman. The other
stopped at the page opening on the Fourth Gospel. I saw the phrase, ‘In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.’

“I felt the hair on my head tingling, and a curtain of red blood appeared
to fall before my eyes. I leaned forward, clasping myself close, while the
world rocked around me. And as this earthquake subsided, I saw a new sky --
line defined. It was a landscape in which objects and words were fused. All
was one, with the word as the verbal reality brought to material life by Mind,
by man. It was therefore the very obvious, tangible presence of the Creator.
“Sitting in Surrey Lane School ... I received a philosophy which I have
never lost, a working faith in the oneness of all life. My fears of evil,
the old Satanic dreads due to the division between the flesh and the spirit,
vanished in that moment [my italics] of revelation. Everything was now
contained, for me, in the power of the Word.

“... on this sharp and concise symbolism I was to build a concept of
universal singleness that gave me authority over the horrors, the divisions,
the guilt complexes, that beset us all as we go through life, in a world
supposedly split into two, the flesh and the spirit, where civil war rages
eternally, in sombre Miltonic gloom and hopelessness."
