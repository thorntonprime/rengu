 It must be remembered that Abraham lived among the Chaldeans, who were
 renowned astronomers, and that the sense of this allegory is purely interior.

Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he
might be of those possessing certainty：

When the night grew dark upon him he beheld a star. He said： This is my
Lord. But when it set, he said： I love not things that set.

And when he saw the moon uprising, he said： This is my Lord. But when it
set, he said： Unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be of the folk who
are astray.

And when he saw the sun uprising, he said： This is my Lord, this is
greater. And when it set, he said： O my people! Lo! I am free from all
that ye associate (with Him).

Lo! I have turned my face toward Him who created the heavens and the earth,
as one by nature upright, and I am not of the idolaters. ...

(Thus) We raise unto degrees of wisdom whom We will. Lo! thy Lord is Wise,
Omniscient.
