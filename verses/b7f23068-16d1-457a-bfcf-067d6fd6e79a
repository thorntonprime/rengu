A great nation flows down To be the world's pool, The female under heaven
 In stillness The female constantly overcomes the male, In stillness Takes
 the low place.
Therefore a great nation Lowers itself And wins over a small one. A small
 nation keeps itself low And wins over a great one.
Sometimes becoming low wins, Sometimes staying low wins.
A great nation desires nothing more Than to unite and protect people. A
 small nation desires nothing more Than to enter the service of people.
When both get what they wish The great one should be low.
