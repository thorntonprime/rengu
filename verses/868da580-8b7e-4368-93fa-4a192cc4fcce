People ought not to consider so much what they are to do as what they
are; let them but be good and their ways and deeds will shine
brightly. If you are just, your actions will be just too. Do not think
that saintliness comes from occupation; it depends rather on what one
is. The kind of work we do does not make us holy but we may make it
holy. However ‘sacred’ a calling may be, as it is a calling, it has no
power to sanctify; but rather as we are and have the divine being
within, we bless each task we do, be it eating, or sleeping, or
watching, or any other. Whatever they do, who have not much of (God’s)
nature, they work in vain.
