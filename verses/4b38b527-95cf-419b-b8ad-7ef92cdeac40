The soul ascends from corporal things and, being caught up above herself,
abides within herself ... for the sake of the delights she finds in God. For
the divine perfection invests her in him with his likeness. His fullness is
poured forth without stint; angels more in number than the sands and grass
and water-drops and every single angel with his own distinctive nature,
not one the same as any other.
