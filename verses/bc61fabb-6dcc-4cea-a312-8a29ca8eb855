Come forward now, you who are laden with vanity and gross stupidity and
vast pretence, you that are wise in your own conceit and not only declare
(in every case) that you perfectly know what each object is, but go so far
as to venture in your audacity to add the reasons for its being what it is,
as though you had either been standing by at the creation of the world,
and had observed how and out of what materials its several parts were
fashioned, or had acted as advisers to the Creator regarding the things He
was forming -- come, I say, and then, letting go all other things whatever,
take knowledge of yourselves, and say clearly who you are, in body, in soul,
in sense-perception, in reason and speech, in each single one, even the most
minute, of the subdivisions of your being. Declare what sight is and how
you see, what hearing is and how you hear, what taste, touch, smelling are,
and how you act in accordance with each of them, or what are the springs and
sources of these, from which is derived their very being. For pray do not, O ye
senseless ones, spin your airy fables about moon or sun or the other objects
in the sky and in the universe so far removed from us and so varied in their
natures, until you have scrutinized and come to know yourselves. After that,
we may perhaps believe you when you hold forth on other subjectsï¼š but before
you establish who you yourselves are, do not think that you will ever become
capable of acting as judges or trustworthy witnesses in the other matters.
