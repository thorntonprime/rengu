Title: Life's Other Half
---
I am not saying that we should love death, but rather that we should
love life so generously, without picking and choosing, that we
automatically include it (life's other half) in our love. This is what
actually happens in the great expansiveness of love, which cannot be
stopped or constricted. It is only because we exclude it that death
becomes more and more foreign to us and, ultimately, our enemy.

It is conceivable that death is infinitely closer to us than life
itself. ...  What do we know of it?
