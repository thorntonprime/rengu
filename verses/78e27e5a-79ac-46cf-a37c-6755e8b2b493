Behind my work was ambition, behind my love was personality, behind my purity
was fear, behind my guidance the thirst for power! Now they are vanishing and
I drift. I come. Mother, I come, in Thy warm bosom -- floating wheresoever
Thou takest me -- in the voiceless, in the strange, in the wonderland. I
come, a spectator, no more an actor!
