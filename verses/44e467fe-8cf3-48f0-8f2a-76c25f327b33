To some people, God reveals Himself in the Quality of Knowledge (al-'ilm);
for as God is revealed in the Life which penetrates everything, so does the
servant taste in the unity of this life all that constitutes the nature of
things. Consequently, the Essence is revealed to him in the cognitive quality,
so that he will know the entire universe with the unfolding of all its worlds,
from their origin until their return to principle; he knows how each thing was.
how it is and how it will be; he knows that which did not exist and that which,
not existing, was not non-existent; he knows how that which is not would be if
it was. He has of all this a fundamental, principial and intuitive knowledge,
through his own essence and by virtue of his penetration -- both integral and
distinctive -- of the objects of knowledge; he knows in a distinctive manner
in his integration, although his knowledge is realized in the Unmanifested.
