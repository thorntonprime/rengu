Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
In the world today, the victims of the death penalty lie heaped
together, the bearers of cangues tread on each other's heels, the
sufferers of punishment are never out of each other's sight. And now
come the Confucianists and Mo-ists, waving their arms, striding into
the very midst of the fettered and manacled men. Ah, that then should
go this far, that they should be so brazen, so lacking in any sense of
shame! Who can convince me that sagely wisdom is not in fact the wedge
that fastens the cangue, that benevolence and righteousness are not in
fact the loop and lock of these fetters and manacles? How do I know
that Tseng and Shih are not the whistling arrows that signal the
approach of Chieh and Chih? Therefore I say, cut off sageness, cast
away wisdom, and the world will be in perfect order.
