Title: Touziâ€™s Correct Hits
---
A monk asked Touzi, Every sound is Buddhas sound.
Correct or not?

Touzi said, Correct.

The monk said,  farts
the chirping sound of the Buddhas bowl?

Touzi then hit.

He again asked, Coarse words and fine speech all return
to the primary meaning. Correct or not?

Touzi said, Correct.

The monk said, May I call the Venerable to be taken for

Touzi then hit.
