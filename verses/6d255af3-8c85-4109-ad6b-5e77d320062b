Title: If
---
If I could love
    as God loves
I would not
    fear the judgment
of others
    or the loss of my
very self and would
    know that God is
the one who knows
    and loves and desires
himself and all
    things and loves
me most when
    I finally let go of
trying and simply
    let myself live love.
