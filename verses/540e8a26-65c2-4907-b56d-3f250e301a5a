Title: Tatooing in Qazwin
---
In Qazwin they have a custom of tattooing themselves
for good luck, with a blue ink,
on the back of the hand, the shoulder, whatever.

A certain man there goes to his barber
and asks to be given a powerful, heroic blue lion
on his shoulder blade.

And do it with flair. I have Leo Ascending.
I want plenty of blue.

But as soon as the needle starts pricking,
he howls, What are you doing?

The lion.

Which part did you start with?

I began with the tail.

Leave out the tail. That lion's rump
is in a bad place for me. It cuts off my wind.

The barber continues and immediately
the man yells out, Ooooooooooooo, which part now?

The ear.
Doc, let's do a lion with no ears this time.

The barber shakes his head and once more
the needle and once more, the wailing.
Where are you now?
The belly.
I like a lion without a belly.

The master lion-maker stands for a long time
with his fingers in his mouth.
Finally, he throws the needle down.
No one has ever asked me to do such a thing.
To create a lion without a tail or a head or a stomach.
God himself could not do it.

Brother, stand the pain. Escape the poison
of your impulses. The sky will bow to your beauty
if you do. Learn to light the candle. Rise
with the sun. That way a thorn expands to a rose.
A particular glows with the universal.

What is it to praise? Make yourself particles.
What is it to know something of God?
Burn inside that presence. Burn up.
