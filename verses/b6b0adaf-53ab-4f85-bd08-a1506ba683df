Title: Heshan Beats the Drum
---
Heshan handed down words saying, "Rote study is to hear of the
meaning. Exhaustive study is near to the meaning. To cross over these
two things is indeed genuine crossing over."

A monk came out and asked, "So, what is genuine crossing over?"

Shan said, "Being free to beat the drum."

He again asked, "So, what is genuine truth?"

Shan said, "Being free to beat the drum."

He again asked, "As it is heart-mind and as it is Buddha, as it is I do
not question. So, what is neither heart-mind nor Buddha?"

Shan said, "Being free to beat the drum."

He again asked, "Turning to the arrival of the superior person, at that
time, so, what is received?"

Shan said, "Being free to beat the drum."
