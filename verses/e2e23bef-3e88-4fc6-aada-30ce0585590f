The white crane flew with a bitter-flavored blossom,
resting just once in a thousand li.
He wanted to fly to P'englai Island,
where all the fairies dwell,
with only that flower to eat on the way.
First his feathers began to fall,
then far from the flock his heart fell too.
How he wished for his old nest,
but his wife and his boy never knew.
