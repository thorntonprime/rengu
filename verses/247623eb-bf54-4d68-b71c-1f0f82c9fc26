Suppose a ruler wants ... a garment made from cloth that is difficult to
cut properly; he will certainly look for a skilful tailor. ... To cure
a sick horse, he will certainly look for a skilful physician, For all
such tasks the ruler will not employ his relatives, nor those who are
rich and noble but lack merit, nor those who are merely good-looking,
for he understands that they are not capable of performing them. ... But
when it is a question of governing the state, it is not so, For this task,
the ruler selects those who are merely good-looking. ... Does he care less
for the state than for a sick horse or a suit of clothes? ...

When the sage-kings of old governed the world, those whom they enriched and
ennobled were not necessarily their relatives, or the rich and noble, or
the good-looking, Thus Shun had been a farmer ... a potter ... a
fisherman ... and a peddler, But Yao discovered him ... made him emperor,
and turned over to him the control of the empire and the government of
the people.
