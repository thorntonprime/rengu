We search for meaning, we search for belonging, and that means that we are
all exploring God-territory. But that territory is so vast that you can go on
forever and ever exploring one part of it and never meet other groups that
explore other parts. There are certain crossroads where you choose to go in
a certain direction. After that, you are not likely to reach the territory
others are exploring who took a different turn.

One of those crossroads is the discovery that belonging is mutual. Ifwe belong
to God, God belongs to us; we are in a relationship. This is mysticism of
course, but any one of us can experience it daily. God is related to us in
a personal way. Thatâ€™s the experiential basis for the notion that God must
have all the perfection that makes me a person and none of the limitations.
