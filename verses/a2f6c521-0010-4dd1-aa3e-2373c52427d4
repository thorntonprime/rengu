  Title: The Clouds Should Know Me by Now
---
emptiness is a long story
that swallows up heaven and earth
a splash of ink turns into two dragons
stray clouds become an azure dog

lurking in my bowl： mountains, rivers
wheeling through my breast： a sun, a moon
a fierce wind shreds the ancient mists
grasses and trees bow before its snap and snarl
