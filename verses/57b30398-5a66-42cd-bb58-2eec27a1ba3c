Title: How these young presumptuous disciples misunderstand this other
  word “up”; and of the deceits that follow thereon
---
No more of these at this time now： but forth of our matter, how that these
young presumptuous ghostly disciples misunderstand this other word up.

For if it so be, that they either read, or hear read or spoken, how that
men should lift up their hearts unto God, as fast they stare in the stars
as if they would be above the moon, and hearken when they shall hear any
angel sing out of heaven. These men will sometime with the curiosity of
their imagination pierce the planets, and make an hole in the firmament to
look in thereat. These men will make a God as them list, and clothe Him
full richly in clothes, and set Him in a throne far more curiously than
ever was He depicted in this earth. These men will make angels in bodily
likeness, and set them about each one with diverse minstrelsy, far more
curious than ever was any seen or heard in this life. Some of these men
the devil will deceive full wonderfully. For he will send a manner of dew,
angels’ food they ween it be, as it were coming out of the air, and softly
and sweetly falling in their mouths; and therefore they have it in custom
to sit gaping as they would catch flies. Now truly all this is but deceit,
seem it never so holy; for they have in this time full empty souls of any
true devotion. Much vanity and falsehood is in their hearts, caused of their
curious working. Insomuch, that ofttimes the devil feigneth quaint sounds in
their ears, quaint lights and shining in their eyes, and wonderful smells in
their noses： and all is but falsehood. And yet ween they not so, for them
think that they have ensample of Saint Martin of this upward looking and
working, that saw by revelation God clad in his mantle amongst His angels,
and of Saint Stephen that saw our Lord stand in heaven, and of many other;
and of Christ, that ascended bodily to heaven, seen of His disciples. And
therefore they say that we should have our eyes up thither. I grant well
that in our bodily observance we should lift up our eyes and our hands if
we be stirred in spirit. But I say that the work of our spirit shall not
be direct neither upwards nor downwards, nor on one side nor on other, nor
forward nor backward, as it is of a bodily thing. For why, our work should
be ghostly not bodily, nor on a bodily manner wrought.
