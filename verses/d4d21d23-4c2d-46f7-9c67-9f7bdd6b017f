Title: If Not Forsaken
---
When I lie in bed, sleeping then waking, waking then sleeping,
a lone lamp watches the night like a faithful guard.
If you don’t forsake me,
I’ll become life’s lamp to keep watch over you a hundred years.

When I sit at my desk reading this and that,
the words obligingly yield good stories, pure songs, solemn lessons.
If you don’t forsake me,
I’ll become a reliable primer to suit your fancy.

When I see my lips in the mirror awaiting your kiss,
the faithful mirror smiles as I smile, frowns as I frown.
If you don’t forsake me,
I’ll become the heart’s mirror and faithfully share your pain
 and pleasure.
