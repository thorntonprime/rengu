You do not see clearly the evil in yourself, else you would hate
yourself with all your soul.

Like the lion who sprang at his image in the water, you are only
hurting yourself. O foolish man.

When you reach the bottom of the well of your own nature, then you
will know that the vileness was from yourself.
