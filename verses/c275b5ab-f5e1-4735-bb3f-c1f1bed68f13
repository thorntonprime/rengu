Because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the
soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and believes that to be
true which the body affirms to be true; and from agreeing with the body and
having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits and haunts,
and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure to the world below, but is
always infected by the body; and so she sinks into another body and there
germinates and grows, and has therefore no part in the communion of the
divine and pure and simple.
