If one does not seek after the great Tao in order to release himself from the
wrong mode of life, he will Anally lose his chance of possessing the
talent -- and is not to be regarded as a wise man. A hundred years of living is
but a transient moment, the length of which resembles only a spark struck
from a stone. The fate of life is like a bubble Aoating on water. Those who
know nothing but income, emolument, fame, and rank will soon see their faces
turning pale and their bodies degenerating. I suppose that the gain of money
is capable of filling the valleys; however this non-permanent possession
cannot purchase the things which do not come back.
