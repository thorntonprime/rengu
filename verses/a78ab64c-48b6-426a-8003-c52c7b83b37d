Title: One Who Can Quit Seeing Himself
---
I look for one simple and open enough to see the friend,
not an intelligence weighing several perspectives.

I want an empty shell to hold this pearl,
not a stone who pretends to have a secret center,
when the surface goes all the way through.

I want one who can quit seeing himself, fill with God,
and instead of being irritated by interruption
and daily resentments, feel those as kindness.
