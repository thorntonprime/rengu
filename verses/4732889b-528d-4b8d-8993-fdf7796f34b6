Anyone who says that he finds no pleasure in sounds and melodies and music is
either a liar and a hypocrite or he is not in his right senses, and is outside
of the category of men and beasts. Those who prohibit music do so in order that
they may keep the Divine commandment, but theologians are agreed that it is
permissible to hear musical instruments if they are not used for diversion, and
if the mind is not led to wickedness through hearing them.
