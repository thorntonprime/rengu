Title: My Divinely Appointed Place
---
God has brought me to Kentucky, where the people are, for the most part,
singularly without inhibitions.This is the precise place He has chosen
for my sanctification. Here I must revise all my own absurd plans,
and take myself as I am, Gethsemani as it is, and America as it is --
atomic bomb and all. It is utterly peculiar, but nonetheless true, that,
after all, one’s nationality should come to have a meaning in the light
of eternity. I have lived for thirty-six years without one. Nine years
ago I was proud of the fact. I thought that, to be a citizen of heaven,
all you had to do was throw away your earthly passport. But now I have
discovered a mystery： that the ladies in the Office of the Deputy Clerk
of the Louisville District are perhaps in some accidental way empowered
to see that I am definitely admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven forever.

For now I am beginning to believe that perhaps the only, or at least the
quickest, way that I shall become a saint is by virtue of the desires of
many good people in America that I should become one. Last night I dreamt
I was telling several other monks, “I shall be a saint," and they did
not seem to question me. Furthermore, I believed it myself. If I do --
(I shall) -- it will be because of the prayers of other people who, though
they are better than I am, still" want me to pray for them.
