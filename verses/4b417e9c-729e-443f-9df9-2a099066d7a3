Title: That Does Not Know Sadness
---
You entered form to give a holy message. An envoy from the inconceivable is
 each of us.
When you have completed that courageous task you will be able to return to
 a world that does not know sadness.
What is it that you need to say to us, or do? So difficult your divine errand,
 it may take
lifetimes to accomplish ... always loving. But also, in no way ever being
 a prude.
