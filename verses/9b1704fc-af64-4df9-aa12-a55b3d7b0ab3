Title: Wandering and Coming Back
---
I have fone to many cities,
but I have never found anyone like you.
Coming back, a strange joy fills me.

What can I say about this wandering with unlucky travelers?
I was dead. Now I live.
Is it that I have seen your face and heard your voice?
Allow the evidence to show.
Give me something.

Say, I have a gift for you, Joseph,
this bright-polished face.
