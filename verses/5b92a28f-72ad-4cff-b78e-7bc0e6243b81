Title: Strife
---
Strife shows itself in various ways. Open contention occurs when the
contenderfeels himself to be in the right. When not in the right, he resorts
to blatant impositions or cunning subterfuges. But carrying conflicts to
the bitter end only perpetuates enmity. The superior man is clear-headed
and inwardly strong, meets opponents halfway, and is ready to submit his
case to authoritative andjust arbiters. Difficult enterprises are not to
be undertaken under such conditions.
