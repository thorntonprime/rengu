Mother-Goddess is reawakening, and we can begin to recover our primal
birthright, the sheer, intoxicating joy of being alive. We can open new
eyes and see that there is nothing to be savedfrom, no struggle of life
against the universe, no God outside the world to be feared and obeyed;
only the Goddess, the Mother, the turning spiral that whirls us in and
out of existence, whose winking eye is the pulse of being -- birth, death,
rebirth -- whose laughter bubbles and courses through all things and who
is found only through loveï¼š love of trees, of stones, of sky and clouds,
of scented blossoms and thundering waves; of all that runs and flies and
swims and crawls on her face; through love of ourselves; life-dissolving
world-creating orgasmic love of each other; each of us unique and natural
as a snowflake, each of us our own star, her Child, her lover, her beloved,
her Self.
