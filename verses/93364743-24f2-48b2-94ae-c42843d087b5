Title: A Christian Remnant to Preach Peace
---
I am coming to see clearly the great importance of the concept of
“realized eschatology” -- the transformation of life and of human
relations by Christ now (rather than an eschatology focused on future
cosmic events -- the Jewish poetic figures to emphasize the transcendence
of the Son of God). “Realized eschatology” is the heart of genuine
Christian humanism and hence its tremendous importance for the Christian
peace effort, for example. The presence of the Holy Spirit, the call to
repentance, the call to see Christ in man, the presence of the redeeming
power of the Cross in the sacraments： these belong to the “last age,”
which we are in. But all these do not reveal their significance without a
Christian mission of peace, the preaching of the Gospel of unity, peace,
and mercy, the reconciliation of man with man, and so with God.This duty,
however, does not mean that there will not at the same time be great cosmic
upheavals.The preaching of peace by a remnant in an age of war and Violence
is one of the eschatological characteristics of the life of the Church. By
this activity of the Church the work of God is mysteriously accomplished
in the world.
