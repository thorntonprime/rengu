He who would gain a golden understanding of the word of truth, should have the
eyes of his soul opened, and his mind illumined by the inward light which God
has kindled in our hearts from the beginning. ... Although no man ever has,
or ever can, see God with his outward bodily eyes, yet with the inward eyes
of the soul He may well be seen and known.
