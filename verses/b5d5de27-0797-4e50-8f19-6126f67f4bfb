The nil tzû (lady) dresses in green whereas the lang chiin (husband)
puts on mourning white. If they are visible, then they cannot be used
for our purpose. Things which are useful are invisible. They encounter
one another in a state of obscurity whereby they make their changes
indistinctly. At the moment when a flame flashes out suddenly, the
chên jên (true man) appears to us.
