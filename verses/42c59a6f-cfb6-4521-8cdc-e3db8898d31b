---
Far-off, within my heart,
  As in a tomb,
Fair as the morning rising
  Out of the gloom,
A low, bewildering light
  Grew and became
A splendor in the darkness,
  A clear flame.

And faintly a lyric voice
  To me alone
Called from the hidden depths
  Of deeps unknown.
Higher it rose, as nearer
  And nearer it movedï¼š
Called, and I heard it calling
  -- Awake, beloved! --
