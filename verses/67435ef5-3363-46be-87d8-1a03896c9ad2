Title: Only Love Can Grasp Them
---
Works of art belong immeasurably to themselves, and are accessible least
of all to criticism. Only love can grasp them and hold them and respond to
them fairly. Always trust your own feeling, rather than others' discussions,
interpretations and arguments. Should you be mistaken, then slowly and with
time the natural growth of your inner life will bring you to fuller awareness.
