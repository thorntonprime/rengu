A man is possessed of limited powers and is miserable; he wants to expand his
powers so that he may be happy. But consider if it will be so; if with
limited perceptions one is miserable, with extended perceptions the misery
must increase proportionately. ... What is the real power? Is it to increase
prosperity or bring about peace? That which results in peace is the highest
perfection.
