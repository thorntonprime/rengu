Some keep the Sabbath going to Church --
I keep it, staying at Home --
With a Bobolink for a Chorister --
And an Orchard, for a Dome.

Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice --
I, just wear my Wings --
And instead of
tolling the bell, for Church,
Our little Sexton -- sings.
God preaches, a noted Clergyman --

And the sermon is never long,
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last --
I'm going, all along.
