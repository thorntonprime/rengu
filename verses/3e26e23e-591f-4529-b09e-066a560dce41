Title: Nanquan Draws a Circle
---
Nanquan, Guizong, and Magu together went to do customary
respects to National Teacher Zhong. Stopping half way, Nanquan drew
the image of one circle on top of the dirt and said, If youre able to
say then well leave.

Guizong sat in the middle of the circle image. Magu
then did the bow of a woman.

Quan said, Is it like this? The standard is not to
leave!

Guizong said, What is going in your mind?
