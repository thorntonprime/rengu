Tomorrow Sts. Nereus and Achilleus： I said their office in anticipation
in the fresh green woods after work clearing brush, where the fire still
smoked. I will always remember their little empty church in Rome, half in
the country, on a spring afternoon in 1933.

“The Lord has plucked up proud men by their roots, and planted the
lowly peoples.” “He hath put down the mighty.”

If I were more fully attentive to the word of God I would be much
less troubled and disturbed by events of our time： not that I would
be indifferent or passive, but I could gain strength of union with the
deepest currents of history, the sacred currents, which run opposite to
those on the surface a great deal of the time!

“Do not quarrel about a matter that does not concern you; and when
sinners judge, do not sit in council with them” (Ecclesiasticus).

This especially strikes me： “Be wary, take very great care, because
you are walking with your own downfall; when you hear such things, wake
up and be vigilant.” It seems to me that at the moment I very much need
this kind of “attention” and “listening,” for I have come to the
most serious moments of my life.
