Title: All and Ever Only Love
---
I often wonder if I am lovable,
and love cautiously because

I know how easily I can be
hurt and my heart broken.

but You do not hesitate
toward me, since You

are all love and only love,
and when You love You

love without measure, and
when YOU love me in

this way I find who I am
and who You are, which

is all and ever only love.
