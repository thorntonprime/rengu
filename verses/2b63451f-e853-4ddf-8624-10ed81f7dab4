Master Kuang Ch'eng said, "What you say you want to learn about
pertains to the true substance of things, but what you say you want to
control pertains to things in their divided state. Ever since you
began to govern the world, rain falls before the cloud vapors have even
gathered, the plants and trees shed their leaves before they have even
turned yellow, and the light of the sun and moon grows more and more
sickly. Shallow and vapid, with the mind of a prattling knave - what
good would it do to tell you about the Perfect Way!"
