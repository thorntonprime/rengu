He that beholds the sun of righteousness arising upon the horizon of his
soul with healing in its wings, and chasing away all that misty darkness of
his own self-will and passions; such a one desires not now the star-light to
know whether it be day or not, nor cares he to pry into heavenâ€™s secrets,
and to search into the hidden rolls of eternity, there to see the whole plot
of his salvation; for he views it transacted upon the inward stage of his own
soul, and reflecting upon himself, he may behold a heaven opened from within,
and a throne set up in his soul, and an almighty Saviour sitting upon it,
and reigning within him; he now finds the kingdom of heaven within him,
and sees that it is not a thing merely reserved for him without him, being
already made partaker of the sweetness and efficacy of it. ... It is not an
airy speculation of heaven as a thing (though never so undoubtedly) to come,
that can satisfy his hungry desires, but the real possession of it even in this
life. Such a happiness would be less in the esteem of good men, that were only
good to be enjoyed at the end of this life when all other enjoyments fail him.
