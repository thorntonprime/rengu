Title: The Comfort of Frogs
---
One thing the hermitage is making me see -- that the universe is my home and I
am nothing if not part of it.The destruction of the self that seems to stand
outside the universe only as part of its fabric and dynamism. Can I find
true being in God who has willed me to exist in the world? This I discover
here in the hermitage, not mentally only but in depth. Especially, for
example, in the ability to sleep. Frogs kept me awake at the monastery,
not here -- they are comfort, an extension of my own being -- and now
also the hum of the electric meter near my bed is nothing (although at
the monastery it would have been intolerable). Acceptance of nature and
even technology as my true habitat.
