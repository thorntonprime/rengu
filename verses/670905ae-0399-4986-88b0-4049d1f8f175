The changing mind of man cannot be satisfied permanently with
anything. What he likes at one time, he does not like at another. What
he wants now. he does not want later. The only way for a man to be
always happy is to submit to Godâ€™s will and.  leaving everything to
Him, be content with the condition in which He places him. From
changing circumstances we cannot get real happiness. Happiness lies
within Surrender means inner contentment and peace.
