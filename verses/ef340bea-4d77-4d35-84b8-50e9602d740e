Have courage to look up to God and say, â€˜Deal with me hereafter as
Thou wilt. I am as one with Thee. I am Thine. I flinch from nothing so
long as Thou thinkest it good. Lead me, where Thou wilt, put on me
what raiment Thou wilt. Wouldst Thou have me hold office, or eschew
it, stay or fly, be poor or rich? For all this I will defend Thee
before men. I will show each thing in its true nature, as it is.'
