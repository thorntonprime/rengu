God’s Providence, from the Fall to the restitution of all things, is doing the
same thing as when He said to the dark chaos of fallen nature, ‘Let there be
light’; He still says and will continue saying the same thing, till there is no
evil of darkness left in all that is nature and creature. God creating, God
illuminating, God sanctifying, God threatening and punishing, God forgiving and
redeeming, is but one and the same essential, immutable, never-ceasing working
of the divine nature. ...

That all-powerful, all-purifying blood of the Lamb ... will never cease washing
red into white, till the earth is washed into the crystal purity of that glassy
sea which is before the throne of God, and all the sons of Adam clothed in such
white as fits them for their several mansions in their heavenly Father’s house.
