The Messiah (Peace be upon him!) said, ‘O you who seek the world to be
charitable with it, your leaving of it alone is more charitable.’ And
he said, ‘The least thing is such that Sin looking after it occupies
one to the exclusion of glorifying God, and glorifying God is 64
greater and more important.’
