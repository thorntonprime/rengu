Plato saith, That there are three Kings, round whose Thrones all things
dance; God, the Mind, the Soul; this continual procession of the Soul from
the Divine Mind, through the Angelical Mind, in the entire Image of it,
with all its Divine Forms, and their Order, their Harmony, their Unity in
the whole compass of their Variety, is the mystical Dance of the Soul round
the Throne of her King, her Bridegroom, by which at once she contemplates,
enjoys, springs up into his Divine Form in all its Beauties, and is filled
with him. He in like Manner hath her ever before him, as the Looking-Glass
of his own Beauty, lying and playing in himself, as the Image of a Flower
or Tree in the Water, every way circled in by him, as she is centered in him.
