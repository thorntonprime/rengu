Satchidânanda is like an endless expanse of water. The water of the great ocean
in cold regions freezes into blocks of ice. Similarly, through the cooling
influence of divine love, Satchidânanda assumes forms for the sake of the
bhaktas The heat of the sun of Knowledge melts the ice-like form of the
Personal God. On attaining the Knowledge of Brahman and communing with It in
nirvikalpa samâdhi, one realizes Brahman, the Infinite, without form or shape
and beyond mind and words.
