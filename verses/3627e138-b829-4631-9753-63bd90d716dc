Title: How a man may wit when his ghostly work is beneath him or without
  him, and when it is even with him or within him, and when it is above
  him and under his God
---
And for this, that thou shalt be able better to wit how they shall be conceived
ghostly, these words that be spoken bodily, therefore I think to declare to
thee the ghostly bemeaning of some words that fall to ghostly working. So
that thou mayest wit clearly without error when thy ghostly work is beneath
thee and without thee, and when it is within thee and even with thee, and
when it is above thee and under thy God.

All manner of bodily thing is without thy soul and beneath it in nature,
yea! the sun and the moon and all the stars, although they be above thy body,
nevertheless yet they be beneath thy soul.

All angels and all souls, although they be confirmed and adorned with grace
and with virtues, for the which they be above thee in cleanness, nevertheless,
yet they be but even with thee in nature.

Within in thyself in nature be the powers of thy soulï¼š the which be these
three principal, Memory, Reason, and Will; and secondary, Imagination and
Sensuality. Above thyself in nature is no manner of thing but only God.

Evermore where thou findest written thyself in ghostliness, then it is
understood thy soul, and not thy body. And then all after that thing is on
the which the powers of thy soul work, thereafter shall the worthiness and
the condition of thy work be deemed; whether it be beneath thee, within thee,
or above thee.
