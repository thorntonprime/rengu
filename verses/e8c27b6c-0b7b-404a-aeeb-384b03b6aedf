Title: Daowu Doesnâ€™t Say
---
Daowu and Jianyuan arived to share condolences with one family.

Yuan patted the coffin and said, Is alive the mistaken view or dead
the mistaken view?

Wu said Either alive dont say, or dead dont say.

Yuan said, Why dont say?

Wu said, Dont say, dont say.

On the road in the middle of the return trip, Yuan said, Venerable, be
straightforward with me and begin to say. If Wu doesnt say, then Ill
hit the venerable and go away too.

Wu said, If you hit, of course Ill allow the hit. To say, of course,
dont say.

Yuan then hit.

Later Daowu moved into transformation (i.e., he died). Yuan went to
Shishuang and brought up the previous conversation. Shuang said,
Either alive dont say, or dead dont say.

Yuan said, Why dont say?

Shuang said, Dont say. Dont say.

As these words fell, Yuan had insight.

One day, Yuan went up to the dharma hall with a shovel. and from the
east went across
to the east.

Shuang said, Wat are you doing?

Yuan said,  prior masters spirit-bone relics.

Shuang said, Flooding waves vast and unbounded, the white billows
overflow the sky
prior master?

Xuedous attached words said, Blue skies, blue skies.

Yuan said, A just right show of power

Tai Yuan Fu said, It seems the prior masters spirit-bone relics are
present.
