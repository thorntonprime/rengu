To have all that has being and is lustily to be desired and brings delight;
to have it all at once and whole in the undivided soul and that in God,
revealed in its perfection, in its flower, where it first burgeons forth
in the ground of its existence, and all conceived where God is conceiving
himself -- that is happiness.
