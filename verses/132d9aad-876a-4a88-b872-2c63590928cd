And as oft in some great concourse, when Sedition lifts her head and the
nameless vulgar kindles to rage -- when brands and stones are already
flying, and fury ministers arms -- if they chance to behold a man of
reverend goodness and worth, on the instant all are mute; and about him
they stand with listening ear, while he sways their spirit by his word and
allays their passion： even so sank all that tumult of ocean, when Father
Neptune looked forth on the waves, and, floating under a cloudless heaven,
guided his steeds and flew outward, giving rein to his speeding car.
