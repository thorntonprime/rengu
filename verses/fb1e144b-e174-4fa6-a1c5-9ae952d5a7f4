There are such who perhaps think themselves willing that God should have his
due. providing that he also let them enjoy their own without any let or
molestation; but they are very jealous lest he should encroach too much upon
them, and are careful to maintain a meum and tuum with heaven itself, and to
set bounds to Godâ€™s prerogative over them, lest it should swell too much, and
grow too mighty for them to maintain their own privileges under it. They
would fain understand themselves to be free-born under the dominion of God
himself, and therefore ought not to be compelled to yield obedience to any
such laws of his as their own private seditious lusts and passions will not
suffer them to give their consent unto.
