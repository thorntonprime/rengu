  - Combat-Action=Pilgrimage-Descent Into Hell=The Descent Into Hell
By: St Teresa of Avila
Commentary: |
  The Plains Indians say the rattlesnake is most deadly in summer when
  shedding its skin, for this renders him temporarily blind. The
  metamorphic symbolism of the 'shedding of skins' has its
  correspondence with iniliatic death and rebirth.

Faith is then as dead, and asleep, like all the other virtues; not
lost, however. -- for the soul truly believes all that the Church
holds; but its profession of the faith is hardly more than an outward
profession of the mouth. And on the other hand, temptations seem to
press it down, and make it dull, so that its knowledge of God becomes
to it as that of something which it hears of far away. ... The soul
itself is then burning in the fire, knowing not who has kindled it nor
whence it comes, nor how to escape it, nor how to put it out; if it
seeks relief from the fire by spiritual reading, it cannot find any. ...
To converse with any one is worse, for the devil then sends so
offensive a spirit of bad temper that I think I could eat people up：
nor can I help myself. I feel that I do something when I keep myself
under control： or rather our Lord does so. when He holds back with His
hand any one in this state from saying or doing something that may be
hurtful to his neighbours and offensive to God.
