Title: Accepting My Place in Creation
---
One lovely dawn after another, Such peace! Meditation with fireflies, mist in
the valley, last quarter of the moon, distant owls -- gradual inner awakening
and centering in peace and in a harmony of love and gratitude, Yesterday
I wrote to the man at McGill University who thought all contemplation was
a manifestation of narcissistic regression! That is just what it is not,
A complete awakening of identity and rapport! It implies an awareness and
acceptance of one’s place in the whole, first the whole of creation,
then the whole plan of Redemption -- to find oneself in the great mystery
of fulfillment which is the Mystery of Christ, Consonantia and not confusio.

Jack Ford brought me a couple of loaves of pumpernickel from a Jewish
delicatessen in Louisville Monday, and he also gave me some excellent tea,
which I iced myself for supper tonight, Twining’s Earl Grey, It was
superb! And that was about all I had for supper with a can of mandarin
oranges, Cool and pleasant, But it is still hot, The sky is cloudy,
The birds still sing, Maybe there will be rain tonight.

At Mass I shall pray especially for the Buddhist Vo Tanh Minh, who has
been fasting since March in Brooklyn in protest against the fighting
in Vietnam, He will probably die, as there is little likelihood of a
cease-fire, His calm and peace are completely admirable.
