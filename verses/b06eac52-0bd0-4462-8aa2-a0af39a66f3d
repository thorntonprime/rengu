Title: It Happens All the Time in Heaven
Description: October 1
---
It happens all the time in heaven, and someday it will begin to happen again
 on earth --
that men and women who are married, and men and men who are lovers,
and women and women who give each other light,
often will get down on their knees, and while so tenderly holding their
 lover’s hand, with
tear-filled eyes, will sincerely say, “My dear, how can I be more loving
 to you; my darling,
how can I be more kind?”
