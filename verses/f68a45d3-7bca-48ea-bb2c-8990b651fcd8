Whatever your belief about the nature of God, God becomes to you what
you believe Him to be. If you think God is cruel, punishing, vindictive
and that He sends sickness, pain and suffering, you will live in fear,
dread and guilt. These negative attitudes will create every opportunity
to demonstrate Godâ€™s wrath. If you believe that God is love, wisdom and
beauty, you will live in happy expectation and joy -- that will attract
wondrous transformation in your life.
