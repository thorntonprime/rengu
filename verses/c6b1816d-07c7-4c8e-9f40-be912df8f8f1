If what you have gotten has gotten you into trouble, then can you
really be said to have gotten something? If so, then the pigeons and
doves in their cage have also gotten hold of something. With likes and
dislikes, sounds and colors you cripple what is on the inside; with
leather caps and snipe-feathered bonnets, batons stuck in belts and
sashes trailing, you cramp what is on the outside. The inside hemmed in
by pickets and pegs, the outside heaped with wraps and swathes, and
still you stand in this tangle of wraps and swathes and declare that
you have gotten hold of something? If so, then the condemned men with
their chained wrists and manacled fingers, the tiger and the leopard in
their pens and prisons have also gotten hold of something!
