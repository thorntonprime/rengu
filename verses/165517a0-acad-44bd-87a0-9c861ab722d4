Title: Little Erect Things Feel Proud
---
I heard that in some monasteries there were human skulls on the tables where
  the monks ate to remind them of their transitoriness,

and that they wore hair coats sometimes and maybe even whipped themselves, and
  would even mutilate their bodies if they ever had a sexual desire.

In the spring God looks happiest it seems, when it is clear a beautiful force
  is surely active on earthâ€”as if the Conductor lifted its baton

and everyone started to cuddle, and fur and feathers danced against each
  other's moist hot spots.

Little erect things feel proud, parade about, and then get stuck here and
  there. Depression reaches a low point in the mating season; maybe we should
  extend it to being year-round?

But maybe you have tried that? Did it work? Send us a report.
