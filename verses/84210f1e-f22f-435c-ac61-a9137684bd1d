You ought, O Soul, to get sure knowledge of your own being, and of its forms
and aspects. Do not think that any one of the things of which you must seek
to get knowledge is outside of you; no, all things that you ought to get
knowledge of are in your possession, and within you. Beware then of being
led into error by seeking (elsewhere) the things which are in your possession.
