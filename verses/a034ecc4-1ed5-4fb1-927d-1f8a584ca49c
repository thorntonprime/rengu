Confucius said, "Come, I will explain to you. For a long time I have
tried to stay out of the way of hardship. That I have not managed to
escape it is due to fate. For a long time I have tried to achieve
success. That I have not been able to do so is due to the times. If it
happens to be the age of a Yao or a Shun, then there are no men in the
world who face hardship - but this is not because their wisdom saves
them. If it happens to be the age of a Chieh or a Chou, then there are
no men in the world who achieve success - but this is not because their
wisdom fails them. It is time and circumstance that make it so.
