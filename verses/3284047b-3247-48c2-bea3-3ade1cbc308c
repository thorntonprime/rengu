We in our perversity want God to be merciful in such way as not to be
just. Others again, trusting all too much in their own justice, would
have God just in such a way that they do not wish Him to be merciful.
God shows himself to be both; He is supremely both. His mercy does
not prescribe His justice, nor does His justice sweep away His mercy.
He is merciful and just.
