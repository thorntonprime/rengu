If superiors adopt inaction and inferiors adopt inaction as well, then
inferior and superior will share the same virtue, and if inferior and
superior share the same virtue, there will be none to act as minister.
If inferiors adopt action and superiors adopt action as well, then
superior and inferior will share the same way, and if superior and
inferior share the same way, there will be none to act as lord.
Superiors must adopt inaction and make the world work for them;
inferiors must adopt action and work for the world. This is an
unvarying truth.
