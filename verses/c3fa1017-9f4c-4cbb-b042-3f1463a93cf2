Title: I Left Firewood & Smooching
---
There is a disease I know, it is called： being too serious.

Don't worry, you won't catch it from my poems.

I let eloquence have its say, and wisdom too and mirth, for they can
be needed companions as you navigate this dimension and others.

Wherever you have dreamed of going, I have camped there, and left
firewood for when you arrive.

Try this someday： When you are packing or moving any simple object
around -- imagine your Beloved's

hand -- as yours. And it then might become thus, if just for a second.

But a wondrous, true moment like that would be enough for the
integration to begin,

the meld of you and light ... and then the smooching, the wild
smooching all the time. Why not?
