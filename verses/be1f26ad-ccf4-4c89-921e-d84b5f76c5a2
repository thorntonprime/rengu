Title: Wujiuâ€™s Unjust Stick
---
A monk who was a follower of the assembly of Venerable
Dingzhous side came and arrived at Wujiu.

Wujiu asked, How does the Way of the Dharma of Dingzhou
resemble this side?

The monk said,  not different.

Jiu said, If not different then you should turn back to the
other center and go. Then he hit.

The monk said, The tip of the stick has eyes. Dont get
careless hitting a person.

Jiu said, Today I hit at one in particular! Then he
hit down thrice.

The monk then left.

Jiu said, An unjust stick, from the first arrival there
is a person enduring it.

The monk turned his body around and said, How can one
quarrel when the handle is in the Venerables palm?

Jiu said. If you want it, this mountain monk will turn
it around to give it to you.

The monk went close in front and grabbed the stick from
Jius palm and hit down on Jiu thrice.

Jiu said, An unjust stick, an unjust stick.

The monk said, There is a person enduring it

Jiu said, I carelessly hit at this particular fellow.

The monk then did a ritual bow.

Jiu said, A Venerable, but goes on like this!

The monk laughed greatly and
exited
Jiu said, Alleviating can be like this. Alleviating can
be like this.
