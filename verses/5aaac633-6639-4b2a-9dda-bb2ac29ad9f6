The bird of my heart is a Divine bird which nests on the Throne of God. It has
tired of the body’s cage and become weary of life in this world. When the
bird of the spirit flies from the top of this heap of dust -- this world --
it will find rest once more in that royal abode. When it takes its flight
from this world, the lote-tree of Paradise will be its resting-place. Know
that my falcon can rest only on the pinnacles of God's Throne.
