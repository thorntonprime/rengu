The slave boy and the slave girl were out together herding their sheep,
and both of them lost their flocks. Ask the slave boy how it happened：
well, he had a bundle of writing slips and was reading a book. Ask
the slave girl how it happened： well, she was playing a game of
toss-and-wait-your-turn. They went about the business in different
ways, but in losing their sheep they were equal. Po Yi died for
reputation at the foot of Shou-yang mountain; Robber Chih died for gain
on top of Eastern Mound.  The two of them died different deaths, but
in destroying their lives and blighting their inborn nature they were
equal. Why then must we say that Po Yi was right and Robber Chih wrong?
