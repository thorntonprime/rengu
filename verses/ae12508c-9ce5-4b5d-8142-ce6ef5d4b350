It is from selfishness that everything evil proceeds. Study all the vices,
and you will see that selfishness is at the bottom of them all. Combat them
as you will, you will never succeed in extirpating them until, attacking
the evil in it root, you have destroyed the selfishness which is their cause.
Let all your efforts tend to this end; for selfishness is the veritable
social gangrene.
