Title: Horses' Hoofs

The potter says, "I'm good at handling clay! To round it, I apply the
compass; to square it, I apply the T square." The carpenter says, "I'm
good at handling wood! To arc it, I apply the curve; to make it
straight, I apply the plumb line." But as far as inborn nature is
concerned, the clay and the wood surely have no wish to be subjected to
compass and square, curve and plumb line. Yet generation after
generation sings out in praise, saying, "Po Lo is good at handling
horses! The potter and the carpenter are good at handling clay and
wood!" And the same fault is committed by the men who handle the
affairs of the world!
