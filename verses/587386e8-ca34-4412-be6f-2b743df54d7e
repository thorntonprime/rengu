Tendance of heaven and of all things that are therein is nothing else
than constant worship; and there is no other being, divine or mortal,
that does this, but man alone. For in the reverence and adoration, the
praise and worship of men, heaven and the gods of heaven find pleasure
To some men then, but to very few, men who are endowed with mind
uncontaminate, has fallen the high task of raising reverent eyes to
heaven. But to all who, through the intermingling of the diverse parts
of their twofold being, are weighed down by the burden of the body,
and have sunk to a lower grade of intelligence -- to all such men is
assigned the charge of tending the elements, and the things of this
lower world.
