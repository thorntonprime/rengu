Just say, does this person also possess eye(s) or not? If you are able
to judge this person, then I approve that you have come to personally
see the people of old.

Vimalakirti asked Manjusri, "How do those ranked as
being bodhisattvas enter the Dharma gate of non-duality?"

Manju(sri) said, "So this is my idea, in everything, to
be without words, without explaining, without showing, and without
knowledge and to leave aside all questions and answers, is the act of
entering the Dharma gate of non-duality."

Thereat, Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, "Each and every one
of those equally ranked and myself have explained already. You who are
virtuous and equally ranked explain, how do those ranked as being
bodhisattvas enter the Dharma gate of non-duality?"

Xuedou said, "What did Vimala(kirti) say?"

Repeating he said, "Investigate and expose completely!"
