Confucius said, "Men do not mirror themselves in running water - they
mirror themselves in still water. Only what is still can still the
stillness of other things. Of those that receive life from the earth,
the pine and cypress alone are best - they stay as green as ever in
winter or summer. Of those that receive life from Heaven, Yao and Shun
alone are best - they stand at the head of the ten thousand things.
Luckily they were able to order their lives, and thereby order the
lives of other things. Proof that a man is holding fast to the
beginning lies in the fact of his fearlessness. A brave soldier will
plunge alone into the midst of nine armies. He seeks fame and can bring
himself to this. How much more, then, is possible for a man who governs
Heaven and earth, stores up the ten thousand things, lets the six parts
of his body be only a dwelling, makes ornaments of his ears and eyes,
unifies the knowledge of what he knows, and in his mind never tastes
death. He will soon choose the day and ascend far off. Men may become
his followers, but how could he be willing to bother himself about
things?"
