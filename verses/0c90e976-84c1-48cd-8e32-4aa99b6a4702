Title: The Speech a Day Makes
---
Yesterday all day a small gardenia was a great consolation. Since it rained,
I stayed in and wrote the review of the “Two Chinese Classics” sent
by Paul Sih (Tao Te Ching and Hsiao Citing).

Shortness of breath, and palpitations of the heart enough to be noticed,
quite prolonged. Not that I care. In any event it could be something merely
psychological! But I stayed long looking at a goldfmch and walked slowly
up through the woods, gazing at the tall straight oaks that are before
you reach the turnstile. Everything is beautiful and I am grateful for all
ofit. And maybe now I begin to be old, and walk slowly, like Victor Hammer.

When the Dalai Lama was young, still a boy, he was lonely in the Potola
and would walk on the roof looking through field glasses down upon the
houses of his subjects to see if they were having parties and to watch
their enjoyment. But they, in turn, would hide themselves so as not to
sadden him still more.

Sweet afternoon! Cool breezes and a clear sky! This day will not come again.

The bulls lie under the tree in the corner of their field. Quiet
afternoon! The blue hills, the daylilies in the wind.

This day will not come again.
