The antagonists of Christ therefore said to the poor： "You wait patiently
for the day of justice： there is no justice; you wait for the life eternal
to achieve your vengeance： there is no life eternal; you gather up your
tears and those of your family, the cries of the children and the sobs of
the women, to place them at the feet of God at he hour of death： there
is no God.”

Then it is certain that the poor man dried his tears, and he told his
wife to check her sobs, his children to come with him, and that he stood
upon the earth with the power of a bull. He said to the rich： "Thou
who oppressest me, thou art only man,“ and to the priest： “Thou who
hast consoled me, thou hast lied." That was just what the antagonists of
Christ desired. Perhaps they thought this was the way to achieve man’s
happiness, sending him out to the conquest of liberty.

But, if the poor man, once satisfied that the priests deceive him, that
the rich rob him, that all men have rights, that all good is of this world,
and that misery is impiety; if the poor man, believing in himself and his
two arms, says to himself some fine day, "War on the rich! for me, happiness
here in this life, since there is no other! for me, the earth, since heaven
is empty! for me and for all, since all are equal." Oh! reasoners sublime
who have led him to this, what will you say to him if he is conquered?
