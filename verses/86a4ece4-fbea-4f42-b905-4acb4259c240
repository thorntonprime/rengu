When all within is dark,
and former friends misprise;
from them I turn to you,
and find love in Your eyes.

When all within is dark,
and I my soul despise;
from me I turn to You,
and find love in Your eyes.

When all Your face is dark,
and Your just angers rise;
From You I turn to You,
and find love in Your eyes.
