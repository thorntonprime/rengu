The gardener flushed with anger and then said with a laugh, "I've heard
my teacher say, where there are machines, there are bound to be machine
worries; where there are machine worries, there are bound to be machine
hearts. With a machine heart in your breast, you've spoiled what was
pure and simple; and without the pure and simple, the life of the
spirit knows no rest. Where the life of the spirit knows no rest, the
Way will cease to buoy you up. It's not that I don't know about your
machine - I would be ashamed to use it!"
