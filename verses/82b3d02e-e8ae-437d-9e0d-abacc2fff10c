Title: You Are Christ's Hands
---
Christ has no body now on earth but yours,
  no hands but yours,
  no feet but yours,
Yours are the eyes through which is to look out
 Christâ€™s compassion to the world
Yours are the feet with which he is to go about doing good;
Yours are the hands with which he is to bless men now.
