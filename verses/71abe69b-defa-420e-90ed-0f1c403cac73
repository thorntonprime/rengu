Trying to control the world? I see you won't succeed.
The world is a spiritual vessel And cannot be controlled. Those who
 control, fail. Those who grasp, lose.
Some go forth, some are led, Some weep, some blow flutes, Some become
 strong, some superfluous, Some oppress, some are destroyed.
Therefore the Sage Casts off extremes, Casts off excess, Casts off
 Extravagance.
