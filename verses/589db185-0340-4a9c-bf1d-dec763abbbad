Tian Gen, rambling on the south of (mount) Yin, came to the neighbourhood
of the Liao-water. Happening there to meet with the man whose name is not
known, he put a question to him, saying, 'I beg to ask what should be done
in order to (carry on) the government of the world.' The nameless man said,
'Go away; you are a rude borderer. Why do you put to me a question for
which you are unprepared? I would simply play the part of the Maker of (all)
things. When wearied, I would mount on the bird of the light and empty air,
proceed beyond the six cardinal points, and wander in the region of nonentity,
to dwell in the wilderness of desert space. What method have you, moreover,
for the government of the world that you (thus) agitate my mid?' (Tian Gen),
however, again asked the question, and the nameless man said, 'Let your mind
find its enjoyment in pure simplicity; blend yourself with (the primary)
ether in idle indifference; allow all things to take their natural course;
and admit no personal or selfish consideration - do this and the world will
be governed.'
