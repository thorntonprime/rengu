For as there is body and soul in man, and in Scripture the letter and
the sense, so in every sacrament there is the visible external which
may be handled and the invisible within, which is believed and taught.
The material external is the sacrament, and the invisible and
spiritual is the sacramentâ€™s substance (res) or virtus. ... The
sacrament is the corporeal or material element set out sensibly,
representing from its similitude, signifying from its institution, and
containing from its sanctification, some invisible and spiritual
grace.
