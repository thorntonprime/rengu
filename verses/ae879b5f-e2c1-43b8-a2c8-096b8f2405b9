Lovable, very love, the Supreme is also self-love in that He is lovely no
otherwise than from Himself and in Himself. Self-presence can hold only in the
identity of associated with associating; since, in the Supreme, associated and
associating are one, seeker and sought one -- the sought serving as Hypostasis
and substrate of the seeker -- once more Godâ€™s being and his seeking are
identical.
