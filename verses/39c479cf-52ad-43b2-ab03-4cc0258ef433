God’s anger is no disturbance of mind in Him, but His judgment
assigning sin the deserved punishment; and His revolving of thought is
an unchanged ordering of changeable things. For God repents not of
anything He does, as man does： but His knowledge of a thing ere it be
done, and His thought of it when it is done, are both alike firm and
fixed.
