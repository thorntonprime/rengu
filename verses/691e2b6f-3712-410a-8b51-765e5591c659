know he wasn't. A little while ago, when I went in to mourn, I found
old men weeping for him as though they were weeping for a son, and
young men weeping for him as though they were weeping for a mother. To
have gathered a group like that, he must have done something to make
them talk about him, though he didn't ask them to talk, or make them
weep for him, though he didn't ask them to weep. This is to hide from
Heaven, turn your back on the true state of affairs, and forget what
you were born with. In the old days, this was called the crime of
hiding from Heaven. Your master happened to come because it was his
time, and he happened to leave because things follow along. If you are
content with the time and willing to follow along, then grief and joy
have no Way to enter in. In the old days, this was called being freed
from the bonds of God.
