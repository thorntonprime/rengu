Title: Creating for Always
Description: September 19
Format: Verse
---
Those who create are like you, God.
They long for the eternal.
Carving, they say： Stone, be forever!
And that means： be yours.

And lovers also gather your inheritance.
They are the poets of one brief hour.
They kiss an expressionless mouth into a smile
as if creating it anew, more beautiful.
