Perfection is the exclusive attribute of God and it is undescribable,
untranslatable. I do believe that it is possible for every human being
to become perfect even as God is perfect. It is necessary for all of
us to aspire after perfection, but when that blessed state is attained,
it becomes indescribable, undefinable.
