Title: The War
---
A lotus can’t become words -- life
bleeds out. Still I struggle
to engrave the water’s face, the lotic

Mess：

Daylight speckles the orchard.

I long to pin this dragonfly down
& press her in a tome, but she defies all essay
of inchworm & scissors
to sass other worlds

within the known. Define this
to quell the itch.

This：

α) I ramble through faded grasses at sunset, collecting night
on my bootlaces. Listen -- the rush of the abandoned lot.

β) A whiff of oenanthic hooks.

Lopsided & ankyroid, the riverside moon
pours buttermilk over rusted cars.

γ) Alice drifts through tides of pumpkin bisque.

In time -- in a trick of the light -- she dissolves
into swarms of plankton as they linger, curious.

The mushroom balloons wider in the dark.
