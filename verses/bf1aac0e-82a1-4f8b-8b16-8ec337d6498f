God did not put you in this world for any need he had of you, who are
wholly useless to him, but only in order to exercise in you his
goodness, giving you his grace and his glory.  ... Since you have been
created and put in the world with this intention, all actions contrary
to this must be rejected and avoided, and those which serve for
nothing to this end must be scorned, as vain and superfluous.

Consider the misfortune of the world which never thinks of this, but
lives as though it believed it was only created to build houses, plant
trees, amass riches and indulge in idle talk.
