To truly know one's own heart/mind is to see into the nature of the universe.
This very body and mind is the body and mind of the universe. Everything that we
encounter arises from the mind. But what is the mind? The great master
Bodhidharma said “You ask, that's your mind. I answer that‘s my mind. If I had
no mind, how could I answer? If you had no mind, how could you ask? That which
asks is your mind." This very mind is buddha, the reality of your own self
nature.
