Title: House Cricket
By: Tu Fu

House cricket ...
Trifling thing,
And yet how his mournful song moves us.
Out in the grass his cry was a tremble,
But now, he trills beneath our bed, to share his sorrow.
I like still beside you, finding no releaseï¼š
You, old wife, you suffer quiet through till dawn.
The song of our selves may move us, restless,
Through long nights, The cricket's song of autumn holds us still.
