Title: Jingqing In the Grass
---
Raised：

A monk asked Jingqing, "This student spits. I beg the
teacher to peck."

Qing said, "Yet, are you able to be alive or not?"

The monk said, "If I'm not alive, then people who encounter
me would marvel and laugh."

Qing said, "You too are a fellow in the grass."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

The Buddhas of old had a family style.

The raising of comparisons incurred devaluing and stripping away.

Child and mother do not recognize each other.

Is there someone who is equally spitting and pecking?

Pecking, awakening,

Yet even so, he's in the shell.

Valuing incurs a beating.

Patch-robed monks under Heaven disdain fame.
