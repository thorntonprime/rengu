Ch'ih-chang Man-chi said, "Everybody wants to see the world well
ordered. If it had been so already, what point would there have been in
calling in the man of the Yu clan? The man of the Yu clan was medicine
to a sore. But to wait until you go bald and then buy a wig, to wait
until you get sick and then call for a doctor,, to prepare the medicine
like a true filial son and present it to your loving father, wearing a
grim and haggard look - this the true sage would be ashamed to do. In
an age of Perfect Virtue the worthy are not honored, the talented are
not employed. Rulers are like the high branches of a tree, the people
like the deer of the fields. They do what is right but they do not know
that this is righteousness. They love one another but they do not know
that this is benevolence. They are truehearted but do not know that
this is loyalty. They are trustworthy but do not know that this is good
faith. They wriggle around like insects, performing services for one
another, but do not know that they are being kind. Therefore they move
without leaving any trail behind, act without leaving any memory of
their deeds."
