\‘Our families, from our earliest ancestors, have dwelt on the bank of this
river. Now we have never heard tell that a man walked upon the water. Who then
are you, and what is your magic recipe for walking upon the water without

The miraculous man answered them, ‘I am a simple and ignorant man from the
south of the river. Having heard say that the Buddha was here. I was anxious to
gladden myself with his wisdom and virtue. When I arrived at the southern bank,
it was not the time when the river was fordable： but I asked the people who
were on the bank of the river what was the depth of the water. They replied
that the water would reach to my ankle, and that nothing would prevent me from
crossing. I added faith to their words, and I have therefore come crossing the
river. I have no extraordinary recipe.'

The Buddha praised him, saying, ‘Well done! Well done! Truly, the man with
faith in the absolute truths is able to cross the gulf of births and deaths.
What is there extraordinary about it then that he should be able to cross a
river several li wide." Then the Buddha pronounced these stanzas： ‘Faith
(sraddhâ) can cross the gulf....'
