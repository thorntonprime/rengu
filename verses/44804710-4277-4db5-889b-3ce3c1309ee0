When you've got wine, invite folks in to drink.
If you get meat, invite them in for a meal!
The Yellow Springs wait for every man,
yet the young and strong must be hard workers.
The girdle of jade is just a flower;
gold pins are not the eternal jewel.
Old man Chang, old lady Cheng?
Haven't been seen, or heard from, lately.
