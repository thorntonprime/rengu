    Title: The Outsider
By: Colin Wilson

There are still many difficulties that cannot be touched on here. The problem
for the “civilization” is the adoption ofa religious attitude that can be
assimilated as objectively as the headlines of last Sunday’s newspapers. But
the problem for the individual always will be the opposite of this, the
conscious striving not to limit the amount of experience seen and touched;
the intolerable struggle to expose the sensitive areas of being to what may
possibly hurt them; the attempt to see as a whole, although the instinct
of self-preservation fights against the pain of the internal widening,
and all the impulses of spiritual laziness build into waves of sleep with
every new effort. The individual begins that long effort as an Outsider;
he may finish it as a saint.
