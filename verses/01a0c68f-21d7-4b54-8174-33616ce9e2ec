The unbeliever’s argument is always shamefaced： where is a single
sign that indicates the truth of that unbelief?

Where in this world is to be found a single minaret in praise of the
unbelievers, so that it should be a sign (of their veracity)? ...

The unbeliever’s argument is just this, that he says, ‘I see no place
of abode except this external world.’

He never reflects that, wherever there is anything external, that
object gives information of hidden wise purposes.

The usefulness of every external object is, indeed, internal： it is
latent, like the beneficial quality in medicines.
