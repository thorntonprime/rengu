Title: My Lover's Silence
---
My love is gone.
Ah, the one I love is gone.
Crossing the narrow path to the maple grove
  that shatters the mountain green, she tore away from me.
Promises, like bright gold blossoms,
turned into ash scattered by gentle wind.
The memory of a sharp first kiss reversed my destiny and then,
retreating, faded away to nothing.
I was deafened by her scented voice;
blinded by her flowerlike face.
Love is a human thing -- when meeiting I already feared parting,
and still with separation, my heart burst with fresh sorrow.

But to turn parting into useless tears destroys love,
and so I turned the stength of sadness into new hope.
Just as meeting creates worry of parting,
parting creates hope of meeting again.

My love is gone, but I didn't send her away.
My common song of love wraps itself around my lover's silence.
