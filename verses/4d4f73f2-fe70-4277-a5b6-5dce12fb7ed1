What is the best way to sever our attachment to material things?

First, we need a good sharp sword, a sword of discrimination, one that cuts
through appearance to expose the real. We begin by making a point of
noticing how quickly we became dissatisfied with material things and how
soon our sensory pleasures also fade into discontent. With persistent
awareness we sharpen and hone this sword. Before long, we find that we
seldom have to use it. We’ve cut down all old desires and new ones don’t
dare to bother us.
