A serious science of mythology must take its subject matter with due
seriousness, survey the field as a whole, and have at least some conception
of the prodigious range of functions that mythology has served in the
course of human history. It is dreamlike and, like dream, a spontaneous
product of the psyche; like dream, revelatory of the psyche and hence of
the whole nature and destiny of man; like dream -- like life -- enigmatic
to the uninitiated ego; and, like dream, protective of that ego. In the
simplest human societies mythology is the text of the rites of passage; in
the writings of the Hindu, Chinese, and Greek philosophers (as of all who
have ever read them) mythology is the picture language of metaphysics. The
first function is not violated by the second but extended; both harmoniously
bind man, the growing animal, to his world, simultaneously in its visible
and in its transcendent aspects. Mythology is the womb of mankind‘s
initiation to life and death.

Today that corporeal world has vanished and another has taken its place：
correlatively, that spiritual world has vanished and another has taken,
or is taking, its place. But no living system of symbols functioning for
engagement can survive when it has lost contact with the actual conscious
and unconscious worlds of its society -- when its references to the field
of waking consciousness have been refuted and its notices to the seats
of motivation are no longer felt. Like the signs referring to the known,
so the symbols referring to the relatively unknown are functions of the
knowledge of the time.
