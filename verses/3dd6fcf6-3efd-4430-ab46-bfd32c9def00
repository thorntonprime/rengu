Everything must have a nucleus around which sensations can develop. The
more your spirit finds its center, the higher is the aspect of health,
peace and tranquillity. And then a glimpse of the Infinite may become
possible. Choose ... a symbol or a sound as center of your thought and hold
to it constantly. ... In our times it is very difficult for a worshipper
to acquire a conception of the Divine, whether through methods of yoga,
whether in seeking to dissolve the individual self into the universal Self.
