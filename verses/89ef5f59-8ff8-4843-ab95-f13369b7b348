Title: What Makes Me Tick
---
Fear of ignorance that comes from clinging to a stupid idea. Fear of
ignorance that comes from submersion in the body, in surrender to the need
for comfort and consolation. Yet, at the same time, one must not fear
the possibility of relative lucidity in all these things, provided they
are understood. There is a little lucidity in love, a little lucidity in
alcohol, a little lucidity in religion, but there is also the danger of
being engulfed more or less easily in all this. My great fear is then the
fear of surrendering to sham lucidity and to the “one source” theory of
lucidity -- clinging to one kind of affirmation and excluding everything
else -- which means sinking back into ignorance and superstition. One of
the worst sources of delusion is, of course, an exclusive attachment to
supposed “logic” and reason. Worse still when the logic and reason
are centered on what claims to be religious truth. This can be as deep a
source of blindness as any in the world, sex included. One always has to
distinguish and go beyond： one has to question reason in order to get to
the deeper awareness of reality that is built into life itself. What I fear
is living in such a way that life becomes opaque and onesided, centered
on one thing only, the illusion of the self. Everything else has to be
defined in relation to this kind of ignorance. Once this is understood,
you can understand what makes me run -- not only run in the sense of escape
but run in the sense of tick.
