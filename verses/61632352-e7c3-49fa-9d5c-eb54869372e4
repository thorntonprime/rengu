A question is raised about those angels who live with us, serving and
guarding us, as to whether or not they have less joy in identity than
the angels in heaven have and whether they are hindered at all in
their (proper) activities by serving and guarding us. No! Not at all!
Their joy is not diminished, nor their equality, because the angel’s
work is to do the will of God and the will of God is the angel’s work.
If God told an angel to go to a tree and pick off the caterpillars,
the angel would be glad to do it and it would be bliss to him because
it is God’s will.
