Among the gifts which All√¢h (may He be glorified and exalted!) grants His
slave ... in this world ... is that of having at his will and in all liberty
the entire earth -- both continents and seas; if he wishes, he can go through
the air or walk on the water or cover the whole surface of the earth in less
than an hour.
