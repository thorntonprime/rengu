Title: The Turning Of Heaven

\"Thus it is that the rituals and regulations of the Three August Ones
and the Five Emperors are prized not because they were uniform, but
because they were capable of bringing about order. The rituals and
regulations of the Three August Ones and the Five Emperors may be
compared to the haw, the pear, the orange, and the citron. Their
flavors are quite different, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Rituals
and regulations are something that change in response to the times. If
you take a monkey and dress him in the robes of the Duke of Chou, he
will bite and tear at them, not satisfied until he has divested himself
of every stitch. And a glance will show that past and present are no
more alike than are a monkey and the Duke of Chou!
