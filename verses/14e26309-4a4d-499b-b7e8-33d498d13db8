I want to be saved ... and I want to save.
I want to be set free ... and I want to free.
I want to be born ... and I want to give birth.
I want to hear ... and I want to be heard.
Sweetness dances. I want to pipe; all of you dance.
I want to run away ... and I want to stay.
I want to make you beautiful ... and I want to be beautiful.
I want to join with you ... and I want to be joined.
I have no house ... and I have houses.
I have no ground ... and I have ground.
I have no temple ... and I have temples.
If you look at me ... I will be a lamp.
If you see me ... I will be a mirror.
If you knock on me ... I will be a door.
If you are a traveler ... I will be a road.
This is my dance ... Answer me with dancing.
