You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in
the Purâna that Râma, who was God Himself -- the embodiment of
Absolute Brahman -- had to build a bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon.
But Hanumân, trusting in Râma’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and
reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge.

Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Râma’s name on
a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to
him： ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But look
here -- the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.’ The man was
walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see
what was tied in his cloth. He opened it and found only a leaf with
the name of Râma written on it.  ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the
name of Râma!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the
water.
