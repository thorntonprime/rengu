True words are rarely elaborate.
Elaborate words are rarely truthful.
Good words are rarely eloquent.
Eloquent words are rarely good.
He who knows is rarely learned.
He who is learned rarely knows.
The wise do not hoard wisdom.
Giving to others what they have
They have still more.
Sharing what they have with others
They are richer still.
Heavenâ€™s Way helps and never harms.
The Way of the wise is generous
And free from all contention.
