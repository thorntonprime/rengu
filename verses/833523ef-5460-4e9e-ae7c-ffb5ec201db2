Title: The Hermitage Master Doesn't Turn His Head
---
The master of the Hermitage of Lotus Flower Peak picked up
his staff to show the assembly and said, "The people of ancient times
arrived at this place, why didn't they agree to dwell here?"

The assembly had no words, so he substituted himself and
said, "They did not gain strength on their journey. "

Again he said, "When completely finished, what is it like?"

Again he substituted himself and said, "With a chestnut
walking stick across my shoulders I am not a person who turns my head
around to look back. I directly enter the 1,000 peaks and the 10,000
peaks." And he left.
