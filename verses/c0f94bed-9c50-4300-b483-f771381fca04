Title: A Pie Where You Live
---
God brought me to an emerald field and said, “Harvest me.”
As I began to load my wagon with the divine, from what the sickle moon and
 I cut,
seeing its extraordinary worth, He spoke again, saying,
“But don’t charge too much for what I gave to you in exchange for a
 beautiful prayer.”
Not on its own will the meadow seek payment to be near its soft body;
someone, though, may stand there in a booth by a gate and make you pay to
 get close.
It is not like that with me. These words I have written, that He planted --
 grind them into a good bread you can carry as you travel.
Better yet, let them become the delicious amber crust to a wonderful pie
 you have, and invite many others over to eat.
