Now. this continual knocking of Christ at the door of the heart sets
forth the case or nature of a continual, immediate divine inspiration
within us; it is always with us, but there must be an opening of the
heart to it; and though it is always there, yet it is only felt and
found by those who are attentive to it, depend upon, and humbly wait
for it.
