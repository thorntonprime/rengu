\'His knowledge ... remaineth in the simplicity of His presence, and
comprehending the infinite spaces of that which is past and to come,
considereth all things in His simple knowledge as though they were now in
doing. So that, if thou wilt weigh His foreknowledge with which He discerneth
all things, thou wilt more rightly esteem it to be the knowledge of a never
fading instant than a foreknowledge as of a thing to come. For which cause it
is not called praevidence or foresight, but rather providence, because, placed
far from inferior things, it overlooketh all things, as it were, from the
highest top of things.'
