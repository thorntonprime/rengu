Any knowledge that does not bring us this supreme bliss and freedom is not
worth acquiring. We stuff our minds with knowledge of so many facts and things
gained from all and sundry, or reading all kinds of books. The brain becomes a
repository of learning about all the ephemeral and passing phases of life.
Naturally, such a man becomes a restless being -- unbalanced, confused and
erratic in his behaviour and conduct. Seek, therefore, to know the true source
of your life, -- God. That is why you are here.
