While Devaki. Krishna’s mother, was in prison, she had a vision of God
Himself endowed with four hands, holding mace, discus, conch-shell,
and lotus.  But with all that she couldn’t get out of prison. ...

The truth is that one must reap the result of the prârabdha karma.
The body remains as long as the results of past actions do not
completely wear away. Once a blind man bathed in the Ganges and as a
result was freed from his sins. But his blindness remained all the
same.
