Title: In The World Of Men
---
\"By being outwardly compliant, I can be a companion men. Lifting up the
tablet, kneeling, bowing, crouching down - this is the etiquette of a
minister. Everybody does it, so why shouldn't I? If I do what other
people do, they can hardly criticize me. This is what I mean by being a
companion of men.
