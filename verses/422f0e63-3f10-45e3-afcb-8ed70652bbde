Title: Yangshan Hiking on the Mountain
---
Raised：

Yangshan asked a monk, "What place did you come from
recently?"

The monk said, "Mt. Lu."

Shan said, "At that time did you roam on the Five Elders
Peak [at Mt. Lu]?"

The monk said, "At that time I didn't go there."

Shan said, "At that time the Preceptor did
not hike on the mountain."

[Later,] Yunmen said, "As these words were all for the
cause of compassion, they have fallen into chatting in the grass."

[Xuedou's] Ode says：

Exiting the grass, entering the grass

Who seeks release?

The white clouds' layer on layer,

The scarlet sun's brilliance in brilliance;

Turning the head and looking at the left side is without flaws,

Glaring at the right side stops (alt., is already) old age.

You didn't see the guy of Cold Mountain.

Walking extremely early.

For ten years unable to return [where he came from]

He actually forgot the Way since the time he arrived.

[Han Shan's verse cited in Yuan Wu's Commentary：]

If one longs to obtain a place for a tranquil life
Cold Mountain can excel at its preservation.

A gentle breeze puffs on the secluded pines;

Listen closely, the sound heals excellently!

Underneath, there is a person with white streaked hair

Reading in a whisper Huang and Lao.

Unable to return for ten years

He has actually forgotten the way since he arrived.
