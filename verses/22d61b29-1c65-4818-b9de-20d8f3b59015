God can be served in different ways. An ecstatic lover of God enjoys Him in
different ways. Sometimes he says, ‘O God, You are the lotus and I am the bee’,
and sometimes, ‘You are the Ocean of Satchidânanda and I am the fish.’
Sometimes, again, the lover of God says, ‘I am Your dancing-girl.’ He dances
and sings before Him. He thinks of himself sometimes as the friend of God and
sometimes as His handmaid. He looks on God sometimes as a child, as did Yasodâ,
and sometimes as husband or sweetheart, as did the gopis.
