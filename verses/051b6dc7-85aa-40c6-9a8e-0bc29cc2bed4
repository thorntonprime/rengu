For you must know that to the soul in her perfection goodness would come
quite natural; she would not merely practise virtues, but virtue as a whole
would be her life and she would radiate it naturally. We seem to be vicious
or virtuous from being now the one and now the other. This should not be;
we ought to be always in a state of perfection. That is one thing to note.
