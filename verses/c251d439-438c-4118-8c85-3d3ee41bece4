Title: Blocked Path
---
Your face isn’t the moon
but it crosses the mountains and waters to shine on me.
Why is my reach so short
that I can’t touch your breast in front of me?

If you would come to me, why don’t you?
It’s not that I can’t go to you,
but there’s no ladder by the cliff,
there’s no boat in the water.

Who took the ladder and destroyed the boat?
I’ll place a ladder of gems, make a boat of pearls.
I yearn for you who can’t come to me
because the path is blocked.
