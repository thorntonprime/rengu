Know that knowledge to be Sâttwica,1 by which is seen in all beings the One
Immutable, inseparate in the separate.

But the knowledge which sees in all beings the distinct entities of diverse
kinds as different from one another, know that knowledge to be Râjasica.

While that knowledge which is confined to one single effect, as if it were the
whole, without reason, not founded on truth, and trivial, that is declared to
be Tâmasica.
