Title: Do Not Despair
---
The stars send a message from the far above
I think it's a lesson that's filled with your love

Half of the world is asleep, is awake
Do not despair, do not despair
Today's gone to bed and tomorrow's unmade
Do not despair, do not despair

A last breath is taken, a first one is drawn
Do not despair, do not despair
Your loved one has left, a new one will come
Do not despair, do not despair

This is the lesson that comes from above
Do not despair, do not despair
You send the message, the message of love
Do not despair, do not despair
