Keichu, the great Zen teacher of the Meiji era, was the head of
Tofuku, a cathedral in Kyoto. One day the governor of Kyoto
called upon him for the first time.

His attendant presented the card of the governor, which readï¼š
Kitagaki, Governor of Kyoto.

"I have no business with such a fellow," said Keichu to his
attendant. "Tell him to get out of here."

The attendant carried the card back with apologies. "That was my
error," said the governor, and with a pencil he scratched out
the words Governor of Kyoto. "Ask your teacher again."

"Oh, is that Kitagaki?" exclaimed the teacher when he saw the
card. "I want to see that fellow."
