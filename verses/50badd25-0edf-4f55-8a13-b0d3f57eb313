At the highest point of his inner self, his soul, man is more God than
creature; however much he is the same as creature in his nature, in mind he is
like God more than any creature. To the soul at rest in God in her potential,
her essential, intellectual nature, everything comes natural as though she
were created not at the will of something else but solely at her own. In
this point creatures are her subjects, all submitting to her as though they
were her handiwork. It was in this power the birds obeyed St Francis and
listened to his preaching. And Daniel took refuge in this power, trusting
himself to God alone, when he sat among the lions. Moreover, in this power
it has been the custom of the saints to offer up their sufferings which,
in the greatness of their love, are to them no suffering.
