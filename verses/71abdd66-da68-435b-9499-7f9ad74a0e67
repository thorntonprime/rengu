My text saysï¼š 'God sent his only-begotten Son into the world,' by
which ye are to understand not the external world; it must be taken of the
inner world. As surely as the Father by his simple nature begets the Son
innately, so surely he begets him in the innermost recesses of the mind,
which is the inner world. Here God's ground is my ground and my ground
God's ground. Here I live in my own as God lives in his own. To one who
even for an instant has seen into this ground, a thousand ducats of red
beaten gold are worth no more than a false farthing.
