Myths are not only mirrors, but corridors of mirrors. When we enter them,
they become systems of thought branching towards the outer world and
tunnels of enlightenment rooting towards the unconscious soul. We have
constructed them to lead us back and forth from dream to vigil and from
sensation to experience, and ifwe wilfully abandon them, we will be left,
in the full meaning of the word, senseless.
