Then along comes Po Lo. "I'm good at handling horses!" he announces,
and proceeds to singe them, shave them, pare them, brand them, bind
them with martingale and crupper, tie them up in stable and stall. By
this time two or three out of ten horses have died. He goes on to
starve them, make them go thirsty, race them, prance them, pull them
into line, force them to run side by side, in front of them the worry
of bit and rein, behind them the terror of whip and crop. By this time
over half the horses have died.
