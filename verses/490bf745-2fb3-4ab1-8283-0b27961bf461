We believe that according to our desire we are able to change the things
round about us, we believe this because otherwise we can see no favourable
solution. We forget the solution that generally comes to pass and is also
favourable： we do not succeed in changing things according to our desire,
but gradually our desire changes. The situation that we hoped to change
because it was intolerable becomes unimportant. We have not managed to
surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has
taken us round it, led us past it, and then if we turn round to gaze at the
remote past, we can barely catch sight of it, so imperceptible has it become.
