Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
DOES HEAVEN TURN? Does the earth sit still? Do sun and moon compete for
a place to shine? Who masterminds all this? Who pulls the strings? Who,
resting inactive himself, gives the push that makes it go this way? I
wonder, is there some mechanism that works it and won't let it stop? I
wonder if it just rolls and turns and can't bring itself to a halt? Do
the clouds make the rain, or does the rain make the clouds? Who puffs
them up, who showers them down like this? Who, resting inactive
himself, stirs up all this lascivious joy? The winds rise in the
north, blowing now west, now east, whirling up to wander on high. Whose
breaths and exhalations are they? Who, resting inactive himself, huffs
and puffs them about like this?
