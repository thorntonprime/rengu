Commentary: Note in text refers to 'A prayer ascribed to Mhuammad' that says,
  'as they really are.'

O God, deliver us from preoccupation with worldly vanities, and show us
the nature of things ‘as they really are’. Remove from our eyes the
veil of ignorance, and show us things as they really are. Show not to us
non-existence as existent, nor cast the veil of non-existence over the
beauty of existence. Make this phenomenal world the mirror to reflect
the manifestations of Thy beauty, and not a veil to separate and repel us
from Thee. Cause these unreal phenomena of the universe to be for us the
sources of knowledge and insight, and not the cause of ignorance and blindness.
