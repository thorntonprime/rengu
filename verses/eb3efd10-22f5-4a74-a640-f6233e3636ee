Where there is (discursive) knowledge there is also ignorance. The sage
Vasishtha was endowed with great knowledge and still he wept at the death of
his sons. Therefore I ask you to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance. The
thorn of ignorance has pierced the sole of a man's foot. He needs the thorn of
knowledge to take it out. Afterwards he throws away both thorns. The jnâni
says. ‘This world is a “framework of illusion".' But he who is beyond
both knowledge and ignorance describes it as a ‘mansion of mirth". He
sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe, all living beings,
and the twenty-four cosmic principles.
