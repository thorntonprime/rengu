Hôjô Tokimune： ‘I have so much of worldly affairs to look after and
it is difficult to find spare moments for meditation.’

Bukkô Kokushi： ‘Whatever worldly affairs you are engaged in, take
them up as occasions for your inner reflection, and some day you will
find out who this beloved Tokimune of yours is.’
