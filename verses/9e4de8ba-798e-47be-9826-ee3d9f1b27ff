When the world follows the Way,
metals form plows and horses draw them.
When the world fails the Way,
metals form swords and horses bear them.

No chancre's more vile than craving,
no curse more viscious than discontent,
no crime more grievous than coveting.

How men suffer from want!ï¼š
want of knowing what suffices.
