Title: One Word
---
With only one word
You took the ice out of the air again
And put the heat back in the sun again
With only one word

With only one word
You put the weapons of the world away
It's funny how one single thing you choose to say
Will change the world and then
It suddenly means something better

Every single thing I see, good or bad
You make it mean something better
Every pleasure, every pain
Every nightmare that I dream
Make it mean something better

With only one word
You change the ending of a tragedy
And summon power from the injuries
With only one word
It's funny how one single thing you choose to say
Will change the world and then
It suddenly means something better

Every single thing I see, good or bad
You make it mean something better
Every pleasure, every pain
Every nightmare that I dream
Make it mean something better

Every time that I can't make a sound
And I think that I'm starting to drown
Even when I try to take you down
Every time that I think I'm alone
And I can't find a word of my own
You take me home
And then you change the world again

With only one word
You took a war out of my history
It's funny how one single thing you choose to see
Could change the world
And give mine back to me so much better

Every single thing I see (better)
Every single thing I dream (better)
So much better
Every pleasure, every pain (better)
Every nightmare that I dream (I dream)
Make it mean something better
