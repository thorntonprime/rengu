For a true and faithful servant of God shall be always pressing upward to what
is before him, not suffering himself to be held back by comfort or pleasure,
joy or sorrow, wealth or poverty. Through all this he shall urge onward, till
he come unto the infinite ocean of the Godhead. And therein he shall be lost
without his own knowledge, and dazzled by excess of light and love. There it
shall be given him to know all that belongs to true perfection.
