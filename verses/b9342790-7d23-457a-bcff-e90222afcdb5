No favour was left which that winsome beauty did not bestow.
What fault of ours, if he failed in bounty towards you?
Thou art reviling, because that charmer wrought tyranny;
Who ever saw in the two worlds a fair one that played not the tyrant?
His love is a sugar-cane, tho'he gave not sugar;
His beauty is perfect faith, tho'he kept not faith.
Show a house that is not filled by him with lamps,
Show a portico that his face filled not with loveliness.
When the spirit became lost in contemplation, it said thisï¼š
'None but God has contemplated the beauty of God.'
This eye and that lamp are two lights, each individual;
When they came together, no one distinguished them.
Each of these metaphors is at once an explanation and a misconception;
God revealed" By the morning splendour" in envy of the light of his
 countenance.
Never did the tailor, Destiny, to any one's measure
Stitch a shirt but he tore it in pieces.
The sun of the face of Shamsi Din, glory of the horizons,
Never shone upon aught perishable but he made it eternal.
