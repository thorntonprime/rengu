Title: Taking Political Action
---
Bright noon sun and warmth. I left the refectory early and, as I was hurrying
across the Night Pasture, I could hear the echo of Fr. Raymond’s urgent
shouts (he is reader in the refectory) relayed over a loudspeaker in the
empty barns and in the farm building. It is characteristic of us that all
our noise has to be heard everywhere.

To what extent is it simply a temptation for me to want to take some
political position, as distinct from an ethical one? Are the two separable,
for instance, where war is concerned? One thing is sure -- it is beginning
to be clear that opposition to nuclear war is something else than being
simply a “pacifist.” Also, opposition on the moral level demands some
kind of open expression of one’s position.

The question is -- how to clearly, definitely and openly make such a
stand without lending oneself to exploitation by one or another ofthe
big power groups?

Reading Chuang Tzu. I wonder seriously if the answer, the only possible
answer, does not lie hid far below the political and ethical levels. Ethics,
and politics, certainly, but only in passing, only as a “night’s
lodging”? When all action has somehow become absurd, shall one act merely
because at some other times action was once expected and significant? Like
setting the dinner table in a time of starvation when you have no food,
but setting it out anyway, out of habit?
