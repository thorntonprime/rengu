Kung-sun Lung said to Prince Mou of Wei, "When I was young I studied
the Way of the former kings, and when I grew older I came to understand
the conduct of benevolence and righteousness. I reconciled difference
and sameness, distinguished hardness and whiteness, and proved that not
so was so, that the unacceptable was acceptable. I confounded the
wisdom of the hundred schools and demolished the arguments of a host of
speakers. I believed that I had attained the highest degree of
accomplishment. But now I have heard the words of Chuang Tzu and I am
bewildered by their strangeness. I don't know whether my arguments are
not as good as his, or whether I am no match for him in understanding.
I find now that I can't even open my beak. May I ask what you advise?"
