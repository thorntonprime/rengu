    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: A Wonderous Knowing of the World
---
Sexual pleasure is no different from the sensory experience of pure looking or
the feel on the tongue of a luscious fruit; it is a wondrous knowing of the
world, given to us so that we may learn its fullness and radiance. The problem
is not our acceptance of it; the problem is that this experience is so often
misused and squandered. It is taken to enliven the deadened places of our
lives, to distract instead of heightening our awareness.

People have even made eating into something it is not meant to be. Experienced
as automatic impulse on the one hand, or as excess on the other, the nature of
this physical necessity is distorted, and similarly distorted are all the other
simple requirements for the renewing of life.
