Title: Drooling Is a Disadvantage
---
I know how most minds approach me for the first time, with caution. And that
 is wise. I prefer that behavior over someone drooling at me like a groupie.
Drooling is a disadvantage in public if one has healthy and reasonable
 ambitions in the world, as I like some of those close to me to harbor.
Accomplish something with your life; use all your wits and talents.
Every horse should be able to run full speed, and know all the beauty and
 wonder of its strength.
Win lots of trophies if you can before turning yourself out to pasture. And
 if anyone ever looks at them; O go ahead and tell the truthï¼š God spurred
 me, big time. I still have lots of bruises as proof.
