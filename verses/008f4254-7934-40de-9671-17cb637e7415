Or say they： He hath invented it? Nay, but they will not believe!
Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful.
Or were they created out of naught? Or are they the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they are sure of
 nothing!
Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord? Or have they been given charge
 (thereof)?
Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear
 (decrees)? Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest!
