As there are two kinds of sulphur, so there are two kinds of mercury,
the common mercury and the mercury of the Sages. Common mercury is
gross and crude; nor does it stand the test of fire like our mercury,
but is dissipated in the form of smoke, even by gentle heat. Hence the
Sages have laid down this rule： ‘Our mercury is not the mercury of the
vulgar herd.’
