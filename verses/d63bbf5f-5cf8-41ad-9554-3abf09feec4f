Title: Webbed Toes
---
This is not the right approach to the Way and its Virtue. Therefore he
who has two toes webbed together has grown a flap of useless flesh; he
who has a sixth finger forking out of his hand has sprouted a useless
digit; and he who imposes overnice ways, webs and forked fingers, upon
the original form of the five vital organs will become deluded and
perverse in the practice of benevolence and righteousness and overnice
in the use of his hearing and sight. Thus he who is web-toed in
eyesight will be confused by the five colors, bewitched by patterns and
designs, by the dazzling hues of blue and yellow, of embroidery and
brocade - am I wrong? So we have Li Chu.
