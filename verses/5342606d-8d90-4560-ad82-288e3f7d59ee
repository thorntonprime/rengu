Essential function of all the Buddhas,
Functioning essence of all the Patriarchs --
It knows without touching things,
It illmnines without facing objects.
Knowing without touching things,
Its knowledge is inherently subtle;
Illumining without facing objects,
Its illumination is inherently mysterious.
Its knowledge inherently subtle,
It is ever without discriminatory thought;
Its illumination inherently mysterious,
It is ever without a hairâ€™s breadth of sign.
Ever without discriminatory thought,
Its knowledge is rare without peer;
Ever without a hair's breadth of sign,
Its illumination comprehends without grasping.
The water is clear right through to the bottom,
A fish goes lazily along.
The sky is vast without horizon,
A bird flies far away.
