    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: The Books You Love
---
Live for awhile in the books you love. Learn from them what is worth learning,
but above all love them. This love will be returned to you a thousand times
over. Whatever your life may become, these books-of this I am certain-will
weave through the web of your unfolding. They will be among the strongest
of all threads of your experiences, disappointments, and joys.
