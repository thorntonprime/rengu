Since I came to Cold Mountain,
I've fed my destiny on mountain fruits.
What cares could there be in an ordinary life?
I'll simply follow mine through ...
Sun and moon move like a river,
light and dark; just sparks from stone.
I give you charge of all that changes, earth and sky.
I am become the pivot,
here sitting on this cliff.
