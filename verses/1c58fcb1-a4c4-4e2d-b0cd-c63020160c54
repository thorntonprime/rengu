Pauline had my most intimate confidence; she cleared up all my doubts.
One day I showed surprise that God does not give an equal glory in
heaven to all the elect; I was afraid that not all were happy.
Thereupon she had me bring Papa’s large glass, which she placed beside
my little thimble; then, filling them both with water, she asked me
which one appeared fuller. I told her that both seemed equally full,
and that it was impossible to pour in more water than they could hold.
Whereupon my ‘Little Mother’ had me understand that in heaven the
least of the elect would not envy the happiness of the highest. In
this way, putting the most sublime secrets within my reach, she gave
my soul the nourishment it needed.
