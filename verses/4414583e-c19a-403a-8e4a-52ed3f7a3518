Title: Fit For Emperors And Kings
---
Lao Tan said, "In comparison to the sage, a man like this is a drudging
slave, a craftsman bound to his calling, wearing out his body, grieving
his mind. They say it is the beautiful markings of the tiger and the
leopard that call out the hunters, the nimbleness of the monkey and the
ability of the dog to catch rats' that make them end up chained. A man
like this - how could he compare to an enlightened king?"
