Let only that little be left of me
whereby I may name You my all.

Let only that little be left of my will
whereby I may feel You on every side
and come to You in everything
and offer You my love every moment.

Let only that little be left of me
whereby I may never hide You.

Let only that little of my fetters be left
whereby I am bound with Your will,
and Your purpose is is carried out in my life --
and that is the fetter of your Love.
