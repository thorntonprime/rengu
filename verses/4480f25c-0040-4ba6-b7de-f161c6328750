Title: Beyond Love Stories (II)
---
Love flows down. The ground
submits to the sky and suffers what comes.

Is the ground worse for giving in like that?
Do not put blankets over the drum.
Open completely.

Let your spirit ear listen
to the green dome's passionate murmur.

Let the cords of your robe be untied.
Shiver in this new love
beyond all above and below.
The sun rises,
but which way does the night go?

I have no more words.
Let the soul speak
with the silent articulation of a face.
