In polite society everybody notices if a man’s hands are dirty. He’ll be
stared at contemptuously. Why, the fellow will be wretched until he can
wash his hands.

But isn’t it funny how a man can have character that’s defiled by greed and
hate and nobody will pay the slightest attention? He’ll move about in
perfect ease. Evidently, a dirty character isn’t worthy of notice as a
dirty hand.

It’s so simple to restore dirty hands to a state of purity. Just wash them.
But what about corrupted character? That’s quite another problem…
