Title: It Cuts the Plow Reigns
---
What does purity do? It cuts the plow reins. It keeps you from working and
 dining in the mud.
It frees you from living behind a big ox that bites.
What can purity do, my dear? It can lift your heart on a rising, bucking
 Sun that makes the soul hunger to reach the roof of creation.
It offers what the whole world wants： real knowledge and power.
It offers what the wise crave： the priceless treasure of freedom.
Pure divine love is no meek priest or tight banker;
it will smash all your windows and only then throw in the holy gifts.

It will allow you to befriend life and light and sanity and not even mind
 waking to another day.
It reveals the excitement of the present and the beauty of precision.
It confers vitality and a sublime clarity until finally
all the heart can do is burst open with great love and cheer!
O purity, O dear truth and friend within me, why didn’t you tell me sooner
 you could do all this --
cut the reins of illusion, so we can all just go wild, loving God and everyone
 all day!
