Title: Nothing Counts Except Love
---
One thing has suddenly hit me -- that nothing counts except love; that
a solitude that is not simply the wide-openness of love and freedom
is nothing. Love and solitude are the one ground of true maturity
and freedom. Solitude that is just solitude and nothing else (i, e.,
excludes everything else but solitude) is worthless. True solitude embraces
everything, for it is the fullness of love that rejects nothing and no one,
and is open to All in All.

After several days of rain the sky is clearing. Afternoons at the hermitage
become once again possible. I walked a bit in the woods, under the pines,
and again plan work, study, ideas, not to affirm myself but to give to
others. Anything I have that is good is worth sharing. What is not worth
sharing is not worth bothering about. What is “mine” is tolerated
only insofar as I am willing to share it with everybody.

I see this as ambiguous though. It needs qualification.

I have got to be faithful, detached, obedient, concerned not only for my
own life as I want to live it, but for God’s will, which remains to be
realized in and through me. That is all.
