It must be realized that the outward man is able to be active and leave
the inward man entirely passive and unmoved. Now in Christ too existed an
outward and an inward man and also in our Lady, and what Christ and our
Lady said concerning outward things was prompted by their outward man,
the inner man remaining in motionless detachment. So was it when Christ
said. â€˜My soul is sorrowful unto death.' And despite her lamentations and
various things she said. Our Lady, in her inner man, stood all the while in
motionless detachment. Take an illustration. The door goes to and fro upon
its hinges. Now the projecting door I liken to the outward man and the hinge
I liken to the inner man. As it shuts and opens the door swings to and fro
while the hinge remains unmoved in the same place without undergoing any
change. And likewise here.
