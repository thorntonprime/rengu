For they (the Pythagoreans) did not conceive that some things are
possible to the Gods, but others impossible, as those fancy who reason
sophistically; but they believed that all things are possible to the
Gods. And this very assertion is the beginning of the verses, which
they ascribe to Linus, and which are as follow：

  All things may be the objects of our hope,
  Since nothing hopeless any where is found：
  All things with ease Divinity effects,
  And nought can frustrate his almighty power.
