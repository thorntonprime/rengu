The only thing which a man must renounce if he wishes to attain the Supreme
Truth is the notion of individuality -- nothing else. ... A man who is entirely
free from the ego-sense is the happiest man in the world. Because, he has found
God -- absolute existence, consciousness and bliss -- in place of the ego.
