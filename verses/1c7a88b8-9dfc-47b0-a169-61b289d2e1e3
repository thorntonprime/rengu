You must know that the Perfect Man is a copy (nuskha) of God, according to the
saying of the Prophet, ‘God created Adam in the image of the Merciful,’
and in another hadith, ‘God created Adam in His own image.’ ... Further,
you must know that the Essential names and the Divine attributes belong to
the Perfect Man by fundamental and sovereign right in virtue of a necessity
inherent in his essence.
