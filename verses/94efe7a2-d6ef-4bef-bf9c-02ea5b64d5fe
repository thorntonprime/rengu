    Title: Religions, Values and Peak-Experience
By: Abraham H. Maslow
---
I have likened the peak-experience in a metaphor to a visit to a personally
defined heaven from which the person then returns to earth. This is like
giving a naturalistic meaning to the concept of heaven. Of course, it is
quite different from the conception of heaven as a place somewhere into
which one physically steps after life on this earth is over. The conception
of heaven that emerges from the peak-experiences is one which exists all
the time all around us, always available to step into for a little while
at least.
