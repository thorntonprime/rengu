Title: WHat the Prom Queen Gets
---
Time an enemy not easy to slay. It can tear the wing apart, sever it
with such an unclean cut one can bleed for days.

An hour is a clever hallucination, a year more so, a lifetime… the
grand hoax.

The way sound and light travel, the way all come from a source that
has never moved,

at the height of the action of longing or in the perfect resistance to
all the forces of morals… everything can stop.

That is where you want to be, where the clock's tyranny has lost its
influence.

One always gets a big prize for that—for any intelligent, overall
functional, useful deductions.

The door prize is, heaven wraps itself in a box and places itself at
your feet.

With such a door prize, try to imagine what the prom queen gets.
