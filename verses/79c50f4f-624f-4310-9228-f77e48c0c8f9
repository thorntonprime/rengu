In the last year of Yon-san terrible evils were abroad among the people. Such
wickedness as the world had never seen before was perpetrated, of which his
Majesty was the evil genius. He gave orders to his eunuchs and underlings
to bring to him any woman of special beauty. ...

In these days of trouble there was a young wife of a certain minister,
who was very beautiful in form and face. One day it fell about that she
was ordered into the Palace. Other women, when called, would cry and behave
as though their lives were forfeited, but this young woman showed not the
slightest sign of fear. She dressed and went straight into the Palace. King
Yon-san saw her, and ordered her to come close to him. She came, and then
in a sudden manner the most terrible odor imaginable was noticeable. The
King held his fan before his face, turned aside, spat, and said, “Dear
me, I cannot stand this one, take her away,” and so she escaped undefiled.

How it came about was thus： She knew that she was likely to be called
at any moment, and so had planned a ruse by which to escape. Two slices
of meat she had kept constantly on hand, decayed and foulsmelling, but
always ready. She placed these under her arms as she dressed and went
into the Palace, and so provided this unaccountable odour.

All that knew of it praised her bravery and sagacity.
