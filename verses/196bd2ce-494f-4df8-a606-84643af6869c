The happy life is thought to be virtuous; now a virtuous life requires
exertion, and does not consist in amusement. ...

If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable
that it should be in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will
be that of the best thing in us. ... This activity is contemplative.
