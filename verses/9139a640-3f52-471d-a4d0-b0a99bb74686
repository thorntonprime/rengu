Peace of heart is disturbed by passions; so if you do not allow passions to
approach the heart, it will always remain at peace. In the unseen warfare,
the warrior stands fully armed at the gates of the heart and repulses all
those who attempt to enter and disturb it. While the heart is at peace,
victory over the attackers is not difficult. Peace of heart is both the aim
of spiritual warfare, and the most powerful means to achieve victory in it.
So, when passionate turmoil steals into the heart, do not jump to attack the
passion in an effort to overcome it, but descend speedily into your heart and
strive to restore quiet there. As soon as the heart is quietened, the
struggle is over.
