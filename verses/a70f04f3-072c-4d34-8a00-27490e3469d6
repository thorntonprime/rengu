I am a dancer.

I believe that we learn by practice. Whether it means to learn to dance by
practicing dancing or to learn to live by practicing living, the principles
are the same. In each it is the performance of a dedicated precise set of
acts, physical or intellectual, from which comes shape of achievement,
a sense of oneâ€™s being, a satisfaction of spirit. One becomes in some
area an athlete of God.
