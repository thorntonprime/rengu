O kings, we have slain the outward enemy, but there remains within
(us) a worse enemy than he.

To slay this (enemy) is not the work of reason and intelligence： the
inward lion is not subdued by the hare.

This carnal self (nafs) is Hell, and Hell is a dragon which is not
diminished by oceans. It would drink up the Seven Seas, and still the
blazing of that consumer of all creatures would not become less. ...

It made a mouthful of and swallowed a whole world, its belly crying
aloud, 'Is there any more?’

God, from where place is not, sets His foot on it： then it subsides
at (the command) Be, and it is.

Inasmuch as this self of ours is a part of Hell, and all parts have
the nature of the whole.

To God (alone) belongs this foot to kill it： who. indeed, but God
should draw its bow? ...

Deem of small account the lion who breaks the ranks (of the enemy)：
the lion is he who breaks himself.
