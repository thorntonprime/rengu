There are some folks who're strict and straight,
but I'm not in the strict and straight cart.
Plain clothes making dancing easy,
and when the wine is gone you can
be drunk of singing!
Go for a full belly,
but don't wear your legs out looking for lunch ...
When the weeds grow out of your eye sockets,
you'll rue that day ...
