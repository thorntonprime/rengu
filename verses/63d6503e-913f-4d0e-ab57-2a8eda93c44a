Title: Kick Back and Say Ahhh
Description: September 15
---
The mind just wants to stop giving a shit about so many things.
It wants to kick back and say Ahhh more.
Not the kind of halfhearted ahhh one might muster upon request if a doctor
 just stuck a forklift down your throat.
There is a lot to a real Ahhh. I know you know that, and thus
you have your scouts out looking for “them,” basically 24-7. Yup, even
 in your dreams.
“Them,” of course refers to Ahhhhhhhhhs.
