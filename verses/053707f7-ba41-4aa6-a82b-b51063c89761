Tze Ch'i of Nan-kuo sat leaning on a table. Looking up to heaven, he
sighed and became silent, as though soul and body had parted.

Yen Ch'eng Tze Yu. who was standing by him. exclaimed. 'What are you
thinking about that your body should become thus like dry wood, your
mind like dead ashes? Surely the man now leaning on the table is not
he who was here just now.’

‘My friend.’ replied Tze Ch’i, ‘your question is apposite. Today I
have buried myself. ... Do you understand? ... Ah! perhaps you only
know the music of man. and not that of earth. Or even if you have
heard the music of earth, you have not heard the music of heaven.'
