When it comes to practicing with a prayer word or phrase such as the jesus
Prayer, the basic instruction couldn’t be simpler： at the time of prayer
let go of all other concerns, recollect yourself, and begin to repeat silently
the prayer word. Whenever you become aware that your attention has been
stolen, gently return your attention to the prayer word. Thus begins a
journey to the depth of the present moment that can never be fully fathomed.

 ...

There is nothing that separates us from this depthless depth whose ground
is God. Paradoxically, however, this is only seen to be the case after
crossing threshold after threshold. The present moment is a gateless gate
opening onto a pathless path. Such are the paradoxes and riddles that pave
the path of prayer.
