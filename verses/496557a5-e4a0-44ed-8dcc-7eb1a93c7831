Some contemplate one Name, and some another. Which of these is the best? All
are eminent clues to the transcendent, immortal, unembodied Brahma; these Names
are to be Void contemplated, lauded, and at last denied. For by them one rises
higher and higher in these worlds; but where all comes to its end, there he
attains to the Unity of the Person.
