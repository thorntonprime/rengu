If any one put into your hand a flint, and asked you to bring outward and
visible fire out of it for him, you would be unable to do so without the steel
that belongs to it, with which you would have to elicit the spark slumbering in
the stone. ... In the same manner, the heavenly light slumbers in the human
soul, and must be struck out by outward contact, namely, by the true faith,
through reading and hearing, and through the Holy Spirit whom Christ restored
to us.
