Without faith this world would come to naught in a moment, True faith is
appropriation of the reasoned experience of people whom we believe to have
lived a life purified by prayer and penance, Belief therefore in prophets
or incarnations who have lived in remote ages is not an idle superstition
but a satisfaction of an inmost spiritual want.
