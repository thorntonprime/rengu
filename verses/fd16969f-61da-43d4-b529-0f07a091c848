Title: Mecca and I Bump Heads
---
There are protective layers, veils between you and God's effulgence,
otherwise your face would appear singed, scarred from ecstasy as mine.
Such honorable wounds though, are bound to someday be yours.
If you looked close you would see my eyes are always folded in way, like
 hands praying.
The sun and the moon are my knees at hours, and the sky, the sky a prayer mat.
Mecca and I bow to each other and bump our heads, that is how close we are.
The ocean asks me to baptize it, when I walk along its body. And how can
 I resist?
I stopped exaggerating a couple years ago, when God and I did wed.
