Two birds, fast bound companions.
Clasp close the self-same tree.
Of these two, the one eats sweet fruit;
The other looks on without eating.

On the self-same tree a person, sunken.
Grieves for his impotence, deluded;
When he sees the other, the Lord (is), contented,
And his greatness, he becomes freed from sorrow.

When a seer sees the brilliant
Maker, Lord. Person, the Brahma-source.
Then, being a knower, shaking off good and evil,
Stainless, he attains supreme identity (sâmya) (with Him).
