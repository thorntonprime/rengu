Our existence as embodied beings is purely momentary; what are a hundred
years in eternity? But if we shatter the chains of egotism, and welt into
the ocean of humanity, we share its dignity. To feel that we are something
is to set up a barrier between God and ourselves; to cease feeling that
we are something is to become one with God.
