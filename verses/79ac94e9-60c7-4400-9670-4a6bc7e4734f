Title: There Is No Spot on Earth
Description: August 16
---
There is no spot on earth that ever became sacred until something danced
 there; maybe it was just an atom or two.
Strange now the seriousness I see around the shrines of perfect saints
whose feet once wept ecstatic tears as they moved upon the sun they saw
 beneath our every step.
There is no place in existence that ever became sacred until something
 sang there,
even be it just a molecule. That is enough. I hear they croon all the time.
