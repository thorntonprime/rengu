Music does not give rise, in the heart, to anything which is not already there;
so he whose inner self is attached to anything else than God is stirred by
music to sensual desire, but the one who is inwardly attached to the love of
God is moved, by hearing music, to do His will. ... The common folk listen to
music according to nature, and the novices listen with desire and awe, while
the listening of the saints brings them a vision of the Divine gifts and
graces, and these are the gnostics to whom listening means contemplation. But
finally, there is the listening of the spiritually perfect, to whom, through
music, God reveals Himself unveiled.
