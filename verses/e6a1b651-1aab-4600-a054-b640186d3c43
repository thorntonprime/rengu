Well, you see： once upon a time there was a blazing fire inside
me. The cold could do nothing against it, a youthfulness, a spring no
autumn could touch; a source of light, glowing wells of joy that seemed
inexhaustible. Not happiness, I mean joy, felicity, which made it possible
for me to live. ... There was an enormous energy there. ... A force ... it
must have been the life force, mustn’t it? ... And then it grew weaker
and all died away.
