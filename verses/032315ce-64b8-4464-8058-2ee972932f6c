Title: Somewhere It Is That's Overgrown
---
Somewhere it is that's
overgrown,
a convoluted mess
hiding what was planted
inside of me.

Something it is that's
tangled,
where mangrove and ragweed
obscure what still reaches
for light.

Someone it is that's
only God,
Origen says,
who nourishes and soaks
such struggling seeds.

Some day will be when
they'll poke their head
into sun and wind and
find a place, a glorious
place to be.
