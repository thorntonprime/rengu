Title: Using Mystery
Commentary: |
  A piece of sound tactical advice (practiced by the martial arts, such as
  Aikido, and by underground resistance and guerrilla forces), which leads
  to a profound moral warning. The prize thrown away by the aggressor is
  compassion. The yielder, the griever, the mourner, keeps that prize. The
  game is loser take all.

The expert in warfare says：
Rather than dare make the attack
I’d take the attack;
rather than dare advance an inch
I’d retreat a foot.

It’s called marching without marching,
rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles,
being armed without weapons,
giving the attacker no opponent.
Nothing’s worse than attacking what yields.
To attack what yields is to throw away the prize.

So, when matched armies meet,
the one who comes to grief
is the true victor.
