Title: Who should blame and condemn other men’s defaults
---
But I pray thee, of whom shall men’s deeds be judged?

Surely of them that have power, and cure of their souls： either given openly
by the statute and the ordinance of Holy Church, or else privily in spirit at
the special stirring of the Holy Ghost in perfect charity. Each man beware,
that he presume not to take upon him to blame and condemn other men’s
defaults, but if he feel verily that he be stirred of the Holy Ghost within
in his work; for else may he full lightly err in his dooms. And therefore
beware： judge thyself as thee list betwixt thee and thy God or thy ghostly
father, and let other men alone.
