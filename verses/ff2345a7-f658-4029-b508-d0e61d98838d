    Title: The Spiritual Crisis of Man
By: Paul Brunton
---
Like millions of trees which are all rooted in one and the same earth,
so millions of human minds are rooted in one and the same universal
being. Everything and every creature that is in the universe owes its own
being to the undifferentiated Being, Mind. If then we declare that there
is something godlike immanent in all men, we are not guilty of declaring
an absurdity. It is not enough for anyone to look at his body and say he
has seen a man. He must look also into the mysterious depths of his mind.
