Does anybody bake the sediment of sesamum oil in a vessel of lapis
lazuli or use as fuel thereof loads of sandal-wood? Does the seeker of
the fibre of the Arka plant plough the soil with ploughs having their
edges in gold? Does anybody cut down the branches of the camphor tree
to make out of them a fence to protect wild corn? The person who is
born as a human being and in this plane of action and is yet
unfortunate enough not to engage himself in penance does all these
things.
