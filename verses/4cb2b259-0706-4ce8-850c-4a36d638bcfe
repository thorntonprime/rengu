One day (Hasan of Basra) saw Râbi'a (al-'Adawiyya) near the riverside. Hasan
cast his prayer-mat, on to the surface of the water and said, ‘O Râbi'a, come
and let us pray two rak'as together.’ Râbi'a said. ‘O Hasan, was it necessary
to offer yourself in the bazaar of this world to the people of the next? This
is necessary for people of your kind, because of your weakness.’ Then Râbi'a
threw her prayer-mat into the air and flew up on to it and said, ‘O Hasan, come
up here that people may see us.’ But that station was not for Hasan and he was
silent. Râbi'a, wishing to gain his heart, said. ‘O Hasan, that which you did,
a fish can do just the same, and that which I did, a fly can do. The real work
lies beyond both of these and it is necessary to occupy ourselves with the real
work.’
