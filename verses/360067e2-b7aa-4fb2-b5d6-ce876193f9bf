Title: Conversation at Night
---
Do not go to sleep one night.
What you most want will come to you then
Warmed by a sun inside, you will see wonders.

Tonight do not put your head down.
Be tough, and strength will come.

That which adoration adores appears at night.
Those asleep may miss it.
One night Moses stayed awake and asked,
and saw a light in a tree.

Then he walked at night for ten years,
until finally he saw the whole tree illuminated.

Muhammad rode his horse through the nightsky.
The day is for work. The night for love.
Do not let someone bewitch you.
Some people sleep at night, but not lovers.
They sit in the dark and talk to God,
who told David, Those who sleep all night every night
and claim to be connected to us, they lie.

Lovers cannot sleep
when they feel the privacy of the beloved around them.

Someone who is thirsty may sleep for a little while,
but he will dream of water, a full jar beside a creek,
or the spirit water you get from another person.

All night, listen to the conversation. Stay up.
This moment is all there is.
Death will take it away soon enough.

You will be gone,
and this earth will be left without a sweetheart,
nothing but weeds growing inside thorns.

I am through.
Read the rest of this poem in the dark tonight.
Do I have a head, and feet?

Shams, so beloved by Tabrizians, I close my lips.
I wait for you to come and open them.
