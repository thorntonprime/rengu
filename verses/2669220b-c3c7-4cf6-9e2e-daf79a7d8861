But, O my muse! what numbers wilt thou find
To sing the furious troops in battle join’d!
Methinks I hear the drum’s tumultuous sound,
The Victor’s shouts and dying groans confound;
The dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies,
And all the thunder of the battle rise.
’Twas then great Marlborough’s mighty soul was proved,
That, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,
Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,
Examined all the dreadful scenes of war;
In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,
To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,
Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,
And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.
So when an angel, by divine command,
With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,
Such as of late o’er pale Britannia passed,
Calm and serene he drives the furious blast,
And, pleased the Almighty’s orders to perform,
Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.
