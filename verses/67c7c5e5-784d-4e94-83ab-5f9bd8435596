Verily, while he does not there see, he is verily seeing, though he does
not see (what is to be seen); for there is no cessation of the seeing of
a seer, because of his imperishability. It is not, however, a second thing,
other than himself and separate, that he may see.

  Verily, while he does not there smell, he is verily smelling ...
  Verily, while he does not there taste, he is verily tasting ...
  Verily, while he does not there speak, he is verily speaking ...
  Verily, while he does not there hear, he is verily hearing ...
  Verily, while he does not there think, he is verily thinking ...
  Verily, while he does not there touch, he is verily touching ...
  Verily, while he does not there know, he is verily knowing.
