Title: Relax and Live
---
Quiet, grey afternoon. It is warmer. Birds sing. There will be
more rain. Cocks crowing in the afternoon silence, very distant.

A thunderstorm. The first I have sat through in the hermitage. Here you
really can watch a storm. White snakes of lightning suddenly stand out in
the sky and vanish.

The valley is clouded with rain as white as milk. All the hills vanish.

The thunder cracks and beats. Rain comes flooding down from the roof eaves,
and grass looks twice as green as before.

Not to be known, not to be seen.

Father Gabriel Sweeney, the little white-haired Passionist who is in the
novitiate, who asked to leave before Easter, and was dissuaded by Reverend
Father, stands with a piteous expression in the novitiate library reading
Relax and Live. Sooner or later they come to that.

The evening sky over the valley. Long lines of clouds traveling in strong
cold wind toward the east.

Janua Coeliï¼š the Gate of Heaven. How different prayer is here at the
hermitage. Clarity -- direction -- to Christ the Lord for the great gift --
the passage out of this world to the Father, entry into the kingdom. I
know what I am here for. May I be faithful to this awareness.
