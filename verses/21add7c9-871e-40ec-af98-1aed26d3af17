“Bring hither a fig from there.” “Here it is, sir." “Break it.”
“It is broken, sir.” “What do you see there?” "These extremely
fine seeds, sir.” “Of these, please break one.” “It is broken,
sir.” “What do you see there?” “Nothing at all, sir.” Then
he said to Shvetaketu： “Verily, my dear, that subtle essence which
you do not perceive -- from that very essence, indeed, my dear, does
this great fig tree thus arise. Believe me, my dear, that which is the
subtle essence -- this whole world has that essence for its Self; that
is the Real; that is the Self; that art thou, Shvetaketu."

“Still further may the venerable sir instruct me.” “So be it,
my dear,” said he.

“Having put this salt in the water, come to me in the morning.” He
did so. Then the father said to him： “That salt which you put in
the water last evening -- please bring it hither.” Even having looked
for it, he did not find it for it was completely dissolved. “Please
take a sip of water from this end,” said the father. “How is it?”
“Salt.” “Take a sip from the middle,” said he. “How is it?”
“Salt.” “Take a sip from that end,” said he. “How is it?”
“Salt.” “Throw it away and come to me.” Shvetaketu did so
thinking to himself： “That salt, though unperceived, still persists
in the water.” Then Aruni said to him： “Verily, my dear, you do
not perceive Being in this world; but it is, indeed, here only： That
which is the subtle essence-this whole world has that essence for its
Self. That is the Real. That is the Self. That art thou, Shvetaketu.”
