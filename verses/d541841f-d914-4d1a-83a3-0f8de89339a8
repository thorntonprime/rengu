Such as these being captivated in the mystery of Babel, wonder only
after their beast Mammon, upon which they ride in pride, and scorn
anything but what pleases and flatters them in their admired works of
covetous iniquity, gilded over with seeming holiness. But the
Babylonish structure of their turba-magna-performances will fall, when
it has attained the highest limit of its constellation, and no wit of
man shall be able to prop it up. In the meantime the Antichrist in
Babel will rage and tyrannise, and execute the sentence of wrath, or
his own dismal doom, upon himself.
