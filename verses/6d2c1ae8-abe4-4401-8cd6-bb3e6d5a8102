I love the joys of the mountains
wandering completely free
feeding a crippled body another day
thinking thoughts that go nowhere
sometimes I open an old sutra
more often I climb a stone tower
and peer down a thousand-foot cliff
or up where clouds curl around
where the windblown winter moon
looks like a lone-flying crane
