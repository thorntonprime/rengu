  Body: This is not rodomontade. All great traditional rituals are
    sacramental representations of the nature of the universe.

There are three sources to Ritual. Heaven and Earth are the source of
its existence, our ancestors the source of its being in a class by
itself, sovereigns and teachers the source of its disciplinary power.
Without Heaven and Earth how could it have come to be?1 Without our
ancestors how could it have emerged? Without sovereigns and teachers
how could it have disciplined men? If any of these had been lacking,
there would not have been this pacifying influence among men. Thus it
is that there is Ritual, the ritual serving of Heaven above, of Earth
below, the reverencing of ancestors and the honouring of sovereigns
and teachers.
