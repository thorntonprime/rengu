Commentary: Citing a Sufi named Abû Muhammad Murta'ish.

\‘The Sûfî is he whose thought keeps pace with his foot’,1 i.e, he is
entirely present; his soul is where his body is, and his body where his soul
is, and his soul where his foot is, and his foot where his soul is. This is
the sign of presence without absence.
