Title: How Eternity Could Be Endured
Description: August 12
---
You must have seen yourself by now -- I mean the real Self. It must have at
 least passed close by one day, maybe even stepped on your toes. Or dragged
 you somewhere.
That Self, upon your seeing it, gave you the idea of how eternity could be
 endured, because of a
tremendous enchantment you felt for a grace emanating from all things,
 and your soul now the epicenter. Your own presence, upon every throne.
Such an incandescence you emanated, and so magnificently sovereign you felt,
 that rightfully,
rightfully, all your ideas of God would look very pale if they had the
 audacity to stand next to you, when your sight was clear ... and all your
 power revealed.
