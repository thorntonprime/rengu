Remember that God has put a mark upon us. consisting in our
shortcomings and diseases, to show to us that we have nothing to pride
ourselves about, and that nothing comes within the reach of our full
and perfect understanding; that we are far from knowing absolute
truth, and that our own knowledge and power amount to very little
indeed.
