Even if I go blind I will still see You.
Even if I become deaf, I will hear you.
Take away my feet
and I will still make my way to You.
Take away my arms,
and I will still embrace You.
Make my heart stop.
and my mind will take up its beat.
Consume me with fire and every drop
of my blood will become ablaze.
