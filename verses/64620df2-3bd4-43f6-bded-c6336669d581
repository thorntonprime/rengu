Hu Tzu said, "Just now I appeared to him as the Great Vastness Where
Nothing Wins Out. He probably saw in me the Workings of the Balanced
Breaths. Where the swirling waves gather there is an abyss; where the
still waters gather there is an abyss; where the running waters gather
there is an abyss. The abyss has nine names and I have shown him
three. Try bringing him again."
