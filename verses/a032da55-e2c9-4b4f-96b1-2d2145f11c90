The entire effort of our Soul is to become God. This effort is as
natural to man as that of flying is to birds. For it is inherent in
all men. everywhere and always; therefore it does not follow
the incidental quality of some man, but the nature of the species
itself.  ... For who implanted in our Souls this (tendency toward God)
but God Himself, whom we seek?
