Title: Three Treasures
Commentary: |
  The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me.

  The three final verses are closely connected in thought to the next two
  chapters, which may be read as a single meditation on mercy, moderation,
  and modesty, on the use of strength, on victory and defeat.

Everybody says my way is great
but improbable.

All greatness
is improbable.
What’s probable
is tedious and petty.

I have three treasures.
I keep and treasure them.
The first, mercy,
the second, moderation,
the third, modesty.
If you’re merciful you can be brave,
if you’re moderate you can be generous,
and if you don’t presume to lead
you can lead the high and mighty.

But to be brave without compassion,
or generous without self-restraint,
or to take the lead,
is fatal.

Compassion wins the battle
and holds the fort;
it is the bulwark set
around those heaven helps.
