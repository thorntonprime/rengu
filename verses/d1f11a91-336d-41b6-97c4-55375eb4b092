Abaris (was surnamed) a walker on air; because being carried on the dart
which was given to him by the Hyperborean Apollo, he passed over rivers and
seas and inaccessible places, like one walking on the air. Certain persons
likewise are of opinion, that Pythagoras did the same thing, when in the
same day he discoursed with his disciples at Metapontum and Tauromenium.
