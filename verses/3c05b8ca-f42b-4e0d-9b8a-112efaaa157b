Title: Love
By: George Herbert
---
Love bade me welcome： yet my soul drew back,
Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning
If lacked anything.

"A guest," I answered, "worthy to be here"：
Love said, "You shall be he.”
"I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,
Icannot look on thee."
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
"Who made the eyes but I?”
"Truth, Lord; but I have marred them; let my shame
Go where it doth deserve.”
"And know you not,” said Love, "who bore the blame?”
"My dear, then I will serve.”
"You must sit down,” said Love, "and taste my meat.”
So I did sit and eat.
