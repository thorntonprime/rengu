Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
The understanding of the men of ancient times went a long way. How far
did it go? To the point where some of them believed that things have
never existed - so far, to the end, where nothing can be added. Those
at the next stage thought that things exist but recognized no
boundaries among them. Those at the next stage thought there were
boundaries but recognized no right and wrong. Because right and wrong
appeared, the Way was injured, and because the Way was injured, love
became complete. But do such things as completion and injury really
exist, or do they not?
