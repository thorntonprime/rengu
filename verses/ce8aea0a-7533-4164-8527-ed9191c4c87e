The truth is that God alone is real and all else unreal. Men, universe, house,
children -- all these are like the magic of the magician. The magician strikes
his wand and says： 'Come delusion! Come confusion!’ Then he says to the
audience. ‘Open the lid of the pot： see the birds fly into the sky.’ But the
magician alone is real and his magic unreal. The unreal exists for a second and
then vanishes.
