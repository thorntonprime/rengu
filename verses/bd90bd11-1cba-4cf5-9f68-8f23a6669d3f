This just man cannot be hindered in his introversion, for he turns inward
both in fruition and in work; but he is like to a double mirror, which
receives images on both sides. For in his higher part, the man receives
God with all His gifts; and, in his lower part, he receives bodily images
through the senses. Now he can enter into himself at will, and can practise
justice without hindrance.
