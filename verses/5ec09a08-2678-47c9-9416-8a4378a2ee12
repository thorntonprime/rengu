Discard and confuse the six tones, smash and unstring the pipes and
lutes, stop up the ears of the blind musician K'uang, and for the first
time the people of the world will be able to hold on to their hearing.
Wipe out patterns and designs, scatter the five colors, glue up the
eyes of Li Chu, and for the first time the people of the world will be
able to hold on to their eyesight. Destroy- and cut to pieces the curve
and plumb line, throw away the compass and square, shackle the fingers
of Artisan Ch'ui, and for the first time the people of the world will
possess real skill. Thus it is said, "Great skill is like clumsiness."
Put a stop to the ways of Tseng and Shih, gag the mouths of Yang and
Mo, wipe out and reject benevolence and righteousness, and for the
first time the Virtue of the world will reach the state of Mysterious
Leveling."
