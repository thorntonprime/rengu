Title: Pleasure
---
My love, do you think I thrive, just as when you were here?
Then you can’t say you know me.

Since you went so far away, I haven’t had as much joy
  as the trace of a lone goose flying across the moonless sky.

When I look in the mirror, the smiles no longer come.
I no longer tend and water the flowering trees.
I hate even the sound of the quiet moon’s shadow
  that crosses softly over to my thin window.
I find no sweetness in the fresh grove
  after a shower overruns the scorching summer sky.
I have no companions or playthings.

Since you left, I have one bittersweet pleasure In this world：
that’s to cry my fill now and then.
