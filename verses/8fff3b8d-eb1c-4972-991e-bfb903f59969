That is one of the most lettings of grace, that a wretched man will
not acknowledge his own blindness for pride of himself; or else if he
knoweth it, he chargeth it not but maketh merry and game as he were
over all secure.

Therefore unto all these men that are thus blinded and bounded with
the love of this world and are so foul forshapen from the fairhead of
man, I say and counsel that they think on their soul, ... what
mischief and what peril it is to them for to be out of grace and
departed from God as they be; for there is nothing that holdeth them
from the pit of hell that they should not at once fall therein, but
one bare single thread of this bodily life whereby they hang. What
lightlier may be lost than a single thread may be broken in two?  For
were the breath stopped in their body, and that may lightly fall,
their soul should pass forth and anon be in hell without end.
