I had supposed that, having passed away
  From self in concentration, I should blaze
A path to Thee; but ah! no creature may
  Draw nigh Thee, save on Thy appointed ways.
I cannot longer live, Lord, without Thee;
Thy Hand is everywhere： I may not flee.

Some have desired through hope to come to Thee,
  And Thou hast wrought in them their high design;
Lo! I have severed every thought from me,
  And died to selfhood, that I might be Thine.
How long, my heart’s Beloved? I am spent;
I can no more endure this banishment.
