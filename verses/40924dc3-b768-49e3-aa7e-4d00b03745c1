Title: The Fellowship of Stars and Crows
---
Bright morning -- freezing, but less cold than before -- and with a hint of
the smell of spring-earth in the cold air. A beautiful sunrise, the woods all
peaceful and silent, the dried old fruits on the yellow poplar shining like
precious artifacts. I have a new level in my (elementary) star-consciousness. I
can now tell where constellations may be in the daytime when they are
invisible. Not many, of course! But for example： the sun is rising in
Aquarius and so I know that in the blue sky overhead the beautiful swan,
invisible, spreads its wide wings over me. A lovely thought, for some reason.

Since Hayden Carruth’s reprimand I have had more esteem for the crows around
here and I find, in fact, that we seem to get on much more peacefully.Two sat
high in an oak beyond my gate as I walked on the brow of the hill at sunrise
saying the Little Hours. They listened without protest to my singing of the
antiphons. We are part of a menage, a liturgy, a fellowship of sorts.
