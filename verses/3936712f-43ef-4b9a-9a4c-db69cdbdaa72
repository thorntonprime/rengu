Commentary: |
  [Regarding] Japa yajna, Burnell uses the word "muttering', but one knows how
  to wbigh the credentials of an orientalist w ho can write in his Introduction
  to this translation that the metaphysical systems of India possess nothing
  of permanent value, and vanish like mists before the sun when confronted
  with the results of positive science'.

All the Vedic rites, oblational and sacrificial, pass away; but this
imperishable syllable ôm is to be known to be Brâhma and also Prajâpati.

The sacrifice of invocation is said to be better by tenfold than the regular
sacrifice; if inaudible, it is a hundredfold better; a thousandfold, if mental.

The four household sacrifices accompanied by the regular sacrifices, all
those are not worth the sixteenth part of the sacrifice by invocation.

But by invocation even a Brahman (becomes), there is no doubt, perfect;
whether he perform anything else or not, a Brahman is called maitra (well
disposed to all things).
