Title: That a man should weigh each thought and each stirring after that
  it is, and always eschew recklessness in venial sin
---
I say not this for that I trow that thou, or any other such as I speak of,
be guilty and cumbered with any such sins; but for that I would that thou
weighest each thought and each stirring after that it is, and for I would
that thou travailedst busily to destroy the first stirring and thought of
these things that thou mayest thus sin in. For one thing I tell thee; that
who weigheth not, or setteth little by, the first thought -- yea, although
it be no sin unto him -- that he, whosoever that he be, shall not eschew
recklessness in venial sin. Venial sin shall no man utterly eschew in this
deadly life. But recklessness in venial sin should always be eschewed of all
the true disciples of perfection; and else I have no wonder though they soon
sin deadly.
