There is a country called Deccan, in which there is a monastery dedicated to
Kâsyapa Buddha, made by hollowing out a great rock. It has five storeys in
all. ... There are always Lo-han in residence here. The land is uncultivated,
and there are no inhabitants. Only at a great distance from the mountain are
there villages, all the inhabitants of which are pagans, and know nothing of
the Buddhist Faith, of Shamans, of Brahmans, or of any other of the heterodox
religions. They frequently see people come flying and enter the monastery;
and once when Buddhist worshippers came from the neighbouring countries to
pray at this monastery, one of the villagers asked them, saying, ‘Why do
not you fly here? The worshippers I see here, all fly.’ ‘It is because
our wings have not yet grown,’ replied the worshippers without hesitation.
