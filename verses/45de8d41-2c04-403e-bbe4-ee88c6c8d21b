Commentary: They alone can think that one would weary of a final beatitude or
  perfection who are unable to conceive of a felicity outside of time or
  space, and who therefore confuse the ecstatic instantaneity of an eternal
  now with the insufferable perpetuity of a ceaseless becoming.

  - Body: We arc never wearied of the daily rising and setting of the sun; we
      often demand "novelty" when our attention is distracted, but whenever we
      regard the realities of life, wc recognize that what we really need is
      not a perpetually "novel" but a constantly "original" (ex fonte)
      experience.

The desire of our mind is to live by mind, which is continually to enter more
and more into life and joy. But life and joy are infinite; and the blessed
are borne into life and joy by ardent desire. They who drink of the fountain
of life are satisfied in such fashion as still to thirst; and as this drink
never becomes a past thing, for it is eternal, ever are they blessed both
drinking and in thirst, and never shall that thirst and its satisfaction pass.
