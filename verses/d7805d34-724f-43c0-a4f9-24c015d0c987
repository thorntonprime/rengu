A magic force put to sleep by sin is latent in man. It can be
awakened by the Grace of God or by the art of the Kabbala. We will
find a pure and holy knowledge in us. if we manage to isolate
ourselves from all outward influence and allow ourselves to be led by
the inward light. At this stage of concentration the spirit
distinguishes each object on which it directs its attention, being
able to unite itself therein, and attain even unto God.
