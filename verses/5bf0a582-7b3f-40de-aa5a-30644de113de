Title: We All Know, Don't We
---
We all know, don't we, what St. Jerome
and other greats took for grantedï¼š
that each of us has from the start an
angel, or good spirit, and a devil,
inside? Virtue and heaven are
the angel's work, to incessantly
urge and prod, but wickedness and
waste are always the devil's domain.

An evil spirit, that devil, harps
and carps, sweet-talks and dialogues with
us, whispering true sweet-nothings to
the inner ear of every Adam
and every Eve leaning on a tree
flirting with a serpent's vain notions.
Be careful. There is another tree
you can't know but with the Noble Man.
