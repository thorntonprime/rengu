When I was young I studied books and
 swordsmanship
and rode off with a shout to the Capital.
There I heard the barbarians
had all been driven off already ...
There was no place left for heroes.
So I came back to these crested peaks,
lay down to listen to the clear stream's flow.
Young men dream of gloryï¼š
monkeys riding on the ox's back.
