If we really and truly understood what is our true personal dignity, we should
at once spring to our feet and change our very hearts and minds. We should
worship the three treasures and reverence the patriarchs. We should put filial
piety first and above all else. We should preserve that proper and respectful
love between husband and wife. We should be cordial in the courtesy of our
behaviour towards our brothers and friends. We should never forget our duty of
fidelity towards our relatives and neighbours. We should have compassion on the
sick and the poor. We should work with all our might for our home and family.
We should be obedient to the ordinances of our rulers. We should be merciful,
honest and patient, so as to be good examples to all men. Then without
appearing to instruct we should in the most natural way be able to act as
guides. Then all classes of the people would associate in peace. Everyone would
pass through life with smiling faces, co-operating with the Buddha and the Gods
of heaven and earth.

Then the eight million Gods, Bonten (Brahma), Taishaku (Indra), Daikoku,
Bishamon -- all of them would be a protection to you. Evil demons and false
gods would flee. There would be no sickness. The whole world would be at
peace. The five harvest grains would mature and every home be prosperous. The
children who were born would be good too.
