Title: Wine
---
I made wine from fragrant grapes ripened by autumn breeze
 and morning sun.
The perfume of fermenting wine dyes the fall sky.
I fill a lotus leaf with this wine and offer it to you.
Take it from my shaking hands and wet your parched lips.

If kept overnight, this wine will turn to tears.
After one night more, my tears will turn to new wine.
