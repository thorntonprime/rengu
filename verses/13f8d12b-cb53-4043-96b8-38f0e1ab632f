Love for God is naturally ardent and when it fills a man to overflowing, leads
the soul to ecstasy. Therefore the heart of a man who experiences it cannot
contain or bear it. but undergoes an extraordinary change according to its own
quality and the quality of the love which fills him; ... he is as one out of
his mind. A terrible death is for him a joy. and his mental contemplation of
heavenly things is never broken ... This spiritual intoxication was experienced
of old by Apostles and martyrs. The first travelled far and wide over the whole
world, working and suffering persecutions; the latter had their limbs cut off.
shed blood like water, but. suffering the most terrible tortures, never lost
courage and valiantly bore everything; being wise they were considered foolish.
Yet others wandered among deserts, mountains, caves and precipices of the
earth, remaining well-ordered amongst all disorder.  May God grant us such
disorder!
