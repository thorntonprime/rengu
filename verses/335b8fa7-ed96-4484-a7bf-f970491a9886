When a filial son does not fawn on his parents, when a loyal minister
does not flatter his lord, they are the finest of sons and ministers.
He who agrees with everything his parents say and approves of
everything they do is regarded by popular opinion as an unworthy son;
he who agrees with everything his lord says and approves of everything
his lord does is regarded by popular opinion as an unworthy minister.
But in other cases men do not realize that the same principle should
apply. If a man agrees with everything that popular opinion says and
regards as good everything that popular opinion regards as good, he is
not, as you might expect, called a sycophant and a flatterer. Are we to
assume, then, that popular opinion commands more authority than one's
parents, or is more to be honored than one's lord?
