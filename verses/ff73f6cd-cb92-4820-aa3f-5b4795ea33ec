If you are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if
you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances, your way
of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the Way. ... To practise
the six pâramitâs (Perfections) and a myriad similar practices with the
intention of becoming a Buddha thereby is to advance by stages, but the
Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of stages. Only awake to the One Mind,
and there is nothing whatsoever to be attained.
