Of old these possess Oneness：
Heaven because of the One is clear.
Earth because of the One is firm.
Powers because of the One have force.
Valleys because of the One are filled.
People because of the One subsist.
Rulers because of the One can govern.
The One creates these effects.
If heaven was not clear it might shatter.
If earth was not firm it might subside.
If powers had no force they might be exhausted.
If the valley was not filled it might run dry.
If people lacked subsistence they might perish.
If rulers could not govern they might fall.
So the superior has the inferior as root.
The higher has the lower at its base.
So rulers call themselves ‘abandoned, humble, and unfortunate’.
Is this not taking the inferior as root?
So the highest effect is not a burden,
Neither desiring to be rare like jade,
Nor solitary like a rock.
