Title: Constrained In Will
---
The man who owns a sword from Kan or Yueh lays it in a box and stores
it away, not daring to use it, for to him it is the greatest of
treasures. Pure spirit reaches in the four directions, flows now this
way, now that - there is no place it does not extend to. Above, it
brushes Heaven; below, it coils on the earth. It transforms and nurses
the ten thousand things, but no one can make out its form. Its name is
called One-with-Heaven. The way to purity and whiteness is to guard the
spirit, this alone; guard it and never lose it, and you will become one
with spirit, one with its pure essence, which communicates and mingles
with the Heavenly Order. The common saying has it, "The ordinary man
prizes gain, the man of integrity prizes name, the worthy man honors
ambition, the sage values spiritual essence." Whiteness means there is
nothing mixed in; purity means the spirit is never impaired. He who can
embody purity and whiteness may be called the True Man.
