Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention;
not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft;
not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of
 mind.

Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills
 their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.
He always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and
 ensures that the clever never dare to act.

Do that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.
