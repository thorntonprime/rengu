One evening. Dr Wm. Sanguinetti (faithful friend and personal physician of
Padre Pio) tells us that he and a few others were in Padre Pio’s room,
when the doctor opened the following conversation：

Dr： ‘Padre Pio, when God sends a saint, for instance like St Anthony to
another place by bilocation, is that person aware of it?’

Padre Pio： ‘Yes. One moment he is here and the next moment he is where
God wants him.’

Dr： ‘How is this possible?’

Padre Pio： ‘By a prolongation of his personality.’
