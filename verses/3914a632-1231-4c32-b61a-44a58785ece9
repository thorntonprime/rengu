Nothing in Washington’s military career shows the kindliness of his
heart and his indifference to personal autocracy more poignantly than an
overlooked little memorandum that he ordered destroyed. ... Realizing
that by going south he automatically superseded Greene in command and
robbed him of his independence, he tried to soften the blow by a personal
message sent with a letter of congratulation following Greene's success
at Eutaw Springs. ... This is the message：

“Col. Morris will inform General Greene in the sincerest manner that
there are but two motives which can possibly induce Genl. W[ashington]
to take the command to the southward： one, the order of Cornwallis]
to repair thither; the other, the French army going there. In the last
case Count R[ochambeau] would command if Genl. W[ashington] did not go
in person. General Washington wishes, not only from his personal regard
to Genl. Greene, but from principles of generosity and justice, to see
him crowned with those laurels which from his unparalleled exertions he
so richly deserves.”
