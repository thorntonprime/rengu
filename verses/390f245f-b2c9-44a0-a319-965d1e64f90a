He (the Pre-existent) is not an Attribute of Being, but Being is an Attribute
of Him; He is not contained in Being, but Being is contained in Him; He doth
not possess Being, but Being possesses Him; He is the Eternity, the Beginning,
and the Measure of Existence, being anterior to Essence and essential Existence
and Eternity, because He is the Creative Beginning. Middle, and End of all
things. ... He is not This without being That; nor doth He possess this mode
of being without that. On the contrary He is all things as being the Cause
of them all, and as holding together and anticipating in Himself all the
beginnings and all the fulfilments of all things; and He is above them all
in that He, anterior to their existence, super-essentially transcends them
all. Hence all attributes may be affirmed at once of Him, and yet He is no
Thing. He possesses all shape and form, and yet is formless and shapeless,
containing beforehand incomprehensibly and transcendently the beginning,
middle, and end of all things, and shedding upon them a pure radiance of
that one and undifferenced causality whence all their fairness comes.
