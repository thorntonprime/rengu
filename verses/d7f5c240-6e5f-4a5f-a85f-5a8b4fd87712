Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
Confucius stayed home for three months and then came to see Lao Tan
once again. "I've got it," he said. "The magpie hatches its young, the
fish spit out their milt, the slim-waisted wasp has its stages of
transformation, and when baby brother is born, big brother howls. For
a long time now I have not been taking my place as a man along with the
process of change. And if I do not take my own place as a man along
with the process of change, how can I hope to change other men?"
