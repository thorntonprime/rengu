In the Penitential Psalms, Christ recognizes my poverty in His
poverty. Merely to see myself in the psalm is a beginning of being
healed. For I see myself through His grace. His grace is working; therefore
I am on my way to being healed. O the need of that healing! I walk from
region to region of my soul and I discover that I am a bombed city.

When I meditated on Psalm 6 -- “Lord, not in thy fury” -- I caught sight
of an unexpected patch of green meadow along the creek on our neighbors
land. The green grass under the leafless trees and the pools of water after
the storm lifted my heart to God. He is so easy to come to when even grass
and water bear witness to His mercy. “I will water my couch with tears.”

I have written about the frogs singing. Now they sing again. It is another
spring. Although I am ruined, I am far better off than I have ever been
in my life. My ruin is my fortune.
