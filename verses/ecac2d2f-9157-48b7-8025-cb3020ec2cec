Title: Lying Beside My Wife
---
Once when I was awake and lying beside my wife, she whispered in her sleep,
 “Hafiz, I love you.”
I don’t think I would trade having heard her soul speak that way, even
 for all of heaven saying the same thing.
But is there a difference? I think loving is always God, showing us It is
 here, as much as the formless can reach into our world.
