Even the word “god” is being defined by many theologians today in such
a way as to exclude the conception of a person with a form, a voice, a beard,
etc. If God gets to be defined as “Being itself," or as “the integrating
principle in the universe,” or as “the whole of everything,” or as
“the meaningfulness of the cosmos,” or in some other non-personal way,
then what will atheists be fighting against? They may very well agree with
“integrating principles” or “the principle of harmony."
