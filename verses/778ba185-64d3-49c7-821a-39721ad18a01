The spiritual journey does not consist in arriving at a new destination where
a person gains what he did not have, or becomes what he is not. It consists
in the dissipation of one’s own ignorance concerning oneself and life,
and the gradual growth of that understanding which begins the spiritual
awakening. The finding of God is a coming to one’s self.
