In India we have got three millions of people who have to be satisfied
with one meal a day, and that meal consisting of a chapati containing no
fat in it and a pinch of salt. You and I have no right to anything that we
really have until these three millions are, clothed and fed better. You
and I, who ought to know better, must adjust our wants, and even undergo
voluntary starvation in order that they may be nursed, fed, and clothed.
