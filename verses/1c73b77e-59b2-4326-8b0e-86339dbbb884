I have come to You to take Your touch before I begin my day.

Ley Your eyes rest upon my eyes for a while.

Let me take to my work the assurance of Your comradeship, my Friend.

Fill my mind with Your music to last through the desert of noise.

Let Your love's sunshine kiss the peaks of my thoughts and linger in
  my life's valley where the harvest ripens.
