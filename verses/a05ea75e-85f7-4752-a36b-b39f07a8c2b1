By: John Smith the Platonist
---
We may also know God to be eternal and omnipresent, not because he fills
either place or time, but rather because he wanteth neither. ... And therefore
the Platonists were wont to attribute Αἰών or eternity to God, not so
much because he had neither beginning nor end of days, but because of his
immutable and uniform nature, which admits of no such variety of conceptions
as all temporary things do.
