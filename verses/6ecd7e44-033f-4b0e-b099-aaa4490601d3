When true sanctity and purity shall ground (a man) in the knowledge of divine
things, then shall the inward sciences, that arise from the bottom of his
own soul, display themselves; which indeed are the only true sciences; for
the soul runs not out of itself to behold temperance and justice abroad,
but its own light sees them in the contemplation of its own being, and that
divine essence which was before enshrined within itself.
