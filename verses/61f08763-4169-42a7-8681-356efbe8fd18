After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the sandhyâ (daily
worship) drop away. One day some people were sitting on the bank of the Ganges
performing the sandhyâ. But one of them abstained from it. On being asked the
reason, he said： ‘I am observing asoucha (temporary defilement upon birth
or death of a blood relative). I cannot perform the sandhyâ ceremony. In my
case the defilement is due to both a birth and a death. My mother, Ignorance,
is dead, and my son, Self-Knowledge, has been born.’
