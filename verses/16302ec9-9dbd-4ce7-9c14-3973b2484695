Title: Ten Thousand Dharmas Return to the One
By: Seki Seisetsu
Commentary: |
  The ability of calligraphy to emphasize certain words is especrally apparent
  in this single/column scroll by Seki Seitsetsu abbot and Zen master at
  Tenryu-ji in Kyoto during the second quarter of the twentieth century. The
  first character, “ten thousand" is created boldly in cursive script,
  with “flying white" as the brush rapidly ends the character. The second
  word. “dharmas” is more modestly expressed, but the third, “return”
  is boldly drawn down the length ofthe format, with its extended vertical,
  showing a strong use of flying white. Beneath it and to the left, the word
  “one" is short and stubby, and rendered in dark ink. Visually, Seisetsu
  stresses the activity of returning more than the unity at the end; as best
  our writing system can show it, he has written “Ten thousand dharmas
  return [to the] one."
