The spark of the soul, which is sent there by God ... is his light
striking down from above, the reflection (or image) of his divine
nature and ever opposed to anything ungodly; not a power of the soul,
as some theologians make it, but a permanent tendency to good; aye,
even in hell it is inclined to good. According to the masters, this
light is of the nature of unceasing effort; it is called synderesis,
that is to say, a joining to and turning from. It has two works. One
is remorse for imperfection. The other work consists in ever more
invoking good and bringing it direct into the soul, even though she be
in hell.
