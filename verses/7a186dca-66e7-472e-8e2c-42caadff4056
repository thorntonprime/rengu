My little sisters the birds, much are ye beholden to God your Creator, and
alway and in every place ye ought to praise Him for that He hath given you a
double and a triple vesture; He hath given you freedom to go into every place,
and also did preserve the seed of you in the ark of Noe. in order that your
kind might not perish from the earth. Again, ye are beholden to him for the
element of air which He hath appointed for you; moreover, ye sow not, neither
do ye reap, and God feedeth you and giveth you the rivers and the fountains for
your drink; He giveth you the mountains and the valleys for your refuge, and
the tall trees wherein to build your nests, and forasmuch as ye can neither
spin nor sew God clotheth you, you and your children; wherefore your Creator
loveth you much, since He hath dealt so bounteously with you; and therefore
beware, little sisters mine, of the sin of ingratitude, but ever strive to
praise God.
