Title: In My Glad Hours
Description: July 28

In my glad hours, I will make a city of your smile, a distant city that
shines and lives. I will take one word of yours to be an island on which
birches stand, or fir trees, quite still and ceremonial. I will receive your
glance as a fountain in which things can disappear and above which the sky
trembles, both eager and afraid to fall in.

I will know that all of this exists, that one can enter this city, that I have
glimpsed this island and know exactly when there is no one else beside that
fountain. But if I appear to hesitate, it is because I am not sure whether
it is the forest through which we are walking or my own mood that is shaded
and dark.

Who knowsï¼š maybe Venice, too, is just a feeling.
