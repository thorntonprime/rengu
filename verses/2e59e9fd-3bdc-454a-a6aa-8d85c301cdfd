  - Sacrifice-Death=Death=The Cycle of Births and Deaths
By: Hermes

The destruction of your bodies then will be the starting-point for a
rebirth, and their dissolution, a renewal of your former happiness.
But your minds will be blinded, so that you will think the contrary,
and will regard the punishment as a boon, and the change to a better
state as a degradation and an outrage. But the more righteous among
you ... look forward to the change.
