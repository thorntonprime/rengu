Title: All Day the Frogs Sing
---
As soon as I get into a cell by myself I am a different person! Prayer
becomes what it ought to be. Everything is very quiet. The door is closed
but I have the window open. It is warm -- grey clouds fly all night --
and all day the frogs sing.

Now it is evening. The frogs still sing. After the showers of rain around
dinnertime, the sky cleared. All afternoon I sat on the bed rediscovering
God, rediscovering myself, and the office and Scripture and everything.

It has been one of the most wonderful days I have ever known in my life,
and yet I am not attached to that part of it either. My pleasure or the
contentment that I may have experienced out of silence and solitude and
freedom from all care does not matter. But I know that is the way I ought
to be livingï¼š with my mind and senses silent, contacts with the world
of business and war and community troubles severed -- not solicitous for
anything high or low or far or near -- not pushing myself around with my
own fancies or desires or projects -- and not letting myself get hurried off
my feet by the excessive current of activity that flows through Gethsemani
with full force.
