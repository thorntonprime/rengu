People ask about the Cold Mountain wayï¼š
plain roads don't get through to Cold Mountain.
Middle of the summer, and the ice still hasn't
 melted.
Sunrise, and the mist would blind a hidden dragon.
So, how could a man like me get here?
My heart is not the same as yours, clear sir ...
If your heart were like mine,
you'd be here already.
