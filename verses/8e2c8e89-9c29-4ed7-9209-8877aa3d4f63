The practice of this (spagyric) Art enables us to understand, not
merely the marvels of Nature, but the nature of God Himself, in all
its unspeakable glory.  It shadows forth, in a wonderful manner, how
man is the image of the most Holy Trinity, the essence of the Holy
Trinity, and the Oneness of Substances in that Trinity, as well as the
difference of Persons; the Incarnation of the Second Person of the
Holy Trinity, His Nativity, Passion, Death, and Resurrection; His
Exaltation and the Eternal Happiness won by Him for us men; also our
purification from original sin, in the absence of which purification
all good actions of men would be vain and void -- and, in brief, all
the articles of the Christian faith, and the reason why man must pass
through much tribulation and anguish, and fall a prey to death, before
he can rise again to a new life. All this we see in our Art as it were
in a mirror.
