The pupils of the Tendai school used to study meditation before
Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends
promised one another to observe seven days of silence.

On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun
auspiciously, but when night came and the oil lamps were growing
dim one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant：
"Fix those lamps."

The second pupil was surprised to hear th first one talk. "We
are not supposed to say a word," he remarked.

"You two are stupid. Why did you talk?" asked the third.

"I am the only one who has not talked," concluded the fourth
pupil.
