Even though a hundred persons of great erudition predict failure, the wise
person who has confidence in this own abilities will persevere and succeed.
Even if these same hundred persons predict success, the person who has only
knowledge and not the self confidence born of wisdom will fail.

Book knowledge alone gives rise to doubts and doubts cause confusion. In
such conditions, no self confidence can develop. But wisdom leads to trust
and trust inspires insight and clear thinking. Dharma followers pursue the
path of wisdom in order to eliminate doubt and put knowledge to good use.
