\"Nim" is not only a human lover but eveything yearned for.
All beings are nim for the Buddha, and philosophy is the nim of Kant.
The spring rain is nim for the rose, and Italy is the nim of Mazzini.
Nim is what I love, but it also loves me.

If romantic love is freedom, then so is my nim.
But aren't you attacherd to the lofty name of freedom?
Don't you also have nim? If so, it's only your shadow.

I write these poems for the young lambs wandering lost
 on the road home from the darkening plains.
