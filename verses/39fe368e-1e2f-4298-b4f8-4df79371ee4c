All day I have waited for You
with my faculties still bleeding the poison of their suppressed actvity.
I have waited for Your silence and Your peace to staunch and cleanse them,
O my Lord.

You will heal me when You will,
because I have trusted in You.

I will not wound myself anymore with details with which I have
surrounded myself like thorns -- a penance that You do not desire of
me.

You have made my soul for Your peace and Your silence and my soul is
wounded with confusion, with the noise of my sins and my desires.
