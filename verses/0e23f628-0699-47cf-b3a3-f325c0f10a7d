Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher
---
\"Ah - we can never tell," said Hsu Y u. "I will just speak to you about
the general outline. This Teacher of mine, this Teacher of mine - he
passes judgment on the ten thousand things but he doesn't think himself
righteous; his bounty extends to ten thousand generations but he
doesn't think himself benevolent. He is older than the highest
antiquity but he doesn't think himself long-lived; he covers heaven,
bears up the earth, carves and fashions countless forms, but he doesn't
think himself skilled. It is with him alone I wander."
