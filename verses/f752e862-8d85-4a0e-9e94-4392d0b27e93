Hsu Yu said, "You govern the world and the world is already well
governed. Now if I take your place, will I be doing it for a name? But
name is only the guest of reality - will I be doing it so I can play
the part of a guest? When the tailorbird builds her nest in the deep
wood, she uses no more than one branch. When the mole drinks at the
river, he takes no more than a bellyful. Go home and forget the matter,
my lord.
