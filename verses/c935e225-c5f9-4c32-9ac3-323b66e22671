The great ancients have laid down：

This body of the Brâhmana is not given to him for the sake of sensuous
enjoyment. It is meant for undergoing great suffering in the world and for
leading to limitless happiness after death.'

It is therefore the duty of the Brâhmana to submit his body to suffering by
making it perform the several Karmas prescribed for him by the Sâstras Just
as the pleasure of tasting sweet sugar is possible only if the canes are
submitted to the crushing, so if we want lasting happiness the body must be
put to penance. If we hesitate to injure the sugarcane, there can be got no
sugar. The way therefore to attain happiness is by the performance of our
ancient Dharmas. We must not neglect them.
