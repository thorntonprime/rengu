And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God
gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient;

Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
malignity; whisperers,

Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of
evil things, disobedient to parents,

Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmerciful;

Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things
are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them
that do them.
