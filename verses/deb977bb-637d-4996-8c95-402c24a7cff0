Title: Don't Go
---
Those aren't love's wings that wrap themselves around the dear child,
snuggling in his mother's breast with pursed lips
  in the exprctation of sweetness;
it's the flag of the enemy.
That's not the light of compassion from Buddha's brow;
It's the flash from a demon's eyes.
That's not the goddess of love who binds body and mind,
and tosses herself into love's ocean, caring nothing
  for crowns, glory, or death;
It's the smile of the knife.
My love, you thirst for satisfaction.
Turn around -- don't go to that place. I hate it.

The earth's music falls asleep in the Rose of Sharon's shadow.
The dream of prosperity dives deep into the black ocean.
The frightening silence imparts the knife-sharp sermons
  of the whispering universe.
My love, you want to get drunk on the bloom of new life.
Turn around -- don't go to that place. I hate it.

Where is the lovely girl who takes the angel-blessed children,
places her own life in them and offers them on love's altar?
Where is the strange lily that offers its sweet and clear perfume
to one honeybee and denies it to the other?
Where is the firefly that buries itself in death's green mountain
and cuts the night in two with its flowing light?
My love, you are ready to die for you passion.
Turn back -- don't go to that place. I hate it.

In that land, there is no sky.
In that land, shadowless people war.
In that land, the measureless rhythm of great time
  and the key to creation stops.
My love, you claim that death is fragrant.
Turn back -- don't go to that place. I hate it.
