Reduce the size of the population and the state.
Ensure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a
 battalion they will not use them;
And also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they
 look on death as no light matter.

Even when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;
And even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to
 make a show of them.

Bring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,
Will find relish in their food
And beauty in their clothes,
Will be content in their abode
And happy in the way they live.

Though adjoining states are within sight of one another,
And the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard
 in another,
yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any
 dealings with those of another.
