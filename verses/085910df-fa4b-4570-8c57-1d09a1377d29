We all have a tendency to like those who listen to our advice and to
dislike those who ignore it. We should guard ourselves against this
tendency.

If we allow our emotions to influence us, we’re guilty of ignoring the
Dharma’s advice. Love and hate can infect consciousness and jeopardize our
ability to perceive clearly, to see with unprejudiced eyes. In the darkness
we may stumble. When we control our emotions, we preserve the light.
