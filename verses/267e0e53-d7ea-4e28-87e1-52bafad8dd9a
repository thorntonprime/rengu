Nature is indifferent,

respecting all creation as straw dogs.
Wise men are indifferent,
respecting all that humans do as straw dogs.

The hollow between heaven and earth,
how like a bellows it isï¼š
empty, yet inexhaustible.
The more it empties, the more it gives.

Words fill space needlessly.
Hold fast to the center.
