Zen story：

A monk said to Ioshu： “What is the way?”

Joshu replied： “Outside the fence.”

The monk insisted： “I mean the Great Way? What is the Great Way?”

Joshu replied： “The Great Way is that which leads to the Capital.”

The Great Way is right in the middle ofthe story, and I should remember it
when I get excited about war and peace. I sometimes think I have an urgent
duty to make all kinds ofprotest and clarification -- but, above all, the
important thing is to be on the Great Way and stay on it, whether one speaks
or not. It is not necessary to run all over the countryside shouting “peace,
peace!” But it is essential to stay on the Great Way which leads to the
Capital, for only on the Great Way is there peace. Ifno one follows the way,
there will be no peace in the world, no matter how much men may preach it.

It is easy to know that “there is a way somewhere,” and even perhaps
to know that others are not on it (by analogy with one’s own lostness,
wandering far from the way). But this knowledge is useless unless it helps
one find the way.
