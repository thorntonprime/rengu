Churches, mosques and temples which cover so much hypocrisy and humbug
and shut the poorest out of them seem but a mockery of God and His worship
when one sees the eternally renewed temple of worship under the vast blue
canopy inviting every one of us to real worship, instead of abusing His
name by quarrelling in the name of religion.
