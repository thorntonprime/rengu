\"That's all there is to it," said Confucius. "Now I will tell you. You
may go and play in his bird cage, but never be moved by fame. If he
listens, then sing; if not, keep still. Have no gate, no opening,  but
make oneness your house and live with what cannot be avoided. Then you
will be close to success.
