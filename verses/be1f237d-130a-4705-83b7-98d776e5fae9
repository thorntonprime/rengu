Title: An Exquisite Truth
---
This is an exquisite truth：
Saints and ordinary folks are the same from the start.
Inquiring about a difference
Is like asking to borrow string
When you’ve got a good strong rope.
Every Dharma is known in the heart.
After a rain, the mountain colors intensify.
Once you become familiar with the design of fate’s illusions
Your ink-well will contain all of life and death.
