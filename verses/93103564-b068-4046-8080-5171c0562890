Title: If What You Say Becomes Memorable
---
Most that is said is really like a distant echo. Few minds are strong enough,
free enough of prejudice and arrogance for original thought to want to
 pass through.
The body is like a vase, a bell that can chime. It does so to varying degrees
 in response to every experience and feeling.
The value of vases can differ, as you know, quite a bit.
How does heaven assign worth to our sounds? It comes down to thisï¼š
If what you say or do becomes memorable to another in times of need,
an ally are you then considered by the gods.
