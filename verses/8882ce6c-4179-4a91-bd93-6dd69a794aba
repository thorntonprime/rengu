In governing men and serving heaven,
nothing exceeds economy.

Through economy,
one pursues the Way anew.
Following from the start
means ever more integrity.
With a reservoir of integrity,
no challenge is too great.
When nothing blocks the way,
one knows no limits.
A man without limit
is fit to lead all.
As a font for all,
he long endures.
Such is rooting deeply and growing firm,
the Way of long life and lasting vision.
