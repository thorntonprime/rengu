Title: Mending The Inborn Nature
---
THOSE WHO SET ABOUT MENDING the inborn nature through vulgar learning,
hoping thereby to return once more to the Beginning; those who set
about muddling their desires through vulgar ways of thought, hoping
thereby to attain clarity - they may be called the blind and benighted
people.
