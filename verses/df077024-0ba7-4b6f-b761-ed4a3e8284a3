Fear of man and fear of God cannot coexist in one heart!

The wise follow the path of non-assertion and teach without
words. -- Lao Tzu

Beauty and necessity (for me) of the solitary life -- apparent in the
sparks of truth, small, recurring flashes of a reality that is beyond
doubt, momentarily appearing, leading me further on my way. Things that
need no explanation and perhaps have none, but which say： “HIere! This
way."’And with final authority.

It is for them that I will be held responsible. Nothing but immense
gratitude! They cancel out all my mistakes, weaknesses, evasions,
falsifications.

They lead further and further in that direction that has been shown me
and to which I am called.
