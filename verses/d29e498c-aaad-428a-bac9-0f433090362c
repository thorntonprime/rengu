Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal

Once a man receives this fixed bodily form, he holds on to it, waiting
for the end. Sometimes clashing with things, sometimes bending before
them, he runs his course like a galloping steed, and nothing can stop
him. Is he not pathetic? Sweating and laboring to the end of his days
and never seeing his accomplishment, utterly exhausting himself and
never knowing where to look for rest - can you help pitying him? I'm
not dead yet! he says, but what good is that? His body decays, his mind
follows it - can you deny that this is a great sorrow? Man's life has
always been a muddle like this. How could I be the only muddled one,
and other men not muddled?
