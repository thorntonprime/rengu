Title: Here and Now
---
Everything hangs on the little word
bore and its sibling now, but I often

forget this, keeping busy with my
plans, building for a future I cannot

know and against worries I cannot
finally tame, and yet You wait

for me to come home to Your now
which is beyond past and future,

and return to Your bore which is
present before beginning and

beyond every ending.
