When we invoke the Buddha, he gives us light. When his light shines
upon us, all our sins melt away. As the fabled ‘tree of the drug king’
turns everything that touches it, even poisonous substances, into
healing drugs, so will there be nothing of sin remaining in him upon
whom the light of the Buddha falls.
