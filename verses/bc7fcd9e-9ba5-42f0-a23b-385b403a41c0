Title: There Is a Face Here
Description: September 10
---
Who would want to leave your side, God, and cause mischief, when you act
 like that?
Donâ€™t you know you could bring an end to all the pillaging, and so much
 suffering,
if you just walked through the streets looking at everyone, as you often
 now do toward me?
There is an enchanting face here, between these words, if you can slow
 down enough
you will see me, beholding you, beholding you, in such an extraordinary way.
