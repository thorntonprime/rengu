Title: Nameless in My Name
---
You are the One who is in-yet-beyond
the many, Light burning in darkness

and Darkness shining beyond light,
the Good beyond all that is evil, and

the Nothing radiant in all things,
the nameless One in all we name

and the origin that gathers in the end
and is active in every beginning,

the One in my many, Light in my dark,
Dark in my light, Good in my evil and

Nothing in my all, nameless in my
name and Beginning in my end.
