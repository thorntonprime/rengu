Light up thy lantern and see in this image five windows by the which sin
cometh into thy soul, as the prophet saithï¼š Mors ingreditur per fenestras
nostras. Death cometh in by our windows. These windows are our five wits, by
the which thy soul goeth out from himself and seeketh his delight and his
feeding in earthly things, against his own kind; as by the eye for to see
curious and fair things, by the ear for to hear wondrous and new tidings, and
so of the other wits. By the unreasonable using of these wits unto vanity
wilfully, thy soul is mickle letted from the ghostly wits within; therefore
thee behoveth stop the windows and shut them, but only when need asketh for
to open them. And that were little mastery if thou mightest once see thy soul
by clear understanding, what it is, and how fair it is in his own kind, were
not that it is overlaid with a black mantle of this foul image.
