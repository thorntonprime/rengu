\"When men get together to pit their strength in games of skill, they
start off in a light and friendly mood, but usually end up in a dark
and angry one, and if they go on too long they start resorting to
various underhanded tricks. When men meet at some ceremony to drink,
they start off in an orderly manner, but usually end up in disorder,
and if they go on too long they start indulging in various irregular
amusements. It is the same with all things. What starts out being
sincere usually ends up being deceitful. What was simple in the
beginning acquires monstrous proportions in the end.
