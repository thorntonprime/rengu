A rich man asked Sengai to write something for the continued
prosperity of his family so that it might be treasured from
generation to generation.

Sengai obtained a large sheet of paper and wroteï¼š "Father dies,
son dies, grandson dies."

The rich man became angry. "I asked you to write something for
the happiness of my family! Why do you make such a joke as
this?"

"No joke is intended," explained Sengai. "If before you yourself
die you son should die, this would grieve you greatly. If your
grandson should pass away before your son, both of you would be
broken-hearted. If your family, generation after generation,
passes away in the order I have named, it will be the natural
course of life. I call this real prosperity."
