Description: Instructions for an anchoress
---
And therefore whoso will speak with thee, what that he be. in what degree that
he be.  and thou know not what he is nor why he cometh, be soon ready with a
good will for to wit what his will is. ... And though thou be in prayer or
devotion, that thee thinketh loath for to break off, for thee thinketh thou
shouldest not leave God for man’s speech, me thinketh not so in this case： for
if thou be wise thou shalt not leave God but thou shalt find Him and have Him
and see Him in thine even-christian as well as in prayer, but in another manner
thou shalt have Him than in prayer.
