---
He who knows men is clever;
He who knows himself has insight.
He who conquers men has force;
He who conquers himself is truly strong.

He who knows when he has got enough is rich,
And he who adheres assiduously to the path of Tao is a man of steady
 purpose.
He who stays where he has found his true home endures long,
And he who dies but perishes not enjoys real longevity.
