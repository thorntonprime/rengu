Title: Love
---
\ O nectar! O delicious stream!
O ravishing and only pleasure! Where
  Shall such another theme
Inspire my tongue with joys or please mine ear!
  Abridgement of delights!
  And Queen of sights!
O mine of rarities! O Kingdom wide!
O more! O cause of all! O glorious Bride!
  O God! O Bride of God! O King!
  O soul and crown of everything!

  Did not I covet to behold
Some endless monarch, that did always live
  In palaces of gold,
Willing all kingdoms, realms, and crowns to give
  Unto my soul! Whose love
  A spring might prove
Of endless glories, honours, friendships, pleasures,
Joys, praises, beauties and celestial treasures!
  Lo, now I see there’s such a King.
  The fountain-head of everything!

  Did my ambition ever dream
Of such a Lord, of such a love! Did I
  Expect so sweet a stream
As this at any time! Could any eye
  Believe it? Why all power
  Is used here;
Joys down from Heaven on my head do shower,
And Jove beyond the fiction doth appear
  Once more in golden rain to come
  To Danae’s pleasing fruitful womb.

  His Ganymede! His life! His joy!
Or He comes down to me, or takes me up
  That I might be His boy,
And fill, and taste, and give, and drink the cup.
  But those (tho’ great) are all
  Too short and small,
Too weak and feeble pictures to express
The true mysterious depths of Blessedness.
  I am His image, and His friend,
  His son, bride, glory, temple, end.
