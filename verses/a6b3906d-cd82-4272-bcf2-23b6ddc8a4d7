Last night I had a haunting dream of a Chinese princess which stayed with
me all day. ("Proverb" again.) This lovely and familiar and archetypal
person. (No "object" yet how close and real, and how elusive.) She comes
to me in various mysterious ways in my dreams. This time she was with her
"brothers," and I felt overwhelmingly the freshness, the youth, the wonder,
the truth of her, her complete reality, more real than any other, yet
unobtainable. Yet I deeply felt the sense of her understanding, knowing and
loving me, in my depths -- not merely in my individuality and everyday self,
yet not as igf this self were utterly irrelevant to her. (Not rejected,
not accepted either.)
