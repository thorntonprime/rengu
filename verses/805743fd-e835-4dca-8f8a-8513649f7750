Title: As If God Had Been Lost
---
Ask yourself, dear Mr. Kappus, if you really have lost God. Is it not rather
the case that you have never yet possessed him? When would that have taken
place? ... Do you imagine that someone who really had him could lose him
like a little stone, or that one who possessed him could ever be lost by
him? And if you are terrified that he does not exist, at this very moment
we speak of him, what reason do you, if he never existed, for missing him
and seeking him as if he had been lost?
