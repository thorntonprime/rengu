Description: Egyptian Tradition
Format: verse
---
I live as I please, I wander where I like;
I go in and out each day according to my pleasure;
I move where my inclination leads me;
I assume all the forms which it pleases me to assume;
I hold in my right hand the Lapis stone;
I wear in my right ear the Flower of Ankham for ornament;
I am flourishing, I am prosperous;
I am a perennial youth in the garden of immortality.
