Spare words; nature's way. Violent winds do not blow all morning. Sudden
 rain cannot pour all day.
What causes these things? Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not blow
 and pour for long, How much less should humans?
Therefore in following Tao： Those on the way become the way, Those who gain
 become the gain, Those who lose become the loss.
All within the Tao： The wayfarer, welcome upon the way, Those who gain,
 welcome within gain, Those who lose, welcome withon loss.
Without trust in this, There is no trust at all.
