Title: He Belonged in a Morgue
Description: June 28
---
He looked like he belonged in a morgue three days ago, an old neighbor of mine.
 Then a young woman moved in with him.
They were up till 3ï¼š00 a.m, last night rocking the walls. A week from now he
 may look worse off than when this tale began.
But for the moment I am glad things are going well. Maybe there are some clues
 here to help enliven you?
And in case you have noticed, I know I have discussed this matter before. It
 just seems to keep coming up.
