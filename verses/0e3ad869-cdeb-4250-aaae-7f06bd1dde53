God allows the intelligent philosopher to bring forth hidden
things through meditation on nature, and to liberate them from the
darkness.  ... These hidden realities are always present, but the
eyes of ordinary men do not see them -- only the eyes of the
intellect and of the power of imagination which perceive with a true
vision.
