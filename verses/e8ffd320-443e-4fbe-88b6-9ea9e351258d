\"From the point of view of function, if we regard a thing as useful
because there is a certain usefulness to it, then among all the ten
thousand things there are none that are not useful. If we regard a
thing as useless because there is a certain uselessness to it, then
among the ten thousand things there are none that are not useless. If
we know that east and west are mutually opposed but that one cannot do
without the other, then we can estimate the degree of function.
