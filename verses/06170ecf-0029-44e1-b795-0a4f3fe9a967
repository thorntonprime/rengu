Title: Whether Your Destiny Is Glory or Disgrace
---
Whether your destiny is glory or disgrace,
Purify yourself of hatred and love of self.
Polish your mirror, and that sublime Beauty
From the regions of mystery
Will flame out in your heart
As it did for the saints and prophets.
Then, with your heart on fire with that Splendor,
The secret of the Beloved will no longer be hidden.
