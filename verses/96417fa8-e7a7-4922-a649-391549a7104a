For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not
thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it
may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater;

So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return
unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall
prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
