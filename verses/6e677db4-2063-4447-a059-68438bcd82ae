When you meditate or affirm, deny the three bodies and identify yourself
with the Essence which dwells in you. Reject names and forms; do not confuse
the physical body, or the mind, or the breath (prâna), the understanding,
or the sense organs (indriyas) with the pure eternal Atman. The supreme Self
is entirely distinct from all these ‘vehicles’ or products of illusion
(Mâyâ).
