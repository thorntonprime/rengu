  Title: Meister Eckhart

When an artist makes a sculpture out of wood or stone,
he does not put his idea into the wood but,
rather, he chips away the material that has been hiding it.
He does not impart something to the wood
but cuts to covering away and removes the tarnish
so that what was hidden there may shine.

That to which the soul inclines tends to be like a veil;
bit in being lifted up,
the soul is made naked before the idea of God,
for God's begetting;
the image of God is unveiled and free
in the open soul of the wise;
and the Son of God,
the seed of the divine nature
is not extinguished even though it be covered up.

The true light shines in the darkness
even though no one is aware of it.
