Commentary: |
  \'In Sumatra, as well as in some of the other islands of the Dutch East
  Indies, there are some teachers of mysticism who have become so advanced
  that they say it is no longer necessary to pray aloud; for them the secret
  prayer of the heart is sufficient. ... Some mystics go so tar as to say
  that this complete consciousness of the universal unity is in itself a
  universal prayer which does away with the necessity for the five daily
  devotional exercises of ordinary men' (R. L. Archer： 'Muhammadan Mysticism
  in Sumatra"： Journal Malayan Branch B oyal Asiatic Society, Singapore.
  Sept., 1937, pp. 91-92)

Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity, but verily remembrance
(invocation) of Allâh is greatest.
