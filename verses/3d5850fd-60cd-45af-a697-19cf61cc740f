All that we are is the result of what we have thought： it is founded
on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the
foot of the ox that draws the carriage.

All that we are is the result of what we have thought： it is founded
on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or
acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that
never leaves him.
