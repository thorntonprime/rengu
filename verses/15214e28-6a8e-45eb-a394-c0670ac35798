Title: Sigh and Giggle
---
When was the last time you wallowed in contentment,

maybe lay in bed for two days just making your lover sigh and giggle, and she

and you talked silliness for hours and joked at the sweet insignificance of
  most all stuff?

Cuddle up with the stars more. You will be able to do that

if you can start treating every human being as a sacred cow,

and keep a few of my poems handy
