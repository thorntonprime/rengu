When we have no aim but God, nothing can part us from Him, or lead us
astray. ...

The vine-dresser loves to strip off the leaves, that thus the sun may
have nothing to hinder its rays from pouring on the grapes. In like
manner do all means of grace fall away from this (God-loving) man,
such as images of the saints, teachings, holy exercises, set prayers,
and the like. Yet let none cast these things aside before they fall
away of themselves through divine graceï¼š that is to say, when a man is
drawn up above all that he can comprehend.
