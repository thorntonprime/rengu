If sons and daughters of good family wish to enter upon the Samâdhi of
Oneness, let them sit in a solitary place, abandon all thoughts that are
disturbing, not become attached to forms and features, have the mind fixed on
one Buddha, and devote themselves exclusively to reciting (ch'eng) his name
(ming, nâmadheya), sitting in the proper style in the direction where the
Buddha is, and facing him squarely.
