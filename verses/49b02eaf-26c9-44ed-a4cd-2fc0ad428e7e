Title: Bringing You Up to Date
---
A student of mine who had lost his father at an early age, and had no uncles
 or older brothers, was getting married soon.
And he had never been with a woman before, so he came to me for advice. He
 shyly, though directly, addressed the matter, saying,
"Hafiz, just tell me all I need to know."
I went into some detail about the situation and even diagrammed a few key
 points on paper, knowing I was something of an expert, and feeling that my
 wife would wholeheartedly agree.
Tell me all I need to know, I think I heard your heart say, dear world,
 about various concerns, and your pending wedding night with God.
So I have been trying to bring you up to date ... the best I can.
