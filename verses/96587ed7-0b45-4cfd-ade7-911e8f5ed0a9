Title: Happiness
---
I love you and I love your happiness.
I want everyone to love you and love your happiness.
And yet, I would hate the person who loves you too.
Hating that person is one part of my love for you.
And so, the pain of hating is my happiness.

If everyone in the world were to hate you,
I would hate them beyond measure.
If everyone in the world neither loved nor hated you,
that would be my unbearable pain.
If everyone in the world hated me because they loved you,
my happiness couldnâ€™t be greater.
The deeper their hate for me, the greater my love for you.
