  Title: God Makes the Rivers Flow
Title: One with God
---
Whoever has God in mind,
simply and solely God, in all things,
such a man carries God with him into all his works
and into all places,
and God alone does all his works.
Hee seeks nothing but God,
nothing seems good to him but God.
He Becomes one with God in every thought.
Just as no multiplicity can dissipate God,
so nothing can dissipate this man or make him multiple.
