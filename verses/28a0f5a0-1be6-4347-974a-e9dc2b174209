You may know with the utmost certainty that, if you have no inward
peace, if religious comfort is still wanting, it is because you have
more wills than one.  For the multiplicity of wills is the very
essence of fallen nature, and all its evil, misery and separation from
God lies in it; and as soon as you return to and allow only this one
will, you are returned to God and must find the blessedness of His
kingdom within you.
