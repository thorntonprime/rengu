Banish learning, no more grief. Between Yes and No How much difference?
 Between good and evil How much difference??
What others fear I must fear - How pointless!
People are wreathed in smiles As if at a carnival banquet. I alone am
 passive, giving no sign, Like an infant who has not yet smiles. Forlorn as
 if I had no home.
Others have enough and more, I alone am left out. I have the mind of a
 fool, Confused, confused.
Others are bright and intelligent, I alone and dull, dull, Drifting on the
 ocean, Blown about endlessly.
Others have plans, I alone am wayward and stubborn, I alone am different
 from others, Like a baby in the womb.
