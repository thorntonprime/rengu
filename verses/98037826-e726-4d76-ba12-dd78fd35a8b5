Title: When My Rear End Becomes As Cute As Mars
---
Sometimes I am like a big firefly, suspended in midair because of
ecstasy.

When my rear end becomes as cute as Mars -- uncontrollably blinking,
winking, wishing goodwill to the earth from the sky --

it is hard to stay incognito (as is my preference) and not have
someone point toward me and say,

"Hey, look at Hafiz."

What to do? I guess illumination is hard to hide!
