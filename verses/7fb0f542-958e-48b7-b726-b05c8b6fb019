To arrive at a true understanding by realizing one’s true self is called
(the way of) nature. To realize one’s true self from understanding (of
the universe) is called (the way of) culture. Who has realized his true self
gains thereby understanding. Who has gained a (complete) understanding finds
thereby his true self.
