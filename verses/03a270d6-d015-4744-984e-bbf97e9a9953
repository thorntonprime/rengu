For you the world outside will now stand transformed as the very expression or
manifestation of God -- everywhere the Light of God will dazzle your eyes; even
in the apparent diversity and activity of nature you will strangely be
conscious of an allpervading stillness and peace of the Eternal -- a
consciousness which is unshakably permanent. You will also feel that you are
liberated from the harassing dualities of life followed by the crowning
experience of an abiding state of ineffable ecstasy.
