Title: Constrained In Will
---
So it is said, If the body is made to labor and take no rest, it will
wear out; if the spiritual essence is taxed without cessation, it will
grow weary, and weariness will bring exhaustion. It is the nature of
water that if it is not mixed with other things, it will be clear, and
if nothing stirs it, it will be level. But if it is dammed and hemmed
in and not allowed to flow, then, too, it will cease to be clear. As
such, it is a symbol of Heavenly Virtue. So it is said, To be pure,
clean, and mixed with nothing; still, unified, and unchanging; limpid
and inactive; moving with the workings of Heaven - this is the way to
care for the spirit.
