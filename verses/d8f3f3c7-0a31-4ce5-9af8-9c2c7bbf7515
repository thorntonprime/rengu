Esteem no one especially worthy,
and men are freed from rivalry.
Prize no rarity,
and men are freed from thievery.
Place no treasure where all may see,
and men are freed from envy.

Who governs well
clears minds and fills stomachs,
diffuses ambitions and consolidates bones.
Where hearts and minds are free from want,
no cunning foe can muster discord.

Where no one needs to intervene,
order reigns freely.
