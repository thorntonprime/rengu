The Great Man in his teaching is like the shadow that follows a form,
the echo that follows a sound. Only when questioned does he answer, and
then he pours out all his thoughts, making himself the companion of the
world. He dwells in the echoless, moves in the directionless, takes by
the hand you who are rushing and bustling back and forth, and
proceeds to wander in the beginningless. He passes in and out of the
boundless, and is ageless as the sun. His face and form blend with
the Great Unity, the Great Unity which is selfless. Being selfless, how
then can he look upon possession as possession? He who fixed his eyes
on possession - he was the "gentleman" of ancient times. He who fixes
his eyes on nothingness - he is the true friend of Heaven and earth.
