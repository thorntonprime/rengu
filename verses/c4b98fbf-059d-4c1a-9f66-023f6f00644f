Some there be, that although they be not deceived with this error as it is
set here, yet for pride and curiosity of natural wit and letterly cunning
leave the common doctrine and the counsel of Holy Church. And these with all
their favourers lean over much to their own knowing： and for they were never
grounded in meek blind feeling and virtuous living, therefore they merit to
have a false feeling, feigned and wrought by the ghostly enemy. Insomuch,
that at the last they burst up and blaspheme all the saints, sacraments,
statutes, and ordinances of Holy Church. Fleshly living men of the world,
the which think the statutes of Holy Church over hard to be amended by, they
lean to these heretics full soon and full lightly, and stalwartly maintain
them, and all because them think that they lead them a softer way than is
ordained of Holy Church.

Now truly I trow, that who that will not go the strait way to heaven, that
they shall go the soft way to hell. Each man prove by himself, for I trow that
all such heretics, and all their favourers, an they might clearly be seen
as they shall on the last day, should be seen full soon cumbered in great
and horrible sins of the world in their foul flesh, privily, without their
open presumption in maintaining of error： so that they be full properly
called Antichrist’s disciples. For it is said of them, that for all their
false fairness openly, yet they should be full foul lechers privily.
