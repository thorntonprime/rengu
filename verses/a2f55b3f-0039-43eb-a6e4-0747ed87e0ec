Joshu began the study of Zen when he was sixty years old and
continued until he was eighty, when he realized Zen.

He taught from the age of eighty until he was one hundred and
twenty.

A student once asked him： "If I haven't anything in my mind,
what shall I do?"

Joshu replied： "Throw it out."

"But if I haven't anything, how can I throw it out?" continued
the questioner.

"Well," said Joshu, "then carry it out."
