The nobler the thing the bigger it is and the more universal. Love is as noble
as it is universal. It does indeed seem hard, as our Lord commands, to love our
even-christians as ourselves. The unenlightened say that we ought to love them
just the same as they love themselves. Not so. We ought to love them no more
than our own selves, which is not difficult.
