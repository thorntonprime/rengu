It must be said that everything, that in any way is, is from God. For whatever
is found in anything by participation must be caused in it by that to which it
belongs essentially. ... God is self-subsisting being itself, (which) being can
be only one. ... Therefore all beings other than God are not their own being,
but are beings by participation. Therefore, it must be that all things which
are diversified by the diverse participation of being, so as to be more or less
perfect, are caused by one First Being, Who possesses being most perfectly.

Hence Plato said that unity must come before multitude; and Aristotle said that
whatever is greatest in being and greatest in truth is the cause of every being
and of every truth, just as whatever is the greatest in heat is the cause of
all heat.
