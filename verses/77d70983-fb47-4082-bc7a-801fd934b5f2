Let us endeavour to get our minds enlightened with divine truth, clear and
practical truth, let us earnestly endeavour after a true participation of the
divine nature; and then shall we find hell and death to flee away before us.
Let us not impute the fruits of our own sluggishness to the power of the evil
spirit without, or to Godâ€™s neglecting of us; say not,  Who shall stand
against those mighty giants? ... Open thy windows, thou sluggard, and let in
the beams of divine light, that are there waiting upon thee till thou awake
out of thy slothfulness; then shalt thou find the shadows of the night
dispelled and scattered, and the warm beams of light and love infolding
thee. ...  We need not go and beat the air to drive away those evil spirits
from about us. as Herodotus reports the Caunians once to have beaten out the
strange gods from amongst them; but let us turn within ourselves, and beat
down that pride and passion, those holds of Satan there, which are therefore
strong, because we oppose them weakly. Sin is nothing else but a degeneration
from true goodness, conceived by a dark and cloudy understanding, and brought
forth by a corrupt will; it hath no consistency in itself, or foundation of
its own to support it. ... Let us withdraw our will and affections from it.
and it will soon fall into nothing.
