The soul which has been in the presence of Christ experiences sweetness, and
from this sweetness is bom a chaste joy which is the embrace of divine love
clasping the depths of the soul. Now all the pleasures of the earth fused into
a single pleasure and poured in their entirety into a single man are nothing
compared with the joy of which I speak; for here it is God who flows into our
depths in all His purity, and our souls are not only filled but overflowing.
Only the light of this experience can show the soul the dreadful misery of
those who live without love.
