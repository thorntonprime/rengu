\"As far as we personally are concerned, happiness is done with whatever the
course of events may be. I know that it is the duty of one king to suffer
on behalf of the others, and we are fulfilling that duty well. I hope that
someday the fact may be recognized by them all." Too late, Marie Antoinette
had grasped in the very depths of her soul that she was destined to become a
historical figure, and this need for transcending the limitations of her own
time intensified her forces to an extreme. For when a human being begins to
plumb his own depths, when he has determined to dig into the inmost recesses
of his own personality, he discovers in his own blood the shadowy powers
of his ancestors. The fact that she had sprung from the House of Habsburg,
that she was descendant and heiress of an ancient imperial line, that she
was the daughter of Maria Theresa, lifted this weak and unsteady woman
as if by magic above her previous limitations. She felt it incumbent upon
her to be “digne de Marie Therese,” to be worthy of her mother,
and “courage” became the leitmotiv to her progress toward imminent
destruction. Again and again we find such declarations as that “nothing
can break my courage”; and when news came from Vienna that her brother
Joseph, on an agonizing deathbed, had maintained his composure to the last
hour, she felt prophetically that she, too, was foredoomed to die bravely,
and she replied with the most self-confident saying of her life： “I
venture to declare he died in a way worthy of myself.”
