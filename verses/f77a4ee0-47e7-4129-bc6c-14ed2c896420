  - Discernment-Truth=The Void=The Plenitude of the Void
  - Discernment-Truth=Knowledge=The Knower and the Known
By: Sri Ramana Maharshi

Absence of thoughts does not mean a blank. There must be one to know the blank.
Knowledge and ignorance are of the mind. They are born of duality. But the Self
is beyond knowledge and ignorance. It is light itself. There is no necessity to
see the Self with another Self.
