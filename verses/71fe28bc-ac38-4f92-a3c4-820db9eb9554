The hundred-year-old tree is hacked up to make bowls for the
sacrificial wine, blue and yellow, with patterns on them, and the chips
are thrown into the ditch. Compare the sacrificial bowls with the chips
in the ditch and you will find them far apart in beauty and ugliness;
yet they are alike in having lost their inborn nature. Robber Chih,
Tseng, and Shih are far apart in deeds and righteousness, and yet they
are the same in having lost their inborn nature. There are five
conditions under which the inborn nature is lost. One when the five
colors confuse the eye and cause the eyesight to be unclear. Two when
the five notes confuse the ear and cause the hearing to be unclear.
Three when the five odors stimulate the nose and produce weariness and
congestion in the forehead. Four when the five flavors dull the mouth,
causing the sense of taste to be impaired and lifeless. Five when
likes and dislikes unsettle the mind and cause the inborn nature to
become volatile and flighty. These five are all a danger to life. And
yet the followers of Yang Tzu and Mo Tzu go striding around, thinking
they have really gotten hold of something. This is not what I call
getting hold of something.
