Taking as a bow the great weapon of the Upanishad,
One should put upon it an arrow sharpened by meditation.
Stretching it with a thought directed to the essence of That,
Penetrate that Imperishable as the mark, my friend.
The mystic syllable Om (pranava) is the bow. The arrow is the Self (Atman).
Brahma is said to be the mark (laksya).
By the undistracted man is It to be penetrated.
One should come to be in It, as the arrow (in the mark).
