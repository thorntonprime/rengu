Title: So Romantically
Description: September 24
---
I thought I was on the right track when I was admiring an odd shaped squash
 cooking in a pot and I called it Angel.
At least that meant something to me. It seemed like progress ...
spontaneously talking in a sweet and sincere manner to something
that I had not ever spoken to so romantically, before.
