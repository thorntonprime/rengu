St Augustine says, at first the scriptures will amuse and attract the
child, and in the end, when he tries to understand them, they make
fools of the wise, for none is so simple-minded but can find his level
there nor none so wise but when he tries to fathom them will find they
are beyond his depth and discover more therein. All the stories and
quotations taken from them have another, esoteric, meaning. Our
understanding of them is as totally unlike the thing as it is in
itself and as it is in God, as though it did not exist.
