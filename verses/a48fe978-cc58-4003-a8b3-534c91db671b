What time the mind is fixed on God and there abides, the senses are obedient to
the mind. As one should hang a needle to a magnet and then another needle on to
that, until there are four needles, say, depending from the magnet. As long as
the first needle stays clinging to the magnet all the other needles will keep
clinging on to that but when the leader drops the rest will go as well. So,
while the mind keeps fixed on God the senses are subservient to it but if
the mind should wander off from God the passions will escape and be unruly.
