Deep snow. A marvelous morning (early in the night hours) in which, among
other thing, I suddenly wrote a French poem.

Curious dimension of time： in four hours (besides writing this, poem, getting
breakfast and cleaning up) I reread a few pages of Burtt‘s book and perhaps
twenty pages of Kitaro Nishida. That was all. But the time was most fruitful
in depth and awareness, and I did not know what happened to all these hours.

Later I could see by the deer tracks that sometime in the dark before dawn a
couple of deer had jumped the fence right out in the front of the hermitage --
but I did not notice them. (Too dark, and with my desk light in front of
me I do not see out when it is dark.)

As regards prayer -- in the hermitage. To be snowed in is to be reminded that
this is a place apart, from which praise goes up to God, and that my honor
and responsibility are that praise. This is my joy, my only “importance.”
For it is important! To be chosen for this! And then the realization that
the Spirit is given to me, the veil is removed from my heart, that I reflect
“with open face” the glory of Christ (II Corinthians 3：12-18). It would
be easy to remain with one's heart veiled, and it is not by any wisdom of
my own, but by God’s gift, that it is unveiled.
