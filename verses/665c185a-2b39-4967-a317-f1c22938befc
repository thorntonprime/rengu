  Title: For Lovers of God Everywhere
Title: I Cannot Dance, O Lord
---
I cannot dance, O Lord,
Unless You lead me.
If you wish me to leap joyfully,
Let me see You dance and sing --

Then I will leap into Love --
And from Love into Knowledge,
And from Knowledge into the Harvest,
That sweetest Fruit beyond human sense.

There I will stay with you, whirling.
