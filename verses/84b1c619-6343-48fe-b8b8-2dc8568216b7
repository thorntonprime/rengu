At the beginning of spiritual life the devotee should observe such rites as
pilgrimage, putting a string of beads around his neck, and so forth. But
outward ceremonies gradually drop off as he attains the goal, the vision
of God. Then his only activity is the repetition of Godâ€™s name, and
contemplation and meditation on Him.
