Thus evil hath no being, nor any inherence in things that have being.
Evil is nowhere qua evilï¼š and it arises not through any power but
through weakness. Even the devils derive their existence from the
Good, and their mere existence is good. Their evil is the result of a
fall from their proper virtues, and is a change with regard to their
individual state, a weakness of their true angelical perfections. And
they desire the Good in so far as they desire existence, life, and
understanding; and in so far as they do not desire the Good, they
desire that which hath no being. And this is not desire, but an error
of real desire.
