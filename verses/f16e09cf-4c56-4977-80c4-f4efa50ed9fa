If men can’t evade the demands of their father and emperor, what can they
do when Death gives them an order? They protest bitterly and scream at
heaven, but they’ve got to obey. The man who howls the loudest is the one
who thinks he’s just reached the pinnacle of worldly success.

The enlightened understand life and death. They always live well and never
complain.
