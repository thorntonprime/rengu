Title: Heaven And Earth
---
He who knows he is a fool is not the biggest fool; he who knows he is
confused is not in the worst confusion. The man in the worst confusion
will end his life without ever getting straightened out; the biggest
fool will end his life without ever seeing the light. If three men are
traveling along and one is confused, they will still get where they are
going - because confusion is in the minority. But if two of them are
confused, then they can walk until they are exhausted and never get
anywhere - because confusion is in the majority. And with all the
confusion in the world these days, no matter how often I point the way,
it does no good. Sad, is it not?
