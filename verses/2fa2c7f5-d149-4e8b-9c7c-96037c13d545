Title: Keeping the Contract
Commentary: |
  This chapter is equally relevant to private relationships and to political
  treaties. Its realistic morality is based on a mystical perception of the
  fullness of the Way.
---
After a great enmity is settled
some enmity always remains.
How to make peace?
Wise souls keep their part of the contract
and donâ€™t make demands on others.
People whose power is real fulfill their obligations;
people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.

The Way of heaven plays no favorites.
It stays with the good.
