\‘The Order in itself can neither be spoiled nor corrupted by the fault
of the subordinates or the superiors. One wishing to enter an Order should
not consider the bad people that are within; he should support himself on
the arm of the Order which is strong and cannot weaken, and remain faithful
to it until death.’
