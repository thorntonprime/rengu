So it is said, With the sage, his life is the working of Heaven, his
death the transformation of things. In stillness, he and the yin share
a single Virtue; in motion, he and the yang share a single flow. He is
not the bearer of good fortune, nor the initiator of bad fortune.
Roused by something outside himself, only then does he respond;
pressed, only then does he move; finding he has no choice, only then
does he rise up. He discards knowledge and purpose and follows along
with the reasonableness of Heaven. Therefore he incurs no disaster from
Heaven, no entanglement from things, no opposition from man, no blame
from the spirits. His life is a floating, his death a rest. He does not
ponder or scheme, does not plot for the future. A man of light, he does
not shine; of good faith, he keeps no promises. He sleeps without
dreaming, wakes without worry. His spirit is pure and clean, his soul
never wearied. In emptiness, nonbeing, and limpidity, he joins with the
Virtue of Heaven.
