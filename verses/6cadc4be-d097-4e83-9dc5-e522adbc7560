Whatever sacrifice may be made in the service of the Lord, know that it is
the equanimity of your soul that is the best and fittest offering. Equanimity
is sweet to taste and has the supernatural power of transforming everything
to ambrosia.

Equanimity expands the soul and gladdens the mind, as the sunlight fills the
vault of heaven, and it is considered to be the highest devotion.
