Soul gave me this box of emptiness.
What I say is one truth I know.

I go to neither side of any argument.
I stay in the center, letting explanations rise from failure,
this weeping witness face, this saffron tulip,
a vague trace.

Whoever understands me like Saladin does,
this is for you, this opening.
