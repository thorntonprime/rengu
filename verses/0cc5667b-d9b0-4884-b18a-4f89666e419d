Listen to the teaching of the Shâstra in which Vaishnavas believe： Just as
Nârâyan and Krishna are one essence, so are Lakshmi and the Gopis identical and
not diverse. Lakshmi in the garb of the Gopis tasted Krishna’s company. In
theology it is a sin to recognise a plurality of gods. The devotee meditates on
one and the same God; he gives different images to the same deity.
