\"No indeed!" said Jo of the North Sea. "There is no end to the weighing
of things, no stop to time, no constancy to the division of lots, no
fixed rule to beginning and end. Therefore great wisdom observes both
far and near, and for that reason recognizes small without considering
it paltry, recognizes large without considering it unwieldy, for it
knows that there is no end to the weighing of things. It has a clear
understanding of past and present, and for that reason it spends a long
time without finding it tedious, a short time without fretting at its
shortness, for it knows that time has no stop. It perceives the nature
of fullness and emptiness, and for that reason it does not delight if
it acquires something nor worry if it loses it, for it knows that there
is no constancy to the division of lots. It comprehends the Level Road,
and for that reason it does not rejoice in life nor look on death as a
calamity, for it knows that no fixed rule can be assigned to beginning
and end.
