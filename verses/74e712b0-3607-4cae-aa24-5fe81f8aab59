Our great ancestors, that is, the Companions and the Successors and the
generation which followed them, ever held this path (of sanctification) to be
the path of truth and right guidance. It is based on unfailing perseverance in
worship, utter devotion to All-Highest God, turning away from the adornments of
this world, renunciation of what most men seek after in the way of pleasure
and dignity, and isolating oneself from all mankind in spiritual retreat
(khalwah) for the sake of worship. Now these were the general practices of the
Companions and the Moslems of old (as-salaj). Then in the second generation
and afterwards, when worldliness spread and men tended to become more and
more bound up with the ties of this life, those who dedicated themselves to
the worship of God were distinguished from the rest by the title as-SÃ»fiyyah
(Sufis) and al-Mutasawwifah (those who aspire to be Sufis).
