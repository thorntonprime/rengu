One filled with integrity—
how like a hardy newborn!
No venomed bug will sting him.
No bird or beast will seize him.
His bones are soft, his muscles weak,
and yet how tight his grasp!
He knows not union, male and female,
and yet how much aroused!
Vitality is at its peak.
He cries full vent the whole day through,
and yet is never hoarse.
His harmony is at its peak.

Harmony means constancy.
Constancy means insight.

Living fully bodes well.
Thus, regulate the vital breath.

To live robustly, then decline：
such is not the Way.
What follows not the Way, soon ends.
