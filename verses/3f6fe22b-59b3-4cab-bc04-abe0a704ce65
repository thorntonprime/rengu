God is nearer to me than I am to my own self; my life depends upon Godâ€™s
being near me, present in me. So is he also in a stone, a log of wood, only
they do not know it. If the wood knew of God and realized his nearness like
the highest angel does, then the log would Holiness be as blessed as the
chief of all the angels.
