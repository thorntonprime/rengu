Let Homer sing his verse. I listen to this sublime genius in comparison with
whom I, a simple herdsman, a humble farmer, am as nothing. What, indeed, --
if product is to be compared with product, -- are my cheeses and my beans in
the presence of his “Iliad”? But, if Homer wishes to take from me all
that I possess, and make me his slave in return for his inimitable poem,
I will give up the pleasure of his lays and dismiss him. I can do without
his “Iliad,” and wait, if necessary, for the "Aeneid." Homer cannot live
twenty-four hours without my products. Let him accept, then, the little that
I have to offer; and then his muse may instruct, encourage and console me.
