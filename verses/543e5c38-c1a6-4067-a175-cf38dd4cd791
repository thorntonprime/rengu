As our Matter, in the philosophical work, after being dissolved into its three
parts or principles, must again be coagulated and reduced into its own proper
salt, and into one essence, which is then called the salt of the Sages; so God,
and His Son, must be known as One, by means of their essential substance, and
must not be regarded as two or three Divinities, possessing more than one
essence. When you have thus known God through His Son, and united them by the
bond of the Holy Spirit, God is no longer invisible, or full of wrath, but you
may feel His love, and, as it were, see Him with your eyes, and handle Him with
your hands, in the person of Jesus Christ, His Son and express image.
