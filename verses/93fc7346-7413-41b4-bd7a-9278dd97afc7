Title: The One
---
There is within me a citadel where I am one with You,
a place so strong and pure that no one -- not even You --

dares to look inside, unless You strip Yourself of all
Your names and natures, to the point where You

are one and simple, for only there, beyond all
doing and thinking and feeling, can You know

the one I am and can I know the one You are.
