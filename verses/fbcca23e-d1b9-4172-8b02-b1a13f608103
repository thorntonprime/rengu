Nangt창 used to instruct me about the nature of Satchid창nanda Brahman. He would
say that It is like an infinite ocean -- water everywhere, to the right, left,
above, and below.  Water enveloped in water. It is the Water of the Great
Cause, motionless. Waves spring up when It becomes active. Its activities are
creation, preservation, and destruction. ...

Brahman is beyond mind and speech. A salt doll entered the ocean to measure its
depth; but it did not return to tell others how deep the ocean was. It melted
in the ocean itself.
