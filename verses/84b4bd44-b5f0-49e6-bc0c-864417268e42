That archetypal world is the true Golden Age, age of Kronos, whose very
name suggests (in Greek) Exuberance (xopos) and Intellect ( vov√ß). For
here is contained all that is immortal; nothing here but is Divine Mind;
all is God; this is the place of every soul. Here is rest unbroken; for how
can that seek change, in which all is well; what need that reach to, which
holds all within itself; what increase can that desire, which stands utterly
achieved? All its content, thus, is perfect, that itself may be perfect
throughout, as holding nothing that is less than the divine, nothing that
is less than intellective. Its knowing is not by search but by possession,
its blessedness inherent, not acquired; for all belongs to it eternally and it
holds the authentic Eternity imitated by Time which, circling round the Soul,
makes towards the new thing and passes by the old. Soul deals with thing
after thing -- now Socrates; now a horse; always some one entity from among
beings -- but the Intellectual-Principle is all and therefore its entire
content is simultaneously present in that identity; this is pure being in
eternal actuality; nowhere is there any future, for every then is a now; nor is
there any past, for nothing there has ever ceased to be; everything has taken
its stand for ever, an identity well pleased, we might say, to be as it is.
