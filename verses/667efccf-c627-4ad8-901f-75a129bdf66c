Lord, how often shall I resign myself, and wherein shall I forsake myself?

Always and at every hour; as well in small things as in great. I except
nothing, but do desire that thou be found stripped of all things.

Otherwise, how canst thou be mine, and I thine, unless thou be stripped of
all self-will, both within and without?

The sooner thou doest this, the better it will be with thee; and the more
fully and sincerely thou doest it, so much the more shalt thou please me. and
so much the greater shall be thy gain.

Some there are who resign themselves, but with exceptionsï¼š for they put not
their whole trust in God, therefore they study how to provide for themselves.

Some also at first do offer all. but afterwards, being assailed with
temptation, they return again to their own ways, and therefore make no
progress in the ways of virtue.

These shall not attain to the true liberty of a pure heart, nor to the favor
of my sweetest friendship, unless they first make an entire resignation and a
daily oblation of themselves.

Without this, there neither is nor can be a fruitful union.
