The meaning we find in life cannot be separated from the meaning we give
death. Seen from the outside, death is an end -- from the inside, a beginning.
Properly died, death is a total release： letting ourselves go, letting
ourselves sink, letting ourselves fade into nothingness and fuse with the
fullness of eternity.
