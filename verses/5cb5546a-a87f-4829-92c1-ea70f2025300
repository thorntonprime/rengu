Title: Charged with the Transfiguration of All Things
Description: June 26

How all things are in migration! How they seek refuge in us. How each of them
desires to be relieved of externality and to live again in the Beyond which we
enclose and deepen within ourselves. We are convents of lived things, dreamed
things, impossible things; all that is in awe of this century saves itself
within us and there, on its knees, pays its debt to eternity.

Little cemeteries that we are, adorned with the flowers of our futile gestures,
containing so many corpses that demand that we testify to their souls. All
prickly with crosses, all covered with inscriptions, all spaded up and shaken
by countless daily burials, we are charged with the transmutation, the
resurrection, the transfiguration of all things. For how can we save what is
visible if not by using the language of absence, of the invisible?

And how to speak this language that remains mute unless we sing it with abandon
and without any insistence on being understood.
