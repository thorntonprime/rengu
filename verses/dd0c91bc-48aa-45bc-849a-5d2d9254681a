For we are the stars. For we sing.
For we sing with our light.
For we are birds made of fire.
For we spread our winds over the sky.
Our light is a voice.
We cut a road for the soul
for its journey through death.
For three of our number are hunters.
For these three hunt a bear.
For there never yet was a time
when these three didn't hunt.
For we face the hills with disdain.
This is the song of the stars.
