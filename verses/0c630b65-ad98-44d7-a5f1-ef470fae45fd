Do not be troubled about whether your heart is good or bad, or your sin light
or grievous. Only determine in your heart that you will be born into the Pure
Land, and so repeat the ‘Namu Amida Butsu’ with your lips, and let the
conviction accompany the sound of your voice, that you will of a certainty
be born into the Pure Land.  Then, according to your determined faith,
that karma will certainly be produced which will result in your birth into
that land. ... It all depends upon your own mental act, which makes everything
easy. If in your mind you waver, you will end in wavering. But if you make
up your mind to it, that settles your destiny to be born into the Pure Land.
