The Way holds sanctuary for all creatures,
a treasure for the true, a refuge for the erring.

Deft words earn favor,
fine works reward.
Let inept works and inapt words earn no less.

When leaders are installed or ministers appointed,
in pomp are reins of power bestowed.
Wiser to withdraw and without ceremony
bestow the Way upon the land.

The ancients saidï¼š
"Seek and you shall find."
"Err and be free from fault."
Thus all may value the Way.
