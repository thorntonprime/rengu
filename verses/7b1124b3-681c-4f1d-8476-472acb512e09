By: Hermes
Commentary: This does not mean that a saint is necessarily a philosopher, but
  it does mean that the intellectual heritage of a traditional collectivity
  profoundly influences the spiritual formation of its members. Cf. Orthodoxy
  and Revelation.

Without philosophy, it is impossible to be pious; but he who has learnt what
things are, and how they are ordered, and by whom, and to what end, will give
thanks for all things to the Maker. ...

And he who pursues philosophy to its highest reach will learn where Reality is,
and what it is; and having learnt this, he will be yet more pious.
