Title: Big and Sweet
---
There is a love that fills the universe so completely and
richly that it is impossible to separate from itself. It is
a holiness, a blessed everlastingness, that is indivisible
and so sweet. You will never see or comprehend it, or
pin it down, but it gives of itself without thinking, like
the warm light of the sun in the morning.
