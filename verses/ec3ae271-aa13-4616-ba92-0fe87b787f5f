Title: I Choose to Begin
---
I love all beginnings, despite their anxiousness and their uncertainty,
which belong to every commencement. If I have earned a pleasure or a reward,
or if I wish that something had not happened; if I doubt the worth of an
experience and remain in my past -- then I choose to begin at this very second.

Begin what? I begin. I have already thus begun a thousand lives.
