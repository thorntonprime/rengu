When the best students hear of the Way
They try zealously to put it into practice.
When average students hear of the Way
It’s sometimes here and sometimes gone.
When the worst students hear of the Way
They burst out laughing.
Not laughing would make it
Unworthy to be called the Way.
So the ancient text says：
The way that is bright seems dull.
The way forward seems to lead back.
The smooth way seems rough.
The highest virtue seems a valley.
The purest whiteness seems stained.
Excessive virtue seems defective.
Solid virtue seems inactive.
Simplicity appears sullied.
The great square has no corners.
The great vessel takes long to fashion.
The great note is soundless.
The great image has no form.
The Way hides in namelessness.
It is good at giving and perfecting.
