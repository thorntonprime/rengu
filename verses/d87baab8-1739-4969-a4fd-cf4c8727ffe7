Title: As I Was Thinking of You
---
As I was thinking of you three squirrels came by and all rubbed their tails
  against me,

which reaffirmed my general notion of things, beingï¼š that everyone is really
  on the right track

even if a wheel now and then gets stuck, or even runs over someone else.
