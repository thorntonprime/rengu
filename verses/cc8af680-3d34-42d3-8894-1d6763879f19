Title: Fit For Emperors And Kings

The madman Chieh Yu said, "This is bogus virtue! To try to govern the
world like this is like trying to walk the ocean, to drill through a
river, or to make a mosquito shoulder a mountain! When the sage
governs, does he govern what is on the outside? He makes sure of
himself first, and then he acts. He makes absolutely certain that
things can do what they are supposed to do, that is all. The bird flies
high in the sky where it can escape the danger of stringed arrows. The
field mouse burrows deep down under the sacred hill where it won't have
to worry about men digging and smoking it out. Have you got less sense
than these two little creatures?"
