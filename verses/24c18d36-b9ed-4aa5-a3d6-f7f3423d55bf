I say： had Mary not borne God in ghostly fashion first, he never had been born
of her in flesh. The woman said to Christ. ‘Blessed is the womb which bare
thee.' To which Christ replied. ‘Blessed not alone the womb which bare me;
blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.’ It is more worth to
God his being brought forth ghostly in the individual virgin or good soul than
that he was born of Mary bodily.
