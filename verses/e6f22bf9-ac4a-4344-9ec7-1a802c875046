Title: It Is a Holy Woman and a Temple
---
It is a holy man, a good poem, and a holy woman; and a temple and a mosque and
 a shrine.
Have you not been looking for a companion like that? For a place of such great
 refuge, where time asks nothing of you, where you can come and go as you
 please, where you basically control
all the rules because your heart knows best.
And don't have to give up any pleasures that might still be working, adding
 color to your cheeks.
There is nothing you touch that you hope won't fit into a puzzle you are
 seriously working on.
I know how the eye works, what its primary impetus and desire isï¼š to lay its
 gaze upon the beautiful, and for beauty to wink back.
The eye, like every part of you, is governed by your great and continual primal
 instinctive need to feel whole and able. Able to work and learn and give and
 play -- and love and love. Who would deny that?
It is a holy woman, a decent poem, and a holy man; and a temple and a mosque
 and a shrine.
Carry any relics from my words that you can.
