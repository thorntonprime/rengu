Title: Clinging to God
---
Yesterday in the morning, when I went out for a breath of air before my
novice conference, I saw men working on the hillside beyond the sheep
barn. At last the electric line is coming to my hermitagel All day they
were working on the holes, digging and blasting the rock with small charges,
young men in yellow helmets, good, eager, hardworking guys with machines. I
was glad of them and of American technology, pitching in to bring me light,
as they would for any farmer in the district. It was good to feel part of
this, which is not to be despised, but is admirable. (Which does not mean
that I hold any brief for the excess of useless devel- opments in technology.)

Galley proofs of the little Gandhi book for New Directions came and I
finished them in a couple of hours.A good letter from Morcelliana, and an
architect in Madrid who will use two essays on art from Disputed Questions,
etc., etc. Drawings from Lax.And a couple of the usual letters from crazy
people. It is good to be part of that too! Vanity. But that is the thing
about solitude. To realize how desperately we depend on the “existence”
that recognition by others gives us, and how hopeless we are without it
until God gives us feet to stand alone on. I have those feet sometimes, but
once again, let me realize that there is no absolute “standing alone” --
only awful poverty and insecurity and clinging to God in one’s need of
others, and greater appreciation of the smallest and most insignificant of
communal verities.
