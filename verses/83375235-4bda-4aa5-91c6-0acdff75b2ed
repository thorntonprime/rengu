Title: History and the Passion of Christ
---
The bombing goes on in Vietnam, The whole thinking of this country is awry
on war： basic conviction that force is the only thing that is effective,
That doubtless it is in many ways not “nice” but one must be realistic
and use it, with moral justification so as not to be just gangsters
as “they” are (the enemy), Thus, there is determination to settle
everything by force and to make sure one’s force is verbally justitied.

It is not altogether easy to make an act of faith that all of history is
in God’s hands, But history is in the hands of God, and the decisions
of men lead infallibly to the full expression of what is really hidden
in them and in their society, The actions of the US in Asia are Gods
judgment on the US, We have decided that we will police the world --
by the same tactics used by the police in Alabama： beating “colored
people” over the head because we believe they are “interior.” In
the end, an accounting will he demanded.

We have to see history as a book that is sealed and opened by the Passion
of Christ, But we still read it from the viewpoint of the Beast, Passion
of Christ = the passion ofthe poor, the underprivileged, etc, Viewpoint
of the Beast： self-righteousness and cruelty of power, Hubris of human
might and technological efficiency, But the same cruelty is bred by this
hubris in the weak, who grow strong by resisting it and overcoming it --
to be proud in their turn, Christ remains in agony until the end of time,
and in His agony Christ triumphs over all power.
