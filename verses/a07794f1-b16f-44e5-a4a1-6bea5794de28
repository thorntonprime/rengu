God spoke but one word, and in virtue of that in a moment were made the
sun, moon and that innumerable multitude of stars, with their differences
in brightness, motion and influence. He spoke and they were made. A single
word of Godâ€™s filled the air with birds, and the sea with fishes, made
spring from the earth all the plants and all the beasts we see. ...

This word then, whilst most simple and most single, produces all the
distinction of things; being invariable produces all fit changes, and, in
fine, being permanent in his eternity gives succession, vicissitude, order,
rank and season to all things.
