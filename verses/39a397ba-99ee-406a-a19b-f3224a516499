A monk once asked Master Zhaozhou, “Has a dog the Buddha nature or not?“

Zhaozhou said, "Mu!"

What is this mu? Mu is the first barrier for many koan students in some Zen
lineages, The heart of the question lies in the fact that the teachings say
that all beings sentient and insentient alike have the buddha nature. Why
would Zhaozhou say mu (no)?

At another time a monk asked, “Does a dog have buddha nature?"

Zhaozhou said, “Yes.”

The only way to, see into this mu is to let go of all discriminating thinking.
take the backward step, forget the self, and be mu with the whole body and
mind. Only then will the wisdom that has no teacher reveal itself.
