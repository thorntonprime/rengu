Prarabdha (past karma) being responsible for all happenings, how can
the obstacles to meditation be overcome?

Prarabdha concerns the mind only when extrovert, but not introvert.
The earnest seeker of the Self does not worry himself about any
obstacles. To think of obstacles is itself the greatest obstacle.
