The meditation â€˜I am Brahman' comprises sacrifice, gifts, penance, ritual,
prayer, Yoga, and worship. ... Since the Supreme Being abides as the Self,
constant surrender of the mind by absorption in the Self is said to comprise
all forms of worship. If only the mind comes under control, all else is
controlled.
