I give my heart without fear to the Belovedï¼š
As the polish goes into the gold, I have gone into him.
Through many lives, I heard only the outer music.
Now the teacher has whispered into my ears,
And familiar ties have gone the way of the weak thread.
I have met the Energy That Lifts Mountains --
That good luck now is my home.
