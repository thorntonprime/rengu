Title: Mother
---
The earth has been there for a long time. She is mother to all of us. She knows
everything. The Buddha asked the earth to be his witness by touching her with
his hand when he had some doubt and fear before his awakening. The earth
appeared to him as a beautiful mother. In her arms she carried flowers and
fruit, birds and butterflies, and many different animals, and offered them to
the Buddha. The Buddhaâ€™s doubts and fears instantly disappeared. Whenever you
feel unhappy, come to the earth and ask for her help. Touch her deeply, the way
the Buddha did. Suddenly, you too will see the earth with all her flowers and
fruit, trees and birds, animals and all the living beings that she has
produced. All these things she offers to you. You have more opportunities to be
happy than you ever thought. The earth shows her love to you and her patience.
The earth is very patient. She sees you suffer, she helps you, and she protects
you. When we die, she takes us back into her arms.
