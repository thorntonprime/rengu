Title: If I Did Not Know Your Name
---
I think it is time for a joke. You tell me one. I will take it easy here a
  minute and listen.

What is a mere few years, centuries, or millenniums between us? I should be
  able to follow ... any contemporary language.

I have entered such a state -- that I don't think will go away -- to where I
  have heard

every word anyone has ever spoken. Past, present, and future. Why not?

I am on a float trip in the Buddha's mind. Limits don't exist. All knowledge is
  there and not there, simultaneously,

surrounded by a brilliant splendor even I can still hardly believe is really
  true.

If I did not know your name, you whose face is close to what I have written,

I might doubt my own experience, for it is just so sublime.
