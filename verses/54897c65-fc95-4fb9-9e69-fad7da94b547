Lao Tzu said, "Your face is grim, your eyes are fierce, your forehead
is broad, your mouth gaping, your manner overbearing, like a horse held
back by a tether, watching for a chance to bolt, bounding off as though
shot from a crossbow. Scrutinizing ever so carefully, crafty in wisdom,
parading your arrogance - all this invites mistrust. Up in the
borderlands a man like you would be taken for a thief!"
