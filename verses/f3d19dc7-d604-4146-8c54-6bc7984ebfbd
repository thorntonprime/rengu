Had I had the chance of plunging this spiritual son of mine nine times
into utter despair, he would have been cleansed thoroughly of all his
sins. He would thus not have been required to be born again, but would
have disappeared totally, his physical body being forever dissolved;
he would have attained Nirvana. That it will not be so. and that he
will still retain a small portion of his demerits, is due to Damemaâ€™s
ill-timed pity and narrow understanding.
