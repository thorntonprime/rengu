The human soul has in it something that is divine; but there are joined to it
also the irrational parts, namely, desire and repugnance. These ... are
motive forces ... that have to do with mortal bodies. And so. as long as the
divine part of the soul is in the divine body, desire and repugnance are far
away from it： but when the divine part has entered into a mortal body, they
come into being as accretions on it. and it is through their presence that
the soul becomes bad. ... The soul of irrational animals consists of
repugnance and desire： and that is why these animals are called ‘irrational",
because they are deprived of the rational part of the soul.
