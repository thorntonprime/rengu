Lao Tan said, "A man like this is a drudging slave, a craftsman bound
to his calling, wearing out his body, grieving his mind. Because the
dog can catch rats, he ends up on a leash.' Because of his nimbleness,
the monkey is dragged down from the mountain forest. Ch'iu, I'm going
to tell you something - something you could never hear for yourself and
something you would never know how to speak of. People who have heads
and feet but no minds and no ears - there are mobs of them. To think
that beings with bodies can all go on existing along with that which is
bodiless and formless - it can never happen! A man's stops and starts,
his life and death, his rises and falls - none of these can he do
anything about. Yet he thinks that the mastery of them lies with man!
Forget things, forget Heaven, and be called a forgetter of self. The
man who has forgotten self may be said to have entered Heaven."
