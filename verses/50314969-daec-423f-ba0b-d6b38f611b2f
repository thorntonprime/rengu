Confucius said to Lao-tse. ‘To-day you are at leisure. Pray tell me about
perfect Tao.'

‘Purge your heart by fasting and discipline.' answered Lao-tse. ‘Wash your soul
as white as snow. Discard your knowledge. Tao is abstruse and difficult of
discussion. ...  Attainment implies non-discussion; discussion implies
non-attainment.'
