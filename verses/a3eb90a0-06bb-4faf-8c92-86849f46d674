Rich men's sons convened in a high hall,
with flowering lanterns brilliant as a reigning Lord,
when a man without even a candle
crept in for a piece of their light ...
Who'd ever think they'd chase him off,
home to his treasure-house there in his darkness.
Would one more man reduce their light?
Monstrous, to begrudge a ray!
