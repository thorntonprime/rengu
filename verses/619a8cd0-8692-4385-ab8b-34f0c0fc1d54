The miserable Passions are to be overcome by the vision of wisdom. The Passions
lie not in the objects of sense, nor in the sense-organs, nor between them, nor
elsewhere; where do they lie? And yet they disturb the whole world! They are
but a phantom. Then cast away thy heart's terror, and labour for wisdom.
