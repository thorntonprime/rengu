Upon thee that art the only God do I call, the more than great, the
unutterable, the incomprehensible; unto whom every power of principalities
is subjected; unto whom all authority boweth; before whom all pride falleth
down and keepeth silence; whom devils hearing of tremble; whom all creation
perceiving keepeth its bounds. Let thy name be glorified by us.
