By the cross of the malefactor on Christâ€™s left hand may be understood those
who have made a religious profession, and are hanging on the cross of
continual exercises and outward austerities which they have bound themselves
to practise; they have well deserved this cross, but it brings them no
profit, because they have not died on it to self-will and other sinful
failings. It is possible for them after this crucifixion to go down to
eternal torment with the unjust malefactor; so that, to use a common proverb,
they drag the barrow here and the wagon in the world to come.
