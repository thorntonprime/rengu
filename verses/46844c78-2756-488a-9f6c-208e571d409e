Title: Reading Tagore's Poem "Gardenisto"
---
My friend, you make me weep like flowers blooming on the grave
 of a lost lover.
You gladden me like love met unexpectedly in desert darkness
 without a single bird.
You’re the scent of blanched bones that break out of an ancient grave,
 floating Skyward.
You’re a song of hope within despair, sung while picking fallen flowers
 for a garland.

My friend, you weep over broken love.
Your tears can’t bring back scattered flowers to the bough.
Sprinkle your tears beneath flowering trees, not on fallen flowers.

You say the scent of death is sweet, but you can’t kiss the lips
 of dry bones.
Don’t spread a web of golden song over that grave,
 but plant a bloodstained banner.
The spring breeze tells how the poet’s song stirs the dead earth.

My friend, when I hear your song I’m unspeakably ashamed --
 because I hear it alone, far from my beloved.
