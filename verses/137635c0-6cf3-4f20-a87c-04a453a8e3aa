  - Invocation=The Glory of the Name
By: Robert Fludd
Commentary: \[Magic here is synonymous with] theurgy.
---
The unique and only subject of magic, as well as the true Kabbala, is none
other than Wisdom, the Word, the Christ. And there is no other name to invoke
than that of Jesus, for there is no name on earth, nor in heaven, by which we
can be saved, except for the name of Jesus, in which all things are reunited,
for the Christ Jesus is all in all.
