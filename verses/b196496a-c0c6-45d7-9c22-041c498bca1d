Books are comprehensible only to those who understand and things are valuable
only to those who can appreciate. Give a bow of decoration to a farmer, and he
will use it to chase birds away from his farm; give an emperorâ€™s robe to a
southern barbarian and he will wear it to carry wood. They are simply ignorant.
What else can be expected of them?
