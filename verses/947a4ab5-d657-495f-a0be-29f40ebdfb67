Title: The World More Bearable
---
Knowing how she can benefit us, beauty sometimes acts like a hooker.
Because she knows if we spend an hour with her we will be better off.
And beauty is right, she is clever. When has looking at the graciousness in
 nature or in art, or hearing some moving music
not softened your face, made your touch more wanted, your voice more rich
 and alive,
and the world more bearable. And the sweet taste of hope yours and able
 to impart.
