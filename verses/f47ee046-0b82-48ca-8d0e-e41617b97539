A baby, after an exhibition on the pot, with much anger and howling, stretches
out her arms with a little cry, as when her pram is passing under trees, to
reveal an immense wonder and love for life, -- a Soul. I have read that the
cuckoo enters the world with two advantages over other birds; a special muscle
on its back for throwing them from the nest; and a cry which is irresistible to
the foster-parents. This sudden cry of recognition and pleasure is what keeps
us all on the go from grab-all to crave. Volupt√©! The eternal cuckoo call.
