Look： you cannot see it,
for it is invisible.
Listen： you cannot hear it,
for it is inaudible,
Grasp： you cannot hold it,
for it is intangible.
Each as unfathomable as the next,
these three become as one.

It threads into the gateway of wonder
and returns again to nothingness.
The form of the formless, the image of the imageless,
elusive and beyond imagination.

From above, there is no light reflected.
From below, no shadow cast.
From before, there is nothing to meet,
From behind, no thing to follow.

Mindful of one's primal roots,
one floats along the Way.
