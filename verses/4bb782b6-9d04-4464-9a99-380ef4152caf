Withal, Father Prospero was a good-natured man and generous to the poor, of
whom he was perhaps the poorest. What he was paid for funerals, weddings,
and baptisms promptly passed to the hands of others. He was never absent
when people were ill or death visited a home, and he never lost his kindly
smile and comforting manner. He was unaffected in his good deeds, devoid of
pretension and solemnity, attaching no importance to his acts of kindness
and passing off allusions to them with pleasantries -- pleasantries that
on occasion could be a little broad.

When a village barkeep refused to accept the price of a “nip,”
Father Prospero would jokingly insist： “Don’t put on good manners,
man! Take your pennies! You need them to support that mistress of yours
and her kids." Or if some self-righteous village gossip came to him with
a story about so-and-so, he would say; “But woman, you’d be worse
than they are if you could find a fellow sinner” -- and the sting of
the reproof would not be lessened by its joking manner.
