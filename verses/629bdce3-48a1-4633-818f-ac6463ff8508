Especially well-versed is he (Mingliaotse) in the teaching of Taoism regarding
‘nourishing the spirit’. Sometimes, when he is watching dancing or
hearing singing which borders on the bawdy and people make ribald jokes to
find out his attitude toward these things, he seems to be enjoying himself,
like the romantic scholars. But when it comes to extinguishing the candle
and the host asks him to stay with some girl entertainer, and when the party
becomes really rowdy, he sits upright with an austere appearance, and nobody
can make anything of him.
