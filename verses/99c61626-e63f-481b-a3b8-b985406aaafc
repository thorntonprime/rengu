He who belongs to God and to whom God belongs is not connected with anything
in the universe. The real gist of gnosis is to recognize that to God is the
kingdom. When a man knows that all possessions are in the absolute control of
God, what further business has he with mankind, that he should be veiled from
God by them or by himself? All such veils are the result of ignorance. As
soon as ignorance is annihilated, they vanish, and this life is made equal
in rank to the life hereafter.
