Title: To the Reader
---
I would like to say to the diligent reader of my writings and to others
who are interested in them that I am not at all concerned with appearing
to be consistent. In my search after Truth I have discarded many ideas and
learnt many new things. Old as I am in age, I have no feeling that I have
ceased to grow inwardly or that my growth will stop at the dissolution of
the flesh. What I am concerned with is my readiness to obey the call of
Truth, my God, from moment to moment, and, therefore, when anybody finds any
inconsistency between any two writings of mine, if he has still faith in my
sanity, he would do well to choose the later of the two on the same subject.
