I believe in one God, sole and eternal, who moveth all the heaven, himself
 unmoved, with love and with desire.
And for such belief I have not only proofs physic and metaphysic, but it is
 given me likewise by the truth which hence doth proceed
through Moses, through the Prophets and through the Psalms, through the Gospel
 and through you who wrote when the glowing Spirit had made you fosterers.
