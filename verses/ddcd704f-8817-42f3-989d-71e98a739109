  Title: Dialogues with Silence
---
This nearness to You in the darkness
is too simple and too close for excitement.
It is commonplace for all things
to live an unexpected life in the nightï¼š
but their life is illusory and unreal.
The illusion of sound only intensifies
the infinite substance of your silence.

Here at Gethsemani,
in this place where I made my vows,
where I have had my hands anointed for the Holy Sacrifice,
where I have had Your priesthood seal
the depth and intimate summit of my being,
a word,
a thought,
would defile the quiet
of Your inexplicable love.
