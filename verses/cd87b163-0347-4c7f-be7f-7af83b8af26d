  - Life-Love=The Primordial State=The Sphere of the Moon
By: Black Elk
Commentary: >
  The moon is analogous symbolically with the center of the human state, and
  the full moon perfectly facing the sun represents the soul in plenitude of
  illumination. ‘The direct light of the sun. or more particularly the ray of
  light which connects the moon with the sun. is thus a symbol of the Intellect,
  whereas the rays which the moon sends out into the night represent the
  intellectual intuitions which act as mediators between the moon of the Heart
  and the darkness of the soul' (Abu Bakr Sirâj ed-Din： The Book of Certainly,
  London. Rider. 1952. p. 66).

The wiwanyag wachipi (dance looking at the sun) is one of our greatest rites
and was first held many, many winters after our people received the sacred pipe
from the White Buffalo Cow Woman. It is held each year during the Moon of
Fattening (June) or the Moon of Cherries Blackening (July), always at the time
when the moon is full, for the growing and dying of the moon reminds us of our
ignorance which comes and goes; but when the moon is full it is as if the
eternal light of the Great Spirit were upon the whole world.
