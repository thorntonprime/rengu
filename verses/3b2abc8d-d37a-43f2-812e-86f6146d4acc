Commentary: |
  \'The church and the graveyard are often in the same field. This
  alone is a direct acknowledgment that Christian teachings have not
  been even comprehended. The Christ-man has spoken and the listening
  ear has heard. "If a man believes in me. he shall never die"' -- a
  travesty on St John, XI.  26. [Baird T. Spalding. Life and Teaching of
  the Masters o f the Far East. vol. III. Foreword]
