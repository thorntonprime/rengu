Title: Fight Harmlessly
---
How gladly, my young friend, I would respond to your new leaflet; but here
the words come hard to me. On the whole I want to acknowledge that you
do well to approach this conflict as a matter intimately related to your
own disposition. This is surely the most responsible attitude. You must
only take care to eliminate from the tone you use all consternation and
reproachfulness. My friend, this is importantï¼š fight harmlessly.
