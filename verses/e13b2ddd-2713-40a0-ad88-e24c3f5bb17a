If ... while remaining normally amongst the ‘six dusts’ of the active life, a
man clothes himself with a sort of spiritual sheen, is simple, unalloyed,
complete and of one piece, that man will not err to any great degree. ... He is
one who boldly and successfully displays his courageous disposition and
advances without delay or hesitation. And by the very fact of so doing such a
man raises up the very source and origin of his own soul and mind, and brings
to a final end all those roots of existence which tie us to the cycle of life
and death. For such a man there is nothing but great joy, enough to dissolve
the sky and shatter the iron mountains. He is to be compared with the lotus
which blossoms and becomes ever more beautiful and more deliciously scented as
it gets nearer to the fire.

And if you ask. ‘How can this be?’ it is because the fire is itself the lotus
and the lotus is itself the fire.
