There is, disciples, a Realm devoid of earth and water, fire and air. It is not
endless space, nor infinite thought, nor nothingness, neither ideas nor
non-ideas. Not this world nor that is it. I call it neither a coming nor a
departing, nor a standing still, nor death, nor birth ; it is without a basis,
progress, or a stay; it is the ending of sorrow.

For that which clingeth to another thing there is a fall; but unto that which
clingeth not no fall can come. Where no fall cometh, there is rest, and where
rest is, there is no keen desire. Where keen desire is not, naught cometh or
goeth; and where naught cometh or goeth there is no death, no birth. Where
there is neither death nor birth, there neither is this world nor that, nor in
between -- it is the ending of sorrow.

There is, disciples, an Unbecome, Unborn, Unmade, Unformed; if there were not
this Unbecome, Unborn, Unmade, Unformed, there would be no way out for that
which is become, born, made, and formed; but since there is an Unbecome,
Unborn, Unmade, Unformed, there is escape for that which is become, born, made,
and formed.
