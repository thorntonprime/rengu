Ignorance conceals the pre-existent Knowledge just as water plants cover over
the surface of a pond. Clear away the plants and you have the water. You
don't have to create it; it is there already. Or take another example --
a cataract grows on the eye and prevents a man from seeing; remove the
cataract and he sees. Ignorance is the cataract. ... Jnana (Knowledge) is
not something to be attained, it is eternal and self-existent. On the other
hand, ignorance has a cause and an end. The root of it is the idea that the
devotee is a separate being from God. Remove this and what remains is Jnana.
