Title: Experiencing God
---
In the last analysis, I have a completely indescribable passion for
experiencing God, and this God is unquestionably closer to that of the
Old Testament than He is to the Messiah's Gospels. I must admit that
what I have most wanted in this life has been to discover within
myself a temple to earth, and to dwell therein.
