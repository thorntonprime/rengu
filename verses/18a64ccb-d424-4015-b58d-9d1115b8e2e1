I maintain that Democratic manners -- typified by the practice of calling
the boss by his first name -- have reached the point in our country where
they conduce not to the preservation of personal dignity but to the abject
submission of one man to another. These manners, gradually developed in
colonial and postrevolutionary days, worked well in a society largely of
self-sufficient farmers. But circumstances have changed, with the usual
ironical result.

What happens on the job at the present time? An employee greets the boss by
his first name, sits down in his presence, wears the same kind of clothes
the boss wears, avoids the use of sir, and ostensibly comports himself in
general as if he and the boss were as equal as two farmers. But of course
he and the boss are not equal, and this inequality must be signalized,
first, because the employee is anxious to please the boss, who can advance
or impede his fortunes; and secondly, because the boss is anxious that
his authority receive recognition, without which he cannot function with
any confidence.

In the absence of overt and conventional methods of expressing deference,
how then does the American employee acknowledge the boss’s superior
status? He does so by perfecting a subtle repertoire of body movements
and vocal expressions. This repertoire includes the boyish grin, the
deprecatory cough, the unfinished sentence, the appreciative giggle, the
drooping shoulders, the head-scratch, and the bottom-waggle. But there
are employees, the truly gifted ones -- as actors, they would adorn the
Stanislavski school -- who can dispense with these definable maneuvers
and simply live the part, their whole being radiating a kind of sweet
eloquence of submission.
