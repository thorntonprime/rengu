The divine mind (sensus divinus=intellect) is wholly of like nature with
eternity. It is motionless in itself, but though stable, is yet self-moving; it
is holy, and incorruptible, and everlasting, and has all attributes yet higher,
if higher there be, that can be assigned to the eternal life of the supreme
God, that life which stands fast in absolute reality. It is wholly filled with
all things imperceptible to sense, and with all-embracing knowledge; it is, so
to speak, consubstantial with God.
