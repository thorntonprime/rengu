Happening into realms peach-blossom pure,
I begin to feel the depths of a bamboo path,

and soon come to know a master's timeless
dwelling. It's far beyond things people seek.

Cranes dancing over steps all stone idleness,
gibbon in flight howling amid thick forests,

I slowly fathom dark-enigma's inner pattern,
and sitting at such depths, forget mind itself.
