Never have a companion who casts you in the shade, The more he does so,
the less desirable a companion he is, The more he excels in quality
the more in repute： he will always play first fiddle and you second,
If you get any consideration, it is only his leavings, The moon shines
bright alone among the stars： when the sun rises she becomes either
invisible or imperceptible, Never join one that eclipses you, but rather
one who sets you in brighter light, By this means the cunning Fabula in
Martial was able to appear beautiful and brilliant, owing to the ugliness
and disorder of her companions, But one should as little imperil oneself
by an evil companion as pay honour to another at the cost of one’s own
credit, When you are on the way to fortune associate with the eminent;
when am'ved, with the mediocre.
