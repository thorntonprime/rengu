Swaraj is a meaningless term, if we desire to keep a fifth of India under
perpetual subjection, and deliberately deny to then the fruits of national
culture. We are seeking the aid of God in this great purifying movement,
but we deny to the most deserving among His creatures the rights of
humanity. Inhuman ourselves, we may not plead before the throne for
deliverance from the inhumanity of others.
