Title: Say Who I Am
---
I am dust particles in sunlight.
I am the round sun.

To the bits of dust I say, Stay
To the sun, Keep moving.

I am morning mist,
and the breathing of evening.

I am wind in the top of a grove,
and surf on the cliff.

Mast, rudder, helmsman, and keel,
I am also the coral reef they founder on.

I am a tree with a trained parrot in its branches.
Silence, thought, and voice.

The musical air coming through a flute,
a spark off a stone, a flickering in metal.

Both candle,
and the moth crazy around it.

Rose, and the nightingale
lost in the fragrance.

I am all orders of being, the circling galaxy,
the evolutionary intelligence,

the lift and the falling away.
What is and what isn't.

You who know Jelaluddin,
you the one in all,

say who I am.
Say I am you.
