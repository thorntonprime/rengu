rain falls on everyone
the same old rain
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops

i send my echo out
to get your love with poem
obscures reflections of
my love

rain falls on everyone
the same old rain
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops

i'll save a prayer for you
so lost and longing too
bleach shared through dirty streaks
wrapped up in clean white sheets
and if you think they'll watch you now
you should know they won't

rain falls on everyone
the same old rain
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops

i send my echo out
to get your love with poem
obscure reflections of
of my secret power
force down the wings of god
to get your love with poem
obscure reflections of my love

and i'm just trying to talk to you
between the raindrops
rain falls on everyone
the same old rain
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops
rain falls on everyone
the same old rain
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops
and i'm just trying to walk with you
between the raindrops
