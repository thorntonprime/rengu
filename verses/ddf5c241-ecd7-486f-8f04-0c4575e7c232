How can reading a book keep you from dying?
How can reading a book keep you from being poor?
So why all this love of learning? To read,
as if loving to read made you better than others?
Just thisï¼š real humans, if they don't love learning,
where shall they find peace for this body?
Bitter herbs are the best medicine,
but they are hard to swallow ...
Try some garlic sauce. That'll help you get it down.
