God approaches our minds by receding from them.

We can never fully know Him if we think of Him as an object of capture,
to be fenced in by the enclosure ofour own ideas.

We know Him better after our minds have let Him go.

The Lord travels in all directions at once.

The Lord arrives from all directions at once.

Wherever we are, we find that He has just departed.

Wherever we go, we discover that He has just arrived before us.

Our rest can be neither in the beginning ofthis pursuit, nor in the pursuit
itself, nor in its apparent end. For the true end, which is Heaven, is an
end without end. It is a totally new dimension, in which we come to rest in
the secret that He must arrive at the moment of His departure; His arrival is
at every moment and His departure is not fixed in time.
