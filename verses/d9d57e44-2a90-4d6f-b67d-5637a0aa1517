\â€˜When these three powers of the soul -- memory, intelligence and will --
are reconciled and gathered together in My Name, then all the other works,
both outward and inward, which man performs, are sympathetically drawn
towards Me and united in Me through the sense of love, and man thus mounts
to the heights, following the crucified love.'
