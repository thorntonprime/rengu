In tireless prayer ... you shall be flooded to the depths of your soul
with a gracious sweetness of spirit and shall scent the inexpressible
goodness of God in an interior taste and most aromatic incense, which,
passing, He will minister to you; and with which you shall be
satisfied when His glory shall appear. You shall be satisfied, I
repeat, and with no disgust of satiety, for this immortal food is life
itself.
