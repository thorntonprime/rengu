In the external universe there is ceaseless turmoil, change, and unrest; at
the heart of all things there is undisturbed repose; in this deep silence
dwelleth the Eternal. Man partakes of this duality, and both the surface
change and disquietude, and the deep-seated eternal abode of Peace are
contained within him.
