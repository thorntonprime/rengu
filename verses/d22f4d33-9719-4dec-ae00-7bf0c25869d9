What is a merciful heart?

It is a heart on fire for the whole of creation,
for humanity,
for the birds,
for the animals,
for demons,
and for every created thing.

And at the recollection and sight of them,
the eyes of a merciful person
pour forth tears in abundance.

By the strong and vehement mercy
that grips such a personâ€™s heart,
and by such great compassion,
the heart is humbled
and one cannot bear to hear
or to see any injury
or slight sorrow
in any
in creation.
