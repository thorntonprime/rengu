When men hold on to their eyesight, the world will no longer be
dazzled. When men hold on to their hearing, the world will no longer be
wearied. When men hold on to their wisdom, the world will no longer be
confused. When men hold on to their Virtue, the world will no longer go
awry. Men like Tseng, Shih, Yang, Mo, Musician K'uang, Artisan Ch'ui,
or Li Chu all displayed their Virtue on the outside and thereby blinded
and misled the world. As methods go, this one is worthless!
