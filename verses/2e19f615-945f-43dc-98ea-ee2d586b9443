Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
He who has a clear understanding of the Virtue of Heaven and earth may
be called the Great Source, the Great Ancestor. He harmonizes with
Heaven; and by doing so he brings equitable accord to the world and
harmonizes with men as well. To harmonize with men is called human joy;
to harmonize with Heaven is called Heavenly joy. Chuang Tzu has said,
"This Teacher of mine, this Teacher of mine - he passes judgment on the
ten thousand things but he doesn't think himself severe; his bounty
extends to ten thousand generations but he doesn't think himself
benevolent. He is older than the highest antiquity but he doesn't think
himself long-lived; he covers heaven, bears up the earth, carves and
fashions countless forms, but he doesn't think himself skilled."  This
is what is called Heavenly joy.
