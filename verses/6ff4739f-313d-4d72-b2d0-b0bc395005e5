Title: Mary's Hiding
---
Before these possessions you love
slip away, say what Mary said
when she was surprised by Gabriel.

  I'll hide inside God.

Naked in her room
she saw a form of beauty
that could give her new life.

Like the sun coming up,
or a rose as it opens,
she leaped, as her habit was,
out of herself into the presence.

There was fire in the channel of her breath.
Light and majesty came.

I am smoke from that fire
and proof of its existence,
more than any external form.
