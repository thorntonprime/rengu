Now I would have you know that the Godly-minded man employs his soul-powers in
his outward man no more than his five senses really need it; and his interior
man only has recourse to the five senses so far as it is guide and keeper to
these five senses and can stop them being put to bestial uses as they so often
are by those who live according to the baser appetites, as do the mindless
beasts, and who deserve the name of beast rather than that of man. What
surplus energy she has beyond what she expends on her five senses the soul
bestows upon her inner man, and supposing he has toward some right high
endeavour she will call in all the powers she has loaned to the five senses
and then the man is said to be senseless and rapt away, his object being
either some unintelligible form or some formless intelligible. Remember,
God requires every spiritual man to love him with all the powers of his soul.
‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,’ he says. Some squander
all their soul-powers on their outward man. Namely, those whose thoughts and
feelings hinge on temporal goods, all unwitting of an inner man. And even as
the virtuous man will now and then deprive his outward self of all the powers
of the soul what time he is embarking on some high adventure, so bestial man
will rob his inner self of all its soul-powers to expend them on his outer man.
