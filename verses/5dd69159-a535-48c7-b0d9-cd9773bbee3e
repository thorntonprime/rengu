Title: Life's Bestowal of Riches
---
You might notice that in some ways the effects of our winter experiences are
similar. You write of a constant sense of fullness, an almost overabundance
of inner being, which from the outset counterbalances and compensates all
deprivations and losses that might possibly come. In the course of my work
this last long winter, I have experienced a truth more completely than ever
beforeï¼š that life's bestowal of riches already surpasses any subsequent
impoverishment. What, then, remains to be feared? Only that we might forget
this! But around and within us, how much it helps to remember!
