Nothing is left to Saichi,
Except a joyful heart nothing is left to him.
Neither good nor bad has he, all is taken away from him;
Nothing is left to him!
To have nothing -- how completely satisfying!
Everything has been carried away by the ‘Namu-amida-butsu.’
He is thoroughly at home with himself;
This is indeed the ‘Namu-amida-butsu!’
