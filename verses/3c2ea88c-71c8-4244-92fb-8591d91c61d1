God is nearer to us than our own Soul; for He is the Ground in whom our Soul
standeth, and He is the Mean that keepeth the Substance and the Sense-nature
together so that they shall never dispart. For our Soul sitteth in God in
very rest, and our Soul standeth in God in very strength, and our Soul is
kindly rooted in God in endless love; and therefore if we will have knowledge
of our Soul, and communing and dalliance therewith, it behoveth to seek unto
our Lord God in whom it is enclosed.
