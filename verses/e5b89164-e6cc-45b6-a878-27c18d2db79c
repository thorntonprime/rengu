\"Then I played it with unwearying notes and tuned it to the command of
spontaneity. Therefore there seemed to be a chaos where things grow in
thickets together, a maturity where nothing takes form, a universal
plucking where nothing gets pulled, a clouded obscurity where there is
no sound. It moved in no direction at all, rested in mysterious shadow.
Some called it death, some called it life, some called it fruit, some
called it flower. It flowed and scattered, and bowed before no constant
tone. The world, perplexed by it, went to the sage for instruction, for
the sage is the comprehender of true form and the completer of fate.

vital organs are all complete this may be called the music of Heaven.
Wordless, it delights the mind. Therefore the lord of Yen sang its
praises thus 'Listen - you do not hear its sound; look - you do not
see its form. It fills all Heaven and earth, enwraps all the six
directions.' You wanted to hear it but had no way to go about it. That
was why you felt confused.
