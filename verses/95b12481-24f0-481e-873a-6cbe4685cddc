As long as you do not subdue the mind, you cannot get rid of your desires;
and unless you suppress your desires, you cannot control your restless mind.

Hence, knowledge of Truth, subjection of the mind and abandonment of desires
are the joint causes of spiritual bliss, which is unattainable by the
practice of any one of them singly.
