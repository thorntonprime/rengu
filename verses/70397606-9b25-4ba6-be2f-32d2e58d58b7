My Shaykh used to say： ‘One year a meeting of the saints of God took
place in the midst of the desert, and I accompanied my spiritual director,
Husri, to that spot. I saw some of them approaching on camels, some borne on
thrones, and some flying, but Husri paid no heed to them. Then I saw a youth
with torn shoes and a broken staff. His feet could scarcely support him,
and his head was bare and his body emaciated. As soon as he appeared Husri
sprang up and ran to meet him and led him to a lofty seat. This astonished
me, and afterwards I questioned the Shaykh about the youth. He replied：
‘He is one of God’s saints who does not follow saintship, but saintship
follows him; and he pays no attention to miracles.’
