Chuang Tzu said, "You certainly are dense when it comes to using big
things! In Sung there was a man who was skilled at making a salve to
prevent chapped hands, and generation after generation his family made
a living by bleaching silk in water. A traveler heard about the salve
and offered to buy the prescription for a hundred measures of gold. The
man called everyone to a family council. 'For generations we've been
bleaching sills and we've never made more than a few measures of gold,'
he said. 'Now, if we sell our secret, we can make a hundred measures in
one morning. Let's let him have it!' The traveler got the salve and
introduced it to the king of Wu, who was having trouble with the state
of Yueh. The king put the man in charge of his troops, and that winter
they fought a naval battle with the men of Yueh and gave them a bad
beating. A portion of the conquered territory was awarded to the man
as a fief. The salve had the power to prevent chapped hands in either
case; but one man used it to get a fief, while the other one never got
beyond silk bleaching - because they used it in different ways. Now you
had a gourd big enough to hold five piculs. Why didn't you think of
making it into a great tub so you could go floating around the rivers
and lakes, instead of worrying because it was too big and unwieldy to
dip into things! Obviously you still have a lot of underbrush in your
head!"
