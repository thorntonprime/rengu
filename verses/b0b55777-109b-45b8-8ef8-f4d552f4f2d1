Title: The Sin of Wanting to Be Heard
---
The question of writing： definitely it has to be cut down, or changed.

Someone accused me of being a “high priest" of creativity. Or, at least,
of allowing people to regard me, as one. This is perhaps true.

The sin of wanting to be a pontiff, of wanting to be heard, of wanting
converts, disciples. Being in a Cloister, I thought I did not want this. Of
course I did, and everyone knows it.

St. William, says the Breviary this night, when death approached, took off
his pontifical vestments (what he was doing with them on in bed I can‘t
imagine) and by his own efforts got to the floor and died.

So I am like him, in bed with a miter on. What am I going to do about it?

I have got to face the fact that there is in me a desire for survivaI as
pontiff, prophet, and writer, and this has to be renounced before I can be
myself at last.
