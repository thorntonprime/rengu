Heaven and Earth are not kind： The ten thousand things are straw dogs to
 them.
The Sage is not kind： People are straw dogs to him.
Yet Heaven and Earth And all the space between Are like a bellows： Empty
 but inexhaustible, Always producing more.
Longwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.
