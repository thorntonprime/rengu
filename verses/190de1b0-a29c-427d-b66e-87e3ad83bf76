Mazu said to Baizhang, “In the future, ifyou travel to other places, how
do you intend to help the people?’ Baizhang picked up a Hywhisk and held
it upright. Mazu said, “If you use it in that way, what other way can it
be used?" Baizhang placed the whisk back on its stand. Mazu suddenly let
out an earth, shaking shout (katsu) that left Baizhang deaffor three days.

You tell me： was his shout approval, disapproval, both approval and
disapproval, neither, or was it an entirely different matter?

In the case of master Linji, his master. Huangbo, questioned him on his
visit to the hermit Daiyu：

Huangbo said, “What did Daiyu say?" Linji recounted his meeting with Daiyu
lluangbo said. “That old fellow Daiyu talks too much. Next time I see him
I‘ll give him a painful swat." Linji said. “Why wait until later? Here's
a swat right now." Linji then hit Master I luangbo. Huangbo yelled, “This
crazy fellow has come here and grabbed the tiger‘s whiskers! Take him to
the practice hall."

If you wish to understand the teachings ofeither ofthese masters, you must
see them from the perspective of their time, place, and position. I low do
you see from the perspective oftheir time place and position? Forget the
selfand be the koan.
