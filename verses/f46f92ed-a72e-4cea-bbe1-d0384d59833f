Why should such fears invade me now
That writes on her? to whom do bow
The souls of all the just, whose place
Is next to God's and in his face
All creatures and delights doth see
As darling of the Trinity;
To whom the Hierarchy doth throng,
And for whom Heaven is all one song.
Joys should possess my spirit here.
But pious joys are mixed with fear;
Put off thy shoe, 'tis holy ground,
For here the flaming Bush is found.
The mystic rose, the Ivory Tower,
The morning Star and David's bower.
The rod of Moses and of Jesse.
The fountain sealed, Gideon's fleece,
A woman clothed with the Sun,
The beauteous throne of Salomon,
The garden shut, the living spring.
The Tabernacle of the King,
The Altar breathing sacred fume.
The Heaven distilling honeycomb.
The untouched lily, full of dew.
A Mother, yet a Virgin too.
Before and after she brought forth
(Our ransom of eternal worth)
Both God and man. What voice can sing
This mystery, or Cherub's wing
Lend from his golden stock a pen
To write, how Heaven came down to men?
Here fear and wonder so advance
My soul, it must obey a trance.
