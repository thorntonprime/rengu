Title: Wooden Walkingstick
---
Friend, you are Moses.
I am his wooden walking-stick.

Sometimes that simple use.
Other times, a dragon earth-energy.

You decide.
There is no time or place in the air you inhabit.
Days you give me, I give back to you.
I have seen your unseeable beauty
and taken report without words to my heart,
which became all eye with the news.
Long life to eyes,
says my heart now over and over.

Hundreds of candles search the turning sky.
No bread in the basket, no money, no home.
Family, work in shambles,
with your light shining on the ruins.

Crushed in grief's mortar,
let me be medicine for other eyes.

What is the soul? Half a leaf.
What is the heart? A flower opening.

I am not the one speaking here.
Even so, I will stop.
Anything anyone says is your voice.
