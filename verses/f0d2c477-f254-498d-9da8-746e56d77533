Something unformed and complete Before heaven and Earth were born, Solitary
 and silent, Stands alone and unchanging. Pervading all things without
 limit. It is like the mother of all things under heaven,
But I don't know its name - Better call it Tao. Better call it great.
Great means passing on. Passing on means going far. Going far means
 returning.
Therefore Tao is great, And heaven, And earth, And humans. Four great
 things in the world. Aren't humans one of them?
Humans follow earth Earth follows heaven Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows
 its own nature.
