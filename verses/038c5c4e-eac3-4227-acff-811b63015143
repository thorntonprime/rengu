Regeneration or the renewal of our first birth and state is something
entirely distinct from this first sudden conversion or call to
repentance; ... it is not a thing done in an instant, but is a certain
process, a gradual release from our captivity and disorder, consisting
of several stages and degrees, both of death and life, which the soul
must go through before it can have thoroughly put off the old man.
