It is, therefore, exceeding good and beneficial to us to discover this
dark, disordered fire of our soul; because when rightly known and
rightly dealt with, it can as well be made the foundation of Heaven as
it is of hell. For when the fire and strength of the soul is sprinkled
with the blood of the Lamb, then its fire becomes a fire of light, and
its strength is changed into a strength of triumphing love, and will
be fitted to have a place amongst those flames of love that wait about
the throne of God.
