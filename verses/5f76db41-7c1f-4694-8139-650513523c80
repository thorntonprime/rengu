Sincere words and not pretty. Pretty words are not sincere.
Good people do not quarrel. Quarrelsome people are not good.
The wise are not learned. The learned are not wise.
The Sage is not acquisitive - Has enough By doing for others, Has even more
 By giving to others.
Heaven's Tao Benefits and does not harm. The Sage's Tao Acts and does not
 contend.
