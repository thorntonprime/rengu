\"Emperors and kings have different ways of ceding their thrones; the
Three Dynasties had different rules of succession. Those who went
against the times and flouted custom were called usurpers; those who
went with the times and followed custom were called companions of
righteousness. Be quiet, be quiet, O Lord of the River! How could you
understand anything about the gateway of nobility and meanness or the
house of great and small?"
