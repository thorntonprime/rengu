We have not kept to ourselves any of the Hierarchic Utterances which have
been handed down to us but have imparted them without adulteration both to
yourselves and to other holy men, and will continue so to do as long as we
have the power to speak and you to hear. So will we do no despite unto the
tradition, unless strength fail us for the perception or the utterance of
these Truths. But be these matters as God wills that we should do or speak.
