(The contents of memory) must be drawn together again, that they may be known：
that is to say, they must as it were be collected together from their
dispersion： whence the word ‘cogitation’ is derived. For cogo (collect) and
cogito (re-collect) have the same relation to each other as ago and agito,
facio and factito. But the mind hath appropriated to itself this word
(cogitation), so that, not what is ‘collected’ any how, but what is
"re-collected', i.e.  brought together, in the mind, is properly said to be
cogitated, or thought upon. ...

Great is the power of memory, a fearful thing. O my God, a deep and boundless
manifoldness; and this thing is the mind, and this am I myself. What am I then.
O my God? What nature am I? A life various and manifold, and exceeding immense.
