Title: A Door Opens
---
A door opens in the center of our being and we seem to fall through it into
immense depths which, although they are infinite, are all accessible to us; all
eternity seems to have become ours in this one placid and breathless contact.

God touches us with a touch that is emptiness, and empties us. He
moves us with a simplicity that simplifies us. All variety, all complexity, all
paradox, all multiplicity cease. Our mind swims in the air of an understanding,
a reality that is dark and serene and includes in itselfeverything. Nothing
more is desired. Nothing more is wanting. Our only sorrow, ifsorrow be possible
at all, is the awareness that we ourselves still live outside of God.

For already a supernatural instinct teaches us that the function of this
abyss of freedom, which has been opened out within our own midst, is to
draw us utterly out of our own selfhood and into its own immensity of liberty
and joy.
