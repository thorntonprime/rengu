Tao endures without a name. Though simple and slight, No one under heaven
 can master it.
If kings and lords could posses it, All beings would become their guests.
Heaven and earth together Would drip sweet dew Equally on all people
 Without regulation.
Begin to make order and names arise. Names lead to more names - And to
 knowing when to stop.
Tao's presence in this world Is like valley streams Flowing into rivers and
 seas.
