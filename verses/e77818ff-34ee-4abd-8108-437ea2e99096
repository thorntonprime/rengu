  Title: The Essential Mystics, Poets, Saints and Sages
---
The love a holy person has for all beings
has an effect on those beings.
If this were not the case,
the sage would not even realize he loved others.
But such a person does not need confirmation
of his love. It is simply there,
and all of humanity may rest within it.
