When my soul is in Eden with our first parents. I myself am there in a blessed
manner. When I walk with Enoch, and see his translation. I am transported
with him. The present age is too little to contain it. I can visit Noah
in his ark, and swim upon the waters of the deluge. I can see Moses with
his rod, and the children of Israel passing through the sea; I can enter
into Aaronâ€™s Tabernacle, and admire the mysteries of the holy place. I
can travel over the Land of Canaan, and see it overflowing with milk and
honey; I can visit Solomon in his glory, and go into his temple, and view
the sitting of his servants, and admire the magnificence and glory of his
kingdom. No creature but one like unto the Holy Angels can see into all
ages. Sure this power was not given in vain, but for some wonderful purpose;
worthy of itself to enjoy and fathom. Would men consider what God hath done,
they would be ravished in spirit with the glory of His doings.
