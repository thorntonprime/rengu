Prince Mou leaned on his armrest and gave a great sigh, and then he
looked up at the sky and laughed, saying, "Haven't you ever heard about
the frog in the caved-in well? He said to the great turtle of the
Eastern Sea, 'What fun I have! I come out and hop around the railing of
the well, or I go back in and take a rest in the wall where a tile has
fallen out. When I dive into the water, I let it hold me up under the
armpits and support my chin, and when I slip about in the mud, I bury
my feet in it and let it come up over my ankles. I look around at the
mosquito larvae and the crabs and polliwogs and I see that none of them
can match me. To have complete command of the water of one whole valley
and to monopolize all the joys of a caved-in well-this is the best
there is! Why don't you come some time and see for yourself?'
