For a person rightly to be adjudged a heretic he must fulfil five
conditions. First, there must be an error in his reasoning. Secondly,
that error must be in matters concerning the faith, either being
contrary to the teaching of the Church as to the true faith, or
against sound morality and therefore not leading to the attainment of
eternal life. Thirdly, the error must lie in one who has professed the
Catholic faith, for otherwise he would be a Jew or a Pagan, not a
heretic. Fourthly, the error must be of such a nature that he who
holds it must still confess some of the truth of Christ as touching
either His Godhead or His Manhood ; for if a man wholly denies the
faith, he is an apostate. Fifthly, he must pertinaciously and
obstinately hold to and follow that error.
