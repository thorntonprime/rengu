Oh I've been poor before, for sure ...
But today, I'm broke, and cold.
Whatever I've tried hasn't worked like I planned,
and the ways that I went left me lost
in the mud, and my boots sunk in over their tops ...
On festival days, when the food is for free,
it's just a full bellyache for me.
Since I lost that pretty cat,
the rats have my pot under siege.
