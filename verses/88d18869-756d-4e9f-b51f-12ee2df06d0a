All time is comprised in the present or ‘now’. The past was present,
the future shall be present, so that time is only a methodical arrangement
of the present. The past and the future, in consequence, are the development
of the present; the present comprises all present times, and present times
are a regular and orderly development of it; only the present is to be found
in them. The present, therefore, in which all times are included, is one;
it is unity itself.
