Let emptiness fill you.
Let stillness reign within.

Now,
as creation unfolds, observe its return as well.
For as all creatures flourish,
so is each returning to its source.
All returns to stillness.
Thus nature is renewed.
Thus nature endures.

Appreciating the perpetual invites enlightenment.
Recklessly ignoring what endures invites catastrophe.

Appreciating the perpetual opens the mind.
An open mind fosters perspective;
perspective, transcendence;
transcendence, divinity;
divinity, oneness with the Wayï¼š
the Way which is everlasting.

Even as bodies die and decay,
the Way will ever be the Way.
