When the mind, completely subdued, rests in Self alone, free from longing
for all objects of desire, then he (the Sannyâsi, the Yogi) is said to be
a Yukta (steadfast in Self-knowledge).

As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker, the same simile is
used to define a Yogi of subdued mind, practising union with the Self.

In that state, when the mind is completely subdued by the practice of Yoga
and has attained serenity, in that state, seeing Self by the self, he is
satisfied in the Self alone.

In that state, transcending the senses, he feels that infinite bliss which is
perceived by the purified understanding; knowing that and being established
therein, he never falls back from his real state;

After having attained which, no other gain seems greater; being established
wherein, he is not overwhelmed even by great sorrow.
