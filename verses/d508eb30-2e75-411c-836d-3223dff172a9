Title: Only One Is Your Teacher
---
The feast of Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor, falls this year
on the Tuesday ofthe Second Week in Lent. So there is a very striking
coincidence in the liturgy： the Gospel of the feast speaks of the true
Teachers, the salt of the earth, who “do and teach” and whose works
shine before men.The Gospel for Tuesday in the Second Week of Lent speaks of
the false teachers who have sat in the chair of Moses and have not done the
works of Moses, that is, they have not kept the laws they talked about. Yet
they have done works that have been dazzling in the eyes of men and have
done them in order to shine before men, to have the first places in the
synagogues and to be called Rabbi.The theme of both the feast and the ferial
day is summed up in the line Unus est Magister vester, Christus： “Only
one is your Teacher, Christ.” It is Jesus Who teaches us in and through
St.Thomas Aquinas and in St. Bonaventure and St. Augustine and in all the
other doctors of the Church. We have no other Father and no other Doctor
than Christ. It is jesus Whose works shine in the lives of the saints. It
is Jesus Who manifests Himself to us through the words of the Fathers and
the theologians.The false doctors preach their own sanctity and Christ is
not seen or heard in them. But the true teachers preach the sanctity of
Christ, and He shines through them. He it is Whose Truth has made them holy.
