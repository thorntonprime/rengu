Mother Divine, grant that today may bring to us a completer consecration
to thy Will, a more integral gift of ourselves to thy work, a more total
forgetfulness of self, a greater illumination, a purer love. Grant that
in a communion growing ever deeper, more constant and entire we may be
united always more and more closely to thee and become thy servitors
worthy of Thee. Remove from us all egoism, root out all petty vanity,
greed and obscurity. May we be all ablaze with thy divine Love; make us
thy torches in the world.
