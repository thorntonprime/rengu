Tzu-ch'i of Nan-po was wandering around the Hill of Shang when he saw a
huge tree there, different from all the rest. A thousand teams of
horses could have taken shelter under it and its shade would have
covered them all. Tzu-ch'i said, "What tree is this? It must certainly
have some extraordinary usefulness!" But, looking up, he saw that the
smaller limbs were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters, and
looking down, he saw that the trunk was pitted and rotten and could not
be used for coffins. He licked one of the leaves and it blistered his
mouth and made it sore. He sniffed the odor and it was enough to make a
man drunk for three days. "It turns out to be a completely unusable
tree," said Tzu-ch'i, "and so it has been able to grow this big. Aha !
- it is this unusableness that the Holy Man makes use of!"
