Woe unto the man or woman who suffers from mental indigestion. For it is as
the farmer who sows various varieties of seed in the same rows. What would
be the crop to come forth? So it is with manâ€™s thinking. Find the choice
seed and plant it in deep furrows with love. Nurture them with patience and
sincerity and there can be no lack, no want, no limitation.
