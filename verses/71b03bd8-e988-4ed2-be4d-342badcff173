One day an eagle said with pride： “None can soar up like me!
Sick shivering and giddiness reign where I dare to go.
My Adriatic is the air, my gondola the cloud,
My canopy a background like purple satin’s glow.”

She spoke and looked again upon her ornaments of power,
And shook her wings as shakes a queen her mantle, royally.
“No other can soar up like me!” Into the clouds she flew,
Repeating ever while she rose： “None can soar up like me!”

“Who art thou?”
  “A dry leaf.”
    “And whence?"
      “I come from far above.”

“And hast thou wings?”
  “Nay!”
    “Wingless leaf that in my path I find,
Who has breathed into thee this breath which gives the power to rise
Yet higher in the ether than my sovereignty?"
  “The wind!”

You hear it, 0 ye ragged men in yonder neighboring street!
Take courage, all ye foolish ones! Be faint of heart no more,
Ye ignorant! When o’er the world a strong, mad whirlwind sweeps,
Then higher than the eagles, the dry leaves rise and soar!
