What does the word “soul” mean? ... No one can give a definition of the
soul. But we know what it feels like. The soul is the sense of something
higher than ourselves, something that stirs in us thoughts, hopes, and
aspirations which go out to the world ofgoodness, truth, and beauty. The soul
is a burning desire to breathe in this world of light and never to lose it --
to remain children oflight.
