Confucius said to Lao Tan, "Here's a man who works to master the Way as
though he were trying to talk down an opponent making the unacceptable
acceptable, the not so, so. As the rhetoricians say, he can separate
'hard' from 'white' as clearly as though they were dangling from the
eaves there. Can a man like this be called a sage?"
