We must understand that the Order and Symmitry of the Universe is so setled
by the Lawes of Creation, that the lowest things (the Subcelestiall or
Elementary Region) should be immediately subservient to the Midle; the Midle
(or Celestiall) to those above; and these (the Supercelestiall or Intelligible)
to the Supreame Rulers becke. With this it is further to be knowne that these
Superiours and Inferiours have an Analogicall likenesse, and by a secret Bond
have likewise a fast coherence between themselvs through insensible Mediums,
freely combiening in Obedience to the same supreme Ruler, and also to the
benefit of Nature; Insomuch, that if we take the said Harmony in the Reverse,
we shall finde that things Supercelestiall may be drawne down by Celestiall,
and Supernaturall, by Naturall. For this is the Maxim of old Hermes, Quod
est superius, est sicut id quod est inferius.

And upon this ground Wisemen3 conceive it no way Irrationall that it should
be possible for us to ascend by the same degrees through each world, to the
very Originall world it selfe, the Maker of all things and first Cause.
