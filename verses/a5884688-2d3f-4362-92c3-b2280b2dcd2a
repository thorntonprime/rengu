The quality of love stilleth our will, and maketh us long only for
what we have, and giveth us no other thirst.

Did we desire to be more aloft, our longings were discordant from his
will who here assorteth us,

and for that, thou wilt see, there is no room within these circles, if
of necessity we have our being here in love, and if thou think again
what is love's nature.

Nay. 'tis the essence of this blessed being to hold ourselves within
the divine will, whereby our own wills are themselves made one.
