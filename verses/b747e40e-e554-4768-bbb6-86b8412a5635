In Cheng there was a shaman of the gods named Chi Hsien. He could tell
whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or
unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the
year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the
people of Cheng saw him, they dropped everything and ran out of his
way. Lieh Tzu went to see him and was completely intoxicated.
Returning, he said to Hu Tzu, "I used to think, Master, that your Way
was perfect. But now I see there is something even higher!"
