Title: A Child's Mere Pencil Sketch
---
A child's mere pencil sketch is every religion's best description of God.

Who then will ever take issue or argue over such a na√Øve and innocent portrait?

Surely the intelligent, compassionate, and wise would not bother with such.

And who with a living heart would not encourage a child's art in hopes that
someday,

someday a great truth and work might be gifted to our world through their
soul's strength, insights and talents,

and liberate and unite the spheres within a body, for inherent in true art is
emancipation.

And do you have worlds within your self? Indeed. The night sky a microcosm of
you.

The oil in the lamp the sun burns comes from forests you once were, from rich
deposits you left.
