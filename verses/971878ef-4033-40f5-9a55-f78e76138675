God is in all things, as their root and the source of their being. There is
nothing that has not a source; but the source itself springs from nothing but
itself, if it is the source of all else. God then is like the unit of number.
For the unit, being the source of all numbers, and the root of them all,
contains every number within itself, and is contained by none of them; it
generates every number, and is generated by no other number.
