    Title: Uncollected Poems
By: Rainer Maria Rilke
Title: Lifting My Eyes
Description: January 2
Format: Verse
---
Lifting my eyes from the book, from the tightly sequenced lines
to the full and perfect night：
Oh how like the stars my buried feelings break free,
as if a bouquet of wildflowers
had come untied：

The upswing of the light ones, the bowing sway of the heavy ones
and the delicate ones' timid curve.
Everywhere joy in relation and nowhere grasping;
world in abundance and earth enough.
