In a sermon on the Day of Atonement, the Rabbi of Ger warned against
self-torture：

“He who has done ill and talks about it and thinks about it all the time
does not cast the base thing he did out of his thoughts, and whatever
one thinks, therein one is, one‘s soul is wholly and utterly in what
one thinks, and so he dwells in baseness. He will certainly not be able
to turn, for his spirit will grow coarse and his heart stubborn, and in
addition to this he may be overcome by gloom. What would you? Rake the
muck this way, rake the muck that way -- it will always be muck. Have I
sinned, or have I not sinned -- what does Heaven get out of it? In the
time I am brooding over it I could be stringing pearls for the delight of
Heaven. That is why it is written： ‘Depart from evil and do good --
turn wholly away from evil, do not dwell upon it, and do good. You have
done wrong? Then counteract it by doing right." [Way, 36-37]
