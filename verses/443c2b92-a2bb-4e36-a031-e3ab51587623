As a devotee cannot live without God, so also God cannot live without His
devotee.  Then the devotee becomes the sweetness, and God its enjoyer. The
devotee becomes the lotus, and God the bee, it is the Godhead that has become
these two in order to enjoy Its own Bliss. That is the significance of the
episode of Râdhâ and Krishna.
