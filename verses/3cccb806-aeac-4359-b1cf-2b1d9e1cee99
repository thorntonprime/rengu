Title: Saints Bowing in the Mountains
---
Do you know how beautiful you are? I think not, my dear. For as you
talk of God,

I see great parades with colorful bands streaming from your mind and
heart,

carrying wonderful and secret messages to every corner of this world.

I see saints bowing in the mountains, hundreds of miles away, to the
wonder

of sounds that break into light from your most common words.

Speak to me of your mother, your father, your cousins, and your
friends.

Tell me of animals and birds you know. Awaken your legion of wings --
let them soar wild and free in the sky

and begin to sing to God. Let's all begin to sing to God!

Do you know how beautiful you are? I think not, my dear.

Yet Hafiz could set you upon a stage and worship you forever
