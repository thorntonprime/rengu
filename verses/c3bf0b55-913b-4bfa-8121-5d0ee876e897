Title: As Night Descends
---
I sweep. I spread a blanket in the sun. I cut grass behind the
cabin. Soon I will bring the blanket in again and make the bed. The sun is
overclouded. Perhaps there will be rain. A bell rings in the monastery. A
tractor growls in the valley. Soon I will cut bread, eat supper, say psalms,
sit in the back room as the sun sets, as the birds sing outside the window,
as silence descends on the valley, as night descends. As night descends
on a nation intent upon ruin, upon destruction, blind, deaf to protest,
crafty, powerful, unintelligent. It is necessary to be alone, to be
not part of this, to be in the exile of silence, to be, in a manner of
speaking, a political prisoner. No matter where in the world he may be,
no matter what may be his power of protest, or his means of expression,
the poet finds himself ultimately where I am. Alone, silent, with the
obligation of being very careful not to say what he does not mean, not
to let himself be persuaded to say merely what another wants him to say,
not to say what his own past work has led others to expect him to say.

The poet has to be free from everyone else, and first of all from himself,
because it is through this “self” that he is captured by others. Freedom
is found under the dark tree that springs up in the center of the night
and of silence, the paradise tree, the web mundi, which is also the Cross.
