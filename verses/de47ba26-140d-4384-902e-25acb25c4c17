A large state is the lower reaches of a riverï¼š
The place where all the streams of the world unite.

In the union of the world,
The female always gets the better of the male by stillness.

Being still, she takes the lower position.

Hence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small
 state;
The small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the
 large state.

Thus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;
The other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.
All that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;
All that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the
 other.
If each of the two wants to find its proper place,
It is meet that the large should take the lower position.
