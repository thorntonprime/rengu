  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=Beauty and Knowledge
By: John Smith the Platonist
---
This divine knowledge makes us amorous of divine beauty, beautiful and lovely;
and this divine love and purity reciprocally exalts divine knowledge; both of
them growing up together, like that [eros] and [anteros] that Pausanias
sometimes speaks of.
