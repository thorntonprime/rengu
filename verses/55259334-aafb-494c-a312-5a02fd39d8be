Commentary: "According to Taylor, an allusion to Protogonus (=firsl\

It is by no means wonderful if this monad comprehends the whole intellectual
pentad, viz, essence, motion, permanency, sameness, and difference, without
division, and in the most profound union; since through this union all these
are after a manner one. For all things are there without separation.
