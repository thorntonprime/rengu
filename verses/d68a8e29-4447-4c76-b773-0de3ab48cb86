‘Don’t be angry,’ said the Planet. ‘As you haven’t been to the Hall
of Heaven before and haven’t yet been given a name, the Guardians don’t
know who you are, and are quite right not to let you pass (through the Gate
of Heaven). When you have seen the Emperor and received your appointment,
they’ll let you go in and out as you please.’ ‘That’s as may be.’
said Monkey, ‘but at the present moment I can’t get in.’
