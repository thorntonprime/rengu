This marvellous union of body, soul, and spirit, this Divine glorification
and exaltation of the elect, is a consideration fraught with reverential and
unspeakable awe (like the sight of the final chemical transformation); it
is a sight at which the very angels will stand rapt in inexpressible wonder;
and then they will see us pass into the heavens to reign with Christ, and with
them, and the ministering spirits, in everlasting glory, and joy unspeakable,
world without end.
