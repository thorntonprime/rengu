A man after fourteen years of hard asceticism in a lonely forest obtained at
last the power of walking over the waters. Overjoyed at this acquisition, he
went to his guru, and told him of his grand feat. At this the master replied,
"My poor boy, what thou hast accomplished after fourteen years’ arduous
labor, ordinary men do the same by paying a penny to the boatman.”
