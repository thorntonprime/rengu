For the Soul is many things; and each of us is an Intellectual Cosmos,
linked to this world by what is lowest in us, but by what is highest
to the Divine Intellect. By all that is intellective we are
permanently in that higher realm, but at the fringe of the
intellectual we are fettered to the lower.

What, then, is the achieved Sage?

One whose Act is determined by that higher phase of the Soul. It does
not suffice to perfect virtue to have only this spirit as cooperator
in the life; the acting force of the Sage is the Divine Mind ( vovs )
which therefore is itself his presiding spirit, guided by a presiding
spirit of its own. no other than the very Divinity.
