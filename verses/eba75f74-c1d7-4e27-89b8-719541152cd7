“He is fainting!” said one of the messmates, " quick! some water!”
The steward immediately hurried to the topman with the basin.

Cuticle took the topman by the wrist, and feeling it awhile, observed,
“Don’t be alarmed, men,” addressing the two messmates; " he'll
recover presently; this fainting very generally takes place.” And he
stood for a moment, tranquilly eyeing the patient, Now the Surgeon of the
Fleet and the topman presented a spectacle which, to a reflecting mind,
was better than a churchyard sermon on the mortality of man.

Here was a sailor, who, four days previous, had stood erect -- a pillar
of life -- with an arm like a royalmast, and a thigh like a Windlass, But
the slightest conceivable finger-touch of a bit of crooked trigger had
eventuated in stretching him out, more helpless than an hour-old babe,
with a blasted thigh, utterly drained of its brawn, And who was it that
now stood over him like a superior being, and, as if clothed himself with
the attributes of immortality, indifferently discoursed of carving up
his broken flesh, and thus piecing out his abbreviated days? Who was it,
that, in capacity of surgeon, seemed enacting the part of a Regenerator
of life? The withered, shrunken, one-eyed, toothless, hairless Cuticle;
with a trunk half dead -- a memento mori to behold!
