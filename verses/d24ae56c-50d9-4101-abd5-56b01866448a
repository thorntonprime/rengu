The Lord will draw us and securely lead us to Himself, in a way
contrary to all our natural will, until He have divested us thereof,
and consumed it and made it thoroughly subject unto the Divine will.
For this is His willï¼š that we should cease to regard our own wishes
or dislikes; that it should become a light matter to us whether He
give or take away, whether we have abundance or suffer want, and let
all things go, if only we may receive and apprehend God Himself, that
whether things please or displease us. we may leave all things to
take their course and cleave to Him alone.
