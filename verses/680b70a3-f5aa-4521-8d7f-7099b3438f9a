    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Echoing the Ocean's Vastness
---
The silence must be immense where you are living right now, immense
enough to allow such tumult of sound and motion. And if you think that
in the ocean's vastness there exists not only the present moment but
reverberations of primordial harmonies, then you can be patient and
trust the great and indelible solitude at work in you. This will be a
nameless influence in all that lies ahead for you to experience and
accomplish, rather as if the blood of our ancestors moves in us and
combines with ours in the unique, unrepeatable being that at every
turn of our life we are.
