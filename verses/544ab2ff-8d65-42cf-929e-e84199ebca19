A lovely little icon arrived that Bob Rambusch got for us in Salonika, I
believe. He had it cleaned in New York and here it is -- not astonishingly
beautiful but simple and holy and joyous. It radiates a kind of joy
and strength that one would not look for or see, if one looked only
superficially. I blessed this icon today (it had been sold and lost its
consecration by the defiling touch of commerce) and I prayed aloud before
it an Eastern prayer and hymn to the icon ofOur Lady of Kazan. Her coming
is a great grace -- her presence a great comfort. I have placed the icon
over the altar of Our Lady in the novitiate chapel.

Why was I always half-convinced I would die young? Perhaps a kind of
superstition -- the fear of admitting a hope of life which, if admitted,
might have to be dashed. But now “I have lived” a fair span of life and,
whether or not the fact be important, nothing can alter it. It is certain,
infallible -- even though that too is only a kind of dream. If I don’t make
it to sixty-five, it matters less. I can relax. But life is a gift I am
glad of, and I do not curse the day when I was born. On the contrary, if I
had never been born I would never have had friends to love and be loved by,
never have made mistakes to learn from, never have seen new countries, and,
as for what I may have suffered, it is inconsequential and indeed part of
the great good which life has been and will, I hope, continue to be.
