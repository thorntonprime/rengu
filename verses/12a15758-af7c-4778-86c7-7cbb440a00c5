I will bless the name of Amon. Heaven shall hear the voice of my praise,
and over the breadth of the earth shall it be heard. To the north and to
the south I will declare his glory.

Let him be known to all people. Declare him to your sons and daughters,
to great and to small, and to the generations that are yet unborn. Shout
his name to the fishes in the stream and to the birds of the air. Declare
him to the wise and to the foolish. Let him be known to all people.

Lord of those whose tongues are silent, thou who protectest the humble. Lo. I
called upon thee when I was in trouble and thou savedst me. Thou givest
life and strength to the wretched and savest those who are in bonds. For
thou art merciful and gracious to all who call upon thee.
