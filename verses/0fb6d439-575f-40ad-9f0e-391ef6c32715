  - Body: I promise. O Beelzebub, that I will serve you all my life
      and give you my heart and my soul, all the faculties of my soul,
      all the senses of my body, all my works, all desires and yearnings,
      and all the affections of my heart, all my thoughts. I give you all
      the parts of my body, all the drops of my blood, all my nerves, all my
      bones, all my veins. ... I give you my life for your service, even
      if I had a thousand lives I would give them all to you.

Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts! unsex me here.
And fill me from the crown to the toe top full
Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood.
Stop up the access and passage to remorse.
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers.
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark.
To cry, ‘Hold, hold!’
