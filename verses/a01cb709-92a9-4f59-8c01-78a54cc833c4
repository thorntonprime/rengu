The countenance of wisdom is not scowling and severe, contracted by deep
thought and depression of spirit, but on the contrary cheerful and tranquil,
full of joy and gladness, feelings which often prompt a man to be sportive

a dignified self-respect, a harmony like that of a lyre tuned to give forth
a single melody by a blending of answering notes.
