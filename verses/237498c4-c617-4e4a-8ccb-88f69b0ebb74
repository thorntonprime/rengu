\"Ah," said Confucius, "you will probably go and get yourself executed,
that's all. The Way doesn't want things mixed in with it. When it
becomes a mixture, it becomes many ways; with many ways, there is a lot
of bustle; and where there is a lot of bustle, there is trouble -
trouble that has no remedy! The Perfect Man of ancient times made sure
that he had it in himself before he tried to give it to others. When
you're not even sure what you've got in yourself, how do you have time
to bother about what some tyrant is doing?
