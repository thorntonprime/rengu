Devotee： How to know the ‘I’?

Maharshi： The 'I'  -- ‘I’ is always there. There is no knowing it. It is not a
new knowledge acquired. What is new and not here and now will be evanescent
only. The ‘I’ is always there. There is obstruction to its knowledge and it is
called ignorance. Remove the ignorance and knowledge shines forth. In fact this
ignorance or even knowledge is not for Atma. They are only overgrowths to be
cleared off. That is why ‘Atma' is said to be beyond knowledge and ignorance.
It remains as it naturally is -- that is all.
