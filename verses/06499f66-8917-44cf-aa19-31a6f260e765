Title: What Makes Nature Good
---
This is the basis on which human nature
and spirit are wholly goodï¼š
  a mind completely devoted to God.

Direct your being to this end,
that God shall be great in you,
so that all your comings and goings,
your zeal and fervor are toward God.

Hold fast to God
  God will add all good things.
Seek God,
  And you will find all of God's goodness.
Cleave to God,
  And God will cleave to you with virtue.

What you once sought, now seeks you;
What once you pursued, now pursues you;
What once you fled, now flees you.
Come to God,
  and all goodness will follow,
  and all that is strange and alien will melt away.
