Free flight inwards.
Fleeing through all nights.
The realms of darkness in one taught throat.
Further into blackness
Razor sharp against the feathers.
Then out, naked.
It is called light, the brightness.
Blinding when one does not see the whiteness
In the light.
It is nothing
And yet, it is what all live by
the lucid darkness, relentless
silk and stone
feathers that fall
snow on eyelids
The ceiling oflife opens slowly
I move upwards
And rotate out into nothing.
Oh -- my dark flight
Towards the sea of freedom -- so whiteï¼š
not milk, not snow.
No, but the brightness of the light,
a body with white blood.
A glow that cannot be extinguished.
Lighthouse in the world.
