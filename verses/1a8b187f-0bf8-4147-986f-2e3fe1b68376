Govern big countries Like you cook a little fish.
When Tao harmonizes the world, Demons lose their power.
Not that demons lose their power, but their power does not harm people. Not
 that their power does not harm people, but the Sage does not harm people.
If neither does harm, Then Te flows and returns.
