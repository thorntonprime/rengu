    Title: Letters to a Young Poet
Title: Patience Is All
---
Do not measure in terms of time： one year or ten years means nothing. For the
artist there is no counting or tallying up; just ripening like the tree that
does not force its sap and endures the storms of spring without fearing that
summer will not come. But it will come. It comes, however, only to the patient
ones who stand there as if all eternity lay before them -- vast, still,
untroubled. I learn this every day of my life, I learn it from hardships I am
grateful for： patience is all.
