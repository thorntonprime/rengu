I would be a protector of the unprotected, a guide of wayfarers, a ship, a
dyke, and a bridge for them who seek the further Shore; a lamp for them who
need a lamp, a bed for them who need a bed, a slave for all beings who need a
slave. I would be a magic gem, a lucky jar, a spell of power, a sovereign balm,
a wishing-tree, a cow of plenty, for embodied beings. As the earth and other
elements are for the manifold service of the countless creatures dwelling in
the whole of space, so may I in various wise support the whole sphere of life
lodged in space, until all be at peace. As the Blessed of old took the Thought
of Enlightenment and held fast to the rule for Sons of Enlightenment in the
order thereof, so do I frame the Thought of Enlightenment for the weal of the
world, and so will I observe these rules in their sequence.
