It is very important for a person who wishes to ‘lament' to receive
aid and advice from a wichasha wakan (holy man), so that everything is
done correctly, for if things are not done in the right way, something
very bad can happen, and even a serpent could come and wrap itself
around the ‘lamenter’.
