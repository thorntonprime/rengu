From this divine eminence we see the lowness and insignificance of
creatures. We feel an inkling of the perfection and stability of eternity,
for there is neither time nor space, neither before nor after, but everything
present in one new, fresh-springing now where millenniums last no longer
than the twinkling of an eye. And we win participation in the manifold
delights of the heavenly host. So great the joy of Mary Queen in heaven,
that having but a thousandth part of it, each member of the heavenly company
would taste far more than ever they have earned. There every spirit rejoices
in the joy of every other, relishing it each in his degree. Every celestial
habitant is, knows and loves in God, in his own self and in every other
spirit whether soul or angel. And the distinctive consciousness of one
God in three Persons and the Three one God gives such ineffable, amazing
satisfaction that all their passionate longing is fulfilled. And just what
they are full of they crave unceasingly, and what they crave is all their
own in new, fresh-springing joyful ecstasy, theirs to enjoy in all security
from everlasting unto everlasting.
