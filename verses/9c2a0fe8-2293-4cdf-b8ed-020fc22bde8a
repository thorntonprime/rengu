The essences of our souls can never cease to be, because they never began to
be; and nothing can live eternally, but that which hath lived from all eternity
Thou (O man) begannest as time began, but as time was in eternity before it
became days and years, so thou wast in God before thou wast brought into the
creation; and as time is neither a part of eternity, nor broken off from it,
yet come out of it; so thou art not a part of God nor broken off from Him, yet
born out of Him.
