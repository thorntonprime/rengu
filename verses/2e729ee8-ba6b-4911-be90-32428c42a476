Our prayer is a heart search, It is a reminder to ourselves that we are
helpless without His support, No effort is complete without prayer --
without a definite recognition that the best human endeavour is of no
effect if it has not God's blessing behind, Prayer is a call to humility,
It is a call to self-purification, to inward search.
