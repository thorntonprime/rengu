Who lifts himself too high can't hold a stance.
Who takes too giant a stride can't make advance.
Who gives himself the credit eclipses others finding merit.
Who prides himself on end soon finds himself without a friend.
In every instance such as these
the voyager on the Way can see
excess baggage and goods none need.

What's not in nature's economy,
abandon for integrity.
