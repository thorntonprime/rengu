Title: Bearing Witness to the Resurrection
---
A priest bears witness to the Resurrection by holding in his hands the Risen
Christ -- high over his head for all the people to see. And none of us see,
except by faith. Faith itself is the light of the Resurrection, our sharing
of the Resurrection. It is the effect of the Resurrection in our souls. By
it we are buried and rise from the dead in Christ.

Gone are the days when “mysticism" was for me a matter of eager and
speculative interest. Now, because it is my life, it is a torment to think
about. Like being in the pangs of childbirth and reading an essay on mother
love written by a spinster.

In choir I am happier than I have ever been there, extremely poor and helpless,
often strained, hardly able to hold myself in place. “Expecting every moment
to be my last.” Sometimes it is a great relief to be distracted. There is
a “presence” of God that is like an iron curtain between the mind and God.

But when I am at my toolshed hermitage, Saint Anne’s, I am always happy
and at peace no matter what happens. For here there is no need for anyone
but God -- no need of“mysticism.“

A fly buzzes on the windowpane!
