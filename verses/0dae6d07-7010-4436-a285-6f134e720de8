Title: Opposition
---
To reduce someone's influence, first expand it;
To reduce someone's force, first increase it;
To overthrow someone, first exalt them;
To take from someone, first give to them.

This is the subtlety by which the weak overcome the strongï¼š
Fish should not leave their depths,
And swords should not leave their scabbards.
