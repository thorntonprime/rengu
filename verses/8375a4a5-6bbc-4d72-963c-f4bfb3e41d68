Hell is even an enemy of the devil, for he is a strange guest therein,
viz. a perjured fiend cast out of heaven： he will be lord in that
wherein he was not created; the whole creation accuses him for a false
perjured apostate spirit, which is departed from his order; yea even
the nature in the wrath is his enemy though he be of the same
property; yet he is a stranger, and will be lord, though he has lost
his kingdom, and is only an inmate in the wrath of God; he that was
too rich, is now become too poor; he had all when he stood in
humility, and now he has nothing, and is moreover captivated in the
gulf： this is his shame, that he is a king, and yet has fooled away
his kingdom in pride; the royal creature remains, but the dominion is
taken away; of a king he is become an executioner; what God’s anger
apprehends, there he is a judge, viz. an officer of God’s anger, yet
he must do what his Lord and Master wills.
