The dragon is thy sensual soul： how is it dead? It is (only) frozen
by grief and lack of means.

If it obtain the means of Pharaoh, by whose command the water of the
river would flow.

Then it will begin to act like Pharaoh and will waylay a hundred (such
as) Moses and Aaron.

That dragon, under stress of poverty, is a little worm, (but) a gnat
is made a falcon by power and riches.

Keep the dragon in the snow of separation; beware, do not carry it
into the sun of Trâq.

So long as that dragon of thine remains frozen, (well and good); thou
art a mouthful for it. when it gains release.

Mortify it and become safe from (spiritual) death; have no mercy： it
is not one of them that deserve favours：

For (when) the heat of the sun of lust strikes upon it, that vile bat
of thine flaps its wings.

Lead it manfully to the spiritual warfare and battle： God will reward
thee with access (to Him). ...

Dost thou hope, without using violence, to keep it bound in quiet and
faithfulness?

How should this wish be fulfilled for any worthless one? It needs a
Moses to kill the dragon.
