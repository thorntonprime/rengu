A lord asked Takuan, a Zen Teacher, to suggest how he might pass
the time. He felt his days very long attending his office and
sitting stiffly to receive the homage of others.

Takuan wrote eight Chinese characters and gave them to the manï¼š

        Not twice this day
        Inch time foot gem.

        This day will not come again.
        Each minute is worth a priceless gem.
