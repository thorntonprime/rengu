A man with good character is gentle, humble and free of material desires. A
man with bad character is harsh, proud, and enslaved by greed. Gentleness
indicates greater strength than harshness. Humility is more admirable than
insolence. Freedom is always preferred to slavery.

Itâ€™s obvious. A man with good character has a better life.
