Title: Your Greatest Power
---
The things that you keep silently telling yourself are your most important
conversations. Whatever you habitually dwell on in your mind, you will become,
express, or experience. Your subconscious mind will be your best friend or
your worst enemy. Everything depends on the way you train it and the use
you make of it ... your freedom to think, choose, reason, and decide for
yourself. It shapes your destiny and determines the attraction and repulsion
in your life. Guard its portals well. It is your hope of heaven.
