Speech and silence are one! There is no distinction between them. ... Thus,
the sound of the Tathâgata’s voice is everlasting, nor can there be any
such reality as the time before he began to preach or the time after he
finished preaching. The preaching of the Tathâgata is identical with the
Dharma he taught.
