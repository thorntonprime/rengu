Title: Just before Dawn
Description: August 26
---
The best time to look for treasure starts late at night.
The sediment then settles in our sphere, freed from all the day’s hard wants.
One can get a clearer shot at God moving in the sky forest, just before dawn.
And is there ever a minute, my dear, when you are not hunting Love?
