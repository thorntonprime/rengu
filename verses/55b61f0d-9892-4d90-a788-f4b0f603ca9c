The more grievous a man's sins seem to him, the readier God is to forgive
them, to enter the soul and drive them out; for everyone is most diligent
in getting rid of what is most disagreeable to him. The more in number a
man's sins are, the greater they are, the more immeasurably glad God is
to forgive them. The more they irk him, the quicker he is about it. The
sooner divine repentance reaches up to God, the sooner the sins are
swallowed up in the abyss of Godâ€”as quickly as I can shut my eyes. They
are annihilated as if they had never happened, if only the repentance be
whole.
