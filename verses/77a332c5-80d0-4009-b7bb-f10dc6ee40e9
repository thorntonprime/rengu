\"Then I played it with the harmony of yin and yang, lit it with the
shining of sun and moon; its notes I was able to make long or short,
yielding or strong, modulating about a single unity, but bowing before
no rule or constancy. In the valley they filled the valley; in the void
they filled the void; plugging up the crevices, holding back the
spirit, accepting things on their own terms. Its notes were clear and
radiant, its fame high and bright. Therefore the ghosts and spirits
kept to their darkness and the sun, moon, stars, and constellations
marched in their orbits. I made it stop where there is an end to
things, made it flow where there is no stopping. You try to fathom it
but can't understand, try to gaze at it but can't see, try to overtake
it but can't catch up. You stand dazed before the four-directioned
emptiness of the Way, or lean on your desk and moan. Your eyes fail
before you can see, your strength knuckles under before you can catch
up. It was nothing I could do anything about. Your body melted into
the empty void, and this brought you to an idle freedom. It was this
idle freedom that made you feel weary.
