Title: For the Sake of All
---
In Your first everlasting
glimpse, before time

and space ever were,
You saw everything

in a single moment,
and in that look

gathered all that
was and is and

is to be -- even me,
freeing me

to will as You will
for the sake of

love, and to love
as You love

for the sake of all.
