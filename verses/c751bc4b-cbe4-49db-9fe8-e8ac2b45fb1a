Title: Just the Way I Would
Description: August 25
---
The dreams we share of freedom.
The dreams we share of love.
There is such a unison in our every movement, in our every desire;
we are so alike that I cannot tell the difference anymore between us.
I could walk into any house and feel at home,
because you have arranged everything just the way I would.
