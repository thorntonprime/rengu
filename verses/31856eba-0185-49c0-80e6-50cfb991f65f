The ruler precedes, the minister follows; the father precedes, the son
follows; the older brother precedes, the younger brother follows; the
senior precedes, the junior follows; the man precedes, the woman
follows; the husband precedes, the wife follows. Honor and lowliness,
precedence and following are part of the workings of Heaven and earth,
and from them the sage draws his model.
