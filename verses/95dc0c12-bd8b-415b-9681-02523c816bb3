    Title: I and Thou
By: Martin Buber

You know always in your heart that you need God more than everything; but
do you not know that God needs you -- in the fullness of His eternity needs
you? How would man be, how would you be, if God did not need him, did not
need you? You need God, in order to be -- and God needs you, for the very
meaning of your life. In instruction and in poems men are at pains to say
more, and they say too much-what turgid and presumptuous talk that is about
the â€œGod who becomes"; but we know unshakably in our hearts that there is
a becoming of the God that is. The world is not divine sport, it is divine
destiny. There is divine meaning in the life of the world, of man, of human
persons, of you and of me.
