All that I can offer to Jesus, is the prayer that His Holy Will be
accomplished. I find myself so indifferent, so foreign to everything, that I
dare compare myself to a child sleeping on the Divine Heart. From the day that
I abandoned myself to Him, in asking that He occupy Himself with my whole
person, I have enjoyed an enviable peace and felt a constant joy.
