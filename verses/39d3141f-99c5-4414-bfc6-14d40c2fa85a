Title: Let It Be, Leave It Alone
---
Big Concealment said, "If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven
and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no
fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the
birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees,
misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men
who `govern'!"
