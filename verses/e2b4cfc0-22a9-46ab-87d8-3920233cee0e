Title: Rediscovering Jesus
---
Today, in a moment of trial, I rediscovered Jesus, or perhaps discovered Him
for the first time. But then, in a monastery you are always rediscovering
Jesus tor the first time.

His eyes, which are the eyes of Truth, are fixed upon my heart. Where His
glance falls, there is peaceï¼š for the light of His Face, which is the Truth,
produces truth wherever it shines. His eyes are always on us in choir and
everywhere and in all times. No grace comes to us from heaven except He
looks upon our hearts.

The grace of this gaze of Christ upon my heart transfigured this day like a
miracle. It seems to me that I have discovered a freedom that I never knew
before in my life and with this freedom a recollection that is no impediment
to moderate action. I have felt that the Spirit of God was upon me, and after
dinner, walking along the road beyond the orchard by myself under a cobalt
blue sky (in which the moon was already visible), I thought that, if I only
turned my head a little, I would see a tremendous host of angels in silver
armor advancing behind me through the sky, coming at last to sweep the whole
world clean. I did not have to mortify this fantasy as it did not arouse my
emotions but carried me along on a vivid ocean of peace. And the whole world
and the whole sky was filled with wonderful music, as it has often been for
me in these days. But sitting alone in the attic of the garden house and
looking at the stream shining in the bare willows and at the distant hills,
I think I have never been so near to Adams, my father's, Eden. Our Eden is
the Heart of Christ.
