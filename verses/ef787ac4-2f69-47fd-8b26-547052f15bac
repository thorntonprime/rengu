If we must use curve and plumb line, compass and square to make
something right, this means cutting away its inborn nature; if we must
use cords and knots, glue and lacquer to make something firm, this
means violating its natural Virtue. So the crouchings and bendings of
rites and music, the smiles and beaming looks of benevolence and
righteousness, which are intended to comfort the hearts of the world,
in fact destroy their constant naturalness.
