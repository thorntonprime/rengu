Title: Sleep Talk
---
\“What is love? For the sincere it requires no tears, no laughter.
Kick and crush love’s gourd.
Bury tears and laughter in the dust.
Pound reason and sentiment into powder.
Ascend the height of emptiness and dance dizzily, sing madly.
Ply your lover and Satan alike with wine.
Become an idiot, a lunatic, a dead man living.”

“You mean, love won’t let go, even if it means your death?
Then, hitch a cart to its tail.
Ride it around as you like; rest if you want; sleep if you will;
  live or die as you please."

“It’s ludicrous to stake yourself to love and then cry over it.
No one goes around with ‘nim’ branded on their forehead.
Love is free, virtue is fluid, marriage is a thicket of rites.”

All of this I cried loudly in my sleep.
My lover’s smile is like starlight, unvanquished by the rays of blackness.
Before I knew it, the tears that racked my dreams had wet my pillow.
Forgive me, my love.
It’s the fault of dreaming, but if you want to punish don’t punish dreams.
