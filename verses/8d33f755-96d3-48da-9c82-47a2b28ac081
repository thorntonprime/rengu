Sunlight, fill this house again,
delighting friends, blinding enemies.
Come from behind the mountain.
Turn all stones red.
Ripen back the grapes gone sour.
Dress the fields, the garden, and the pasture,
with strands of every color.
Cure the lovers.
Let your face be openly here,
not covered with cloud.
Clarify what is
with direct, unfiltered, light.
