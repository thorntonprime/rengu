Those who have passed into the unitive life have attained unto a Being
transcending all that can be apprehended by sight or insight. ... But the
soul remains contemplating that Supreme Beauty and Holiness and contemplating
itself in the beauty which it has acquired by attaining to the Divine Presence,
and for such a one, things seen are blotted out, but not the seeing souls. But
some pass beyond this and they are the Elect of the Elect, who are consumed
by the glory of His exalted Countenance, and the greatness of the Divine
Majesty overwhelms them and they are annihilated and they themselves are
no more. They no longer contemplate themselves, and there remains only the
One, the Real, and the meaning of His Word; ‘All things perish save His
Countenance’ is known by experience.
