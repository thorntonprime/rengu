Above all things beware of taking this desire of repentance to be the
effect of thy own natural sense and reason, for in so doing thou
losest the key of all the heavenly treasure that is in thee, thou
shuttest the door against God, turnest away from Him, and thy
repentance (if thou hast any) will be only a vain, unprofitable work
of thy own hands, that will do thee no more good than a well that is
without water. ... When, therefore, the first spark of a desire after
God arises in thy soul, cherish it with all thy care, give all thy
heart into it, it is nothing less than a touch of the divine loadstone
that is to draw thee out of the vanity of time into the riches of
eternity. Get up, therefore, and follow it as gladly as the Wise Men
of the East followed the star from Heaven that appeared to them. It
will do for thee as the star did for themï¼š it will lead thee to the
birth of Jesus, not in a stable at Bethlehem in Judea, but to the
birth of Jesus in the dark centre of thy own fallen soul.
