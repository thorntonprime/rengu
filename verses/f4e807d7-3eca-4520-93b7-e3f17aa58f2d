Title: Fog
Description: April 14
---
As fog rising off the sea
covers the sea,

so it is noble work to build
coherent philosophical discourses,

but they block the sun of truth.
See God's qualities as an ocean

and this world as foam
on the purity of that ocean.

Here is the mystery.
This intricate, astonishing world
is proof of God's existence,
even as it covers the beauty.

One flake from the wall of a goldmine
does not give much idea
what it is like

when the sun shines in
and turns the air
and the workers golden.
