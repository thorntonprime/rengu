  - Invocation=The Dispeller of Sin
By: Sri Ramakrishna
---
All the sins of the body fly away if one chants the name of God and sings
His glories. The birds of sin dwell in the tree of the body. Singing the
name of God is like clapping your hands. As, at a clap of the hands, the
birds in the tree fly away, so do our sins disappear at the chanting of
Godâ€™s name and glories.
