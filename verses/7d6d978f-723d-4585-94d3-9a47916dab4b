Illusion all --
Yet where for us the real
Unless what seems?
These cloud-capped towers
More durable than brass
Our dreams.

Say I must recognize
I but imagined love
Where no love was,
Say all is a dream
In whose brief span
Childhood, womanhood, the grave
Where my love lies：
That dream is all I am.

Cast not before swine --
The rational animal
Oysters’ soft aphrodisiac flesh prefers：
Who values then a pearl
At so great price
As to sell all
To purchase one?
