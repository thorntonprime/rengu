The soul must begin by warring against itself, and stirring up within
itself a mighty feud; and the one part of the soul must win victory
over the others, which are more in number. It is a feud of one against
two, the one part struggling to mount upward, and the two dragging it
down; and there is much strife and fighting between them. And it makes
no small difference whether the one side or the other wins; for the
one part strives towards the Good, the others make their home among
evils; the one yearns for freedom, the others are content with
slavery. And if the two parts are vanquished, they stay quiet in
themselves, and submissive to the ruling part; but if the one part is
defeated, it is carried off as a captive by the two, and the life it
lives on earth is a life of penal torment. Such is the contest about
the journey to the world above. You must begin, my son, by winning
victory in this contest, and then, having won, mount upward.
