He who loves me is made pure; his heart melts in joy. He rises to
transcendental consciousness by the rousing of his higher emotional nature.
Tears of joy flow from his eyes; his hair stands on end; his heart melts in
love. The bliss in that state is so intense that forgetful of himself and his
surroundings he sometimes weeps profusely, or laughs, or sings, or dances; such
a devotee is a purifying influence upon the whole universe.
