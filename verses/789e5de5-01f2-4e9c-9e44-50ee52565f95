Life begins for anyone when that individual refuses to be a victim of
any delimiting experienceï¼š disease, accident, poverty, family pressure,
marriage dilemma, neglect. Whatever the curse, if you will not take it,
or accept the role fate seems to offer, you can never become a mental
cripple and nothing can hold you back.
