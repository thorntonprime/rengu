If any man then has an incorporeal eye, let him go forth from the body to
behold the Beautiful, let him fly up and float aloft, not seeking to see shape
or colour, but rather that by which these things are made, that which is quiet
and calm, stable and changeless, ...  that which, being one, is yet all
things, which issues from itself and is contained in itself, that which is
like nothing but itself.
