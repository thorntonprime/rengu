Elijah was told, "Go out and stand on the mountain before God, for
God is about to pass by."

First, there was a great wind, so strong that it split mountains and broke
rocks into tiny pieces, but God was not in the wind.

Next there was a terrible earthquake, but God was not in the earthquake.

Following was a fire, but God was not in the fire.

Finally, once wind and earth and fire had passed there was the sound of
complete silence. When Elijah heard it, he knew he was in the presence of God.
