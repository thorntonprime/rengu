Title: The Turning Of Heaven
---
\"Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun ceded it to Yu. Yu wore himself
out over it, and T'ang even resorted to war. King Wen obeyed Chou and
did not dare to rebel; but his son King Wu turned against Chou and
refused to remain loyal. Therefore I say that they were not the same."
