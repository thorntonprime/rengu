Divining gave me this hidden dwelling placeï¼š
T'ien-t'ai, it said, and no more.
Gibbons shriek; the mist in the ravine is freezing.
Mountain colors, run straight up to my grass gate.
I've dressed a pine in leaves. That's my fancy hall.
I've cleaned out the pool and channeled the spring.
Sweet, to let the world go.
Ferns, I'll harvest, to live out the years left.
