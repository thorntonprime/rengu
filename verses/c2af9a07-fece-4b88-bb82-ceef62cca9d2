Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is
cramped and busy. Great words are clear and limpid; little words are
shrill and quarrelsome. In sleep, men's spirits go visiting; in waking
hours, their bodies hustle. With everything they meet they become
entangled. Day after day they use their minds in strife, sometimes
grandiose, sometimes sly, sometimes petty. Their little fears are mean
and trembly; their great fears are stunned and overwhelming. They bound
off like an arrow or a crossbow pellet, certain that they are the
arbiters of right and wrong. They cling to their position as though
they had sworn before the gods, sure that they are holding on to
victory. They fade like fall and winter - such is the way they dwindle
day by day. They drown in what they do - you cannot make them turn
back. They grow dark, as though sealed with seals - such are the
excesses of their old age. And when their minds draw near to death,
nothing can restore them to the light.
