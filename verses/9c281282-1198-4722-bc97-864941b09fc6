Title: On Our Best Days
---
On our best days and our worst, in times both
clever and confused, our life is finally summed

in thisï¼š we are made to love without reason,
to breathe in the wide open plain of wonder,

to ponder without asking why,

because in God there is no why
to be found, no reason to be known

beyond the flame of ever whyless love
