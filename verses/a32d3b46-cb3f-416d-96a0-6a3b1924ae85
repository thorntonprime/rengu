Title: The Heart's Vision
Description: An ode to St. Thomas
---
No one says it like you do,
Thomas --
    the kingdom of God forever.
Not that. No.
It is the simple
    understanding,
the eternal vision of
    affected hearts
known to the Holy One of
    infinite time and space
who speaks and worlds
    are made,
not like kingdoms of earth
    buildings and gold
but love that sees all and
    everywhere, that
    lasts now, as ever,
    as was,
    and is.
