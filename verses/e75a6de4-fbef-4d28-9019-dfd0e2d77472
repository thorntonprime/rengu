I seek in my mind for the days of my youth,
when I rode to the hunt at Ping-ling.
Imperial envoy was a post far beneath me,
nor would I have wanted an Immortal's fame!
From a winged steed, my white stallion,
I loosed falcons upon hares ...
Unconscious, I was, as the now stooped to conquer.
Yet who in all the world, besides myself,
could judge me one worth pity!
