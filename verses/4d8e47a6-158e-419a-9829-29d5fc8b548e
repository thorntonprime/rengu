Title: Random Thoughts on the Love of God
---
Creatures speak in sounds.
The word of God is silence.
The secret word of God's love
can be nothing but silence.
Christ is the silence of God.
There is no tree like the cross.
No harmony like the silence of God.
The Pythagoreans knew this harmony
in the endless silence
that surrounds the stars.
Necessity, here below,
is the resonance of God's silence.

Our soul makes constant noise,
but it has a silent place we never hear.
When the silence of God enters us,
pierces our soul and joins its silent secret place,
then God is our treasure and our heart.
And space opens before us
like a fruit that breaks in two.
Then we see the universe
from a point beyond space.
