Title: Art of Life
---
The sound of an unconscious sigh turns into the spring wind;
dewy flowers bloom in the mirror that reflects my haggard face.
Around me, my only consolation is the breath of wind.
Unending tears turn in'to crystal that illumines the sanctuary
 of pure sorrow.
If not for these crystal tears, I’d have nothing to treasure in this world.

Breath of wind, crystal tears：
these are the harvest of my mourning.
Aching sorrow turns into strength and fire,
and like a young lamb, breathes into life.
The sighs and tears my lover gives me are the beautiful art of life.
