The one religion is beyond all speech. Imperfect men put it into such
language as they can command, and their words are interpreted by other
men equally imperfect. Whose interpretation is to be held to be the right
one? Everybody is right from his own standpoint, but it is not impossible
that everybody is wrong. Hence the necessity of tolerance, which does not
mean indifference to one's own faith, but a more intelligent and purer
love for it.
