Han Shan has so many strange, well-hidden sights,
Every climber climbs a little timidly ...
Moon shines in the dripping water;
wind brings the very grass alive.
Freezing trees flower with snow,
dead, bare trees leafed out in cloud.
Gored by cold rain, the liveliest soul turns away.
Unless it stays sunny, you'll never get through.
