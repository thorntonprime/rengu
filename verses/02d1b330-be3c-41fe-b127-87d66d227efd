The flow of a stream is sluggish if the source is shallow. A water-wheel
won’t turn in it. A tall building won’t last if the foundation is shaky.
Walls crack and soon the floors collapse. Depth and firmness are
indispensable for good work and endurance. The saints knew this. That’s why
they rooted themselves deep in the Dharma. They became towers of goodness
that nothing could topple. Their enlightenment was a beacon that guided and
inspired others for generations.

Don’t be content to study the Dharma, to memorize its surface. Plunge into
it. Go as deeply as you can.
