When Hui Tzu was prime minister of Liang, Chuang Tzu set off to visit
him. Someone said to Hui Tzu, "Chuang Tzu is coming because he wants to
replace you as prime minister!" With this Hui Tzu was filled with alarm
and searched all over the state for three days and three nights trying
to find Chuang Tzu. Chuang Tzu then came to see him and said, "In the
south there is a bird called the Yuan-ch'u - I wonder if you've ever
heard of it? The Yuan-ch'u rises up from the South Sea and flies to the
North Sea, and it will rest on nothing but the Wu-t'ung tree, eat
nothing but the fruit of the Lien, and drink only from springs of sweet
water. Once there was an owl who had gotten hold of a half-rotten old
rat, and as the Yuan-ch'u passed by, it raised its head, looked up at
the Yuan-ch'u, and said, 'Shoo!' Now that you have this Liang state of
yours, are you trying to shoo me?"
