A garden-may its rose be in flower to Resurrection!
An idol-may the two worlds be scattered o'er his beauty!
The prince of the fair goes proudly forth to the chase
at morning;
May our hearts fall a prey to the arrow of his glance!
From his eye what messages are passing continually to mine!
May my eyes be gladdened and filled,with intoxication
by his message!
I broke an ascetic's door. with a prayer he banned me,
Saying,, Go, may all thy life be without peace. I
No peace, no heart is left me, on account of his prayer,
by the Friend!
Who thirsts for our blood-may God befriend him!
My body is like the moon which is melting for love,
My heart like Zuhra's lute-may its strings be broken
Look not on the moon's waning nor on Zuhra's broken
state;
Behold the sweetness of his affliction-may it wax a
Thousand fold!
What a bride is in the soul! By the reflection of her face
May the world be freshened and coloured like the hands
of the newly-married!
Look not on the fleshly cheek which corrupts and decays;
Look on the spiritual cheek-may it be sweet and agreeable!
The dark body resembles a raven, and the body's world winter;
Oh, in spite of these two unpleasants may there be
eternal spring!
For these two unpleasants subsist by the four elements
May the subsistence of thy servants depend on something
other than these four.
