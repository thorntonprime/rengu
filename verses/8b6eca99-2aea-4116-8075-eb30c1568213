Title: My Place in the Scheme of Things
---
Everything about this hermitage fills me with joy. There are lots of things
that could have been far more perfect one way or the other -- ascetically
and “domestically.” But it is the place God has given me after so much
prayer and longing -- but without my deserving it--- and it is a delight. I
can imagine no other joy on earth than to have a hermitage and to be at peace
in it, to live in silence, to think and write, to listen to the wind and to
all the voices of the wood, to live in the shadow of the big cedar cross,
to prepare for my death and my exodus to the heavenly country, to love
my brothers and all people, and to pray for the whole world and for peace
and good sense among men. So it is “my place” in the scheme of things,
and that is sufficient!

Reading some studies on St. Leonard of Port Maurice and his retirement
house (Ritiro) and herrnitage of the Incontro. How clearly Vatican II has
brought into question all the attitudes that he and his companions took
completely for granted： the dramatic barefoot procession from Florence
to the Incontro in the snow -- the daily half-hour self-flagellation in
common -- etc. This used to be admired, if prudently avoided, by all in
the Church. Depth psychology, etc., have made these things forever
questionable -- they belong to another age. And yet there has to be hardness
and rigor in the solitary life. The hardness is there by itself. The cold,
the solitude, the labor, the need for poverty to keep everything simple and
manageable, the need for the discipline of long meditation in silence.
