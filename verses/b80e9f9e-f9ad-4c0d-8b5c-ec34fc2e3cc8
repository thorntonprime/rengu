Yesterday I saw trees on the river banks.
Battered! It was hard to believe.
Two or three trunks like poles,
chopped by axes, skinned by blades ...
Frost had yellowed, then stripped, their leaves.
Even the roots were battered in the flow ...
Wherever there's life
                      things like this happen.
Shall I blame the power of Heaven?
Shall I blame the power of Earth?
