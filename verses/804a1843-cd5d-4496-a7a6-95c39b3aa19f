Saith the soul in the Book of Love, ‘No one is God to me and I am soul to
none.' By ‘no one is God to me’ she means merely that no entity, nothing
nameable, is her God. Again the words. ‘I am soul to none’ mean that she is so
void of self she has not got it in her to be aught to anyone. This is the state
in which the soul should be： in utter destitution. The soul cries in the Book
of Love, ‘He is mine and I am his.’ It were better she had said, ‘He is not
mine nor am I his.’ for God who is in all is therein all his own. She can lay
claim to naught： she has lost every whit whereto any wight could in anywise be
aught or she withal be aught to any wight. No one is her God and she is no
one’s soul.
