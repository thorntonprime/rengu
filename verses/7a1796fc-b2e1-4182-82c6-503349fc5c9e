All nature and all that is natural in the creature is in itself nothing else
but darkness, whether it be in soul or body, in Heaven or on earth. ... If you
ask, why nature must be darkness, it is because nature is not God and therefore
can have no light as it is nature. For God and light are as inseparable, as God
and unity are inseparable. Everything therefore that is not God, is and can be
nothing else in itself but darkness, and can do nothing but in and under and
according to the nature and powers of darkness.
