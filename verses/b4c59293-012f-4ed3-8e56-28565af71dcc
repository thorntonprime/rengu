It is of course nothing new that you gain. God is already within you,
but you had forgotten Him and so temporarily lost Him. When any external
matter enters your eye, you feel terrible irritation. When it is removed,
your pain is relieved and you feel as if you have gained something new. In
fact, you did not gain anything new. You only got back to the normal state
you had lost temporarily.
