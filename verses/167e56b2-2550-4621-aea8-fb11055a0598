Behold, all that is contrary to the True Light belongeth unto the
False. ... In so far as this Light imagineth itself to be God and
taketh His attributes unto itself, it is Lucifer, the Evil Spirit; but
in so far as it setteth at nought the life of Christ, and other things
belonging to the True Light, which have been taught and fulfilled by
Christ, it is Antichrist, for it teacheth contrary to Christ.
