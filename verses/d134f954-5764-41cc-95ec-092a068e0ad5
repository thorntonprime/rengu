The soul is like the eye; when resting upon that on which truth and
being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with
intelligenceï¼š but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is
first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
intelligence.
