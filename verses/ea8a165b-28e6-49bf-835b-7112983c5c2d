  - Self-Reliance
---
The man who is self-reliant, always says： “No one can realize my
possibilities for me, but me; no one can make me good or evil but myself.”
He works out his own salvation, financially, socially, mentally, physically,
and morally. Life is an individual problem that man must solve for himself.
