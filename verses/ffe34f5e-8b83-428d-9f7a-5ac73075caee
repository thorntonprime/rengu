Title: My Song
---
My song has no fixed rhythm,
so it has nothing in common with normal tunes.
This doesn’t grieve me,
because my song should be different.

Melody smooths out the defect of songs.
Melody grinds up unnatural songs with human delusions.
To set genuine song to music dishonors its nature.
Music blemishes my song, just as making up your face disfigures it.

My song makes the god of love cry.
My song squeezes youth into rare, pure water.
My song enters your ear and becomes heaven’s music;
It enters your dream and becomes tears.

I know you hear my song across the distant fields and mountains.
When its pitch stumbles and falls silent,
my song enters your sad, quiet thoughts and vanishes.
When I think of you listening to my song,
my heart pounds with exhilaration and draws out the notes of silence.
