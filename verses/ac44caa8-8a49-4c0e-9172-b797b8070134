Title: Heavenliness in the Nature of Things
---
Real spring weather -- these are the precise days when everything
changes. All the trees are fast beginning to be in leaf, and the first green
freshness of a new summer is all over the hills. Irreplaceable purity of
these days chosen by God as His sign!

Mixture of" heavenliness and anguish. Seeing “heavenliness” suddenly,
for instance, in the pure white of mature dogwood blossoms against the dark
evergreens in the cloudy garden. “Heavenliness” too of the song of the
unknown bird that is perhaps here only for these days, passing through,
a lovely, deep, simple song. Seized by this “heavenliness” as ifl were
a child -- a child’s mind I have never done anything to deserve to have
and which is my own part in the heavenly spring. Not of this world, or of
my making. Born partly of physical anguish (which is really not there,
though. It goes quickly). Sense that the “heavenliness” is the real
nature of things, not their nature, but the fact they are a gift oflove
and of freedom.
