People think that if they posses worldly knowledge they know everything.
But that’s not correct. Even when subjects are mastered there’s always room
for error. And if the finest archers can miss their targets occasionally,
what about the mediocre ones? When we know the Dharma, we have all the
information we need. No matter what the other facts we acquire
additionally, our storehouse of knowledge, though very deep and wide, is
already full.
