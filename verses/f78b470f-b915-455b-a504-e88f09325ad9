No pronouncement of a prophet is ever his own; he is an interpreter prompted by
Another in all his utterances, when knowing not what he does, he is filled with
inspiration, as the reason withdraws and surrenders the citadel of the soul to
a new visitor and tenant, the Divine Spirit which plays upon the vocal organism
and raises sounds from it, which clearly express its prophetic message.
