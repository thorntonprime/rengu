Title: Deliberation
Description: September 21-22
---
A friend remarks to the prophet, Why is it
I always make bad business deals?
It's like a spell. I become distracted
by business talk and get led into wrong decisions.

Muhammad replies, Stipulate with every transaction
that you need three days to make sure.

Deliberation is one of the qualities of God.
Throw a dog a bit of something.
He sniffs to see if he wants it.

Be that careful. Sniff with your wisdom-nose.
Get clear. Then decide.

The universe came into being gradually
over six days. God could have just commandedï¼š BE.

Little by little a person reaches forty and fifty
and sixty and feels more complete.

God could have thrown full-blown prophets
flying through the cosmos in an instant.

Jesus said one word, and a dead man sat up,
but creation usually unfolds like calm breakers.

Constant slow movement teaches us
to keep working like a small creek
that stays clear, that does not stagnate,
but finds a way through numerous
details, deliberately.

Deliberation is born of joy
like a bird from an egg.

Birds do not resemble eggs.
Think how different the hatching out is.

A white leathery snake egg, a sparrow's egg,
a quince seed, an apple seed.
Very different things look similar at one stage.

These leaves, our bodily personalities,
seem identical, but the globe
of soul fruit we make,
each is elaborately
unique.
