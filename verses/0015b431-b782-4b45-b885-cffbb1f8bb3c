The truth is that a man succeeds to a great extent because of tendencies
inherited from his previous births. People think he has attained the goal
all of a sudden. A man drank a glass of wine in the morning. It made him
completely drunk. He began to behave improperly. People were amazed to see
that he could be so drunk after one glass. But another man said, ‘Why,
he has been drinking all night.’
