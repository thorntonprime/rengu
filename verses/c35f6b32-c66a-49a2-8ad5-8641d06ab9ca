Title: The Root of the Rose
Description: July 13
---
In this cup I am drinking from, I can see the Face behind every face,
A well now, where creation has been drawn, I am. How can a jug being carried
 on the top of my head contain everything?
A galaxy can appear in the reflection of a small clear pool.
Right where the moon may appear smiling at you from a body of still water ...
 a fish might leap out
and swallow that orb whole, and who is to say, maybe then lay it at your feet?
Within an armâ€™s reach is all I desire, so I am never in want.
The root of the Rose I have become, from loving the way I did.
