Heaviness is the root of lightness：
The still is ruler of the turbulent.
So the nobleman travels all day
Without losing sight of the heavy wagons.
When he’s secure behind walls and towers,
Then he’s at rest and without trouble.
How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots,
Treat the people lightly in his thoughts?
In lightness the root is lost：
In turbulence the ruler is lost.
