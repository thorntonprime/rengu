Title: Life
---
Anchor and rudder lost, the small boat of life drifts on violent water.
A thread of hope from the dream of an undiscovered golden land
becomes a compass, a chart, a fair wind to sail the frightening sea
that beats against the sky on one end, against the earth on the other.

My love, hold tight this small life I give you.
Press it close, and in that sacred land the splinters of this sacrificed life
will become the rarest of jewels, which Iâ€™ll fit together piece by piece
and hang upon you as an emblem of love.

My love, take my life, a small bird in an endless desert
without a single tree to perch upon, and hold it tight.
And then lift each crushed fragment of life to your lips.
