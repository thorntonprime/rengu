Let our artists be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the
beautiful and graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid
fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and beauty, the
effluence of fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving
breeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years
into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.
