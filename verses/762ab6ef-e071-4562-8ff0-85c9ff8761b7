How great the Way,
like a flooding river flowing left and right!
Holding nothing back, it gives to all in need
and makes no claim upon them.

All creatures return to it, yet it rules none：
how small it seems.
It rules none, yet all creatures return to it：
how great it seems.

By never seeking greatness,
greatness comes.
