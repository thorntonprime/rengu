“You deliver me from the gates of death that I might announce your
praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion” (Psalm 9).

Marvelous vision of the hills at 7：45 am, The same hills as always,
as in the afternoon, but now catching the light in a totally new way,
at once very earthly and very ethereal, with delicate cups of shadow
and dark ripples and crinkles where I had never seen them, and the whole
slightly veiled in mist so that it seemed to be a tropical shore, a newly
discovered continent, And a voice in me seemed to be crying, “Look! Look
For these are the discoveries, and it is for this that I am high on the
mast of my ship (have always been), and I know that we are on the right
