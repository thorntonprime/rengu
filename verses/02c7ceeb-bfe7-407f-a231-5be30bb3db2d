Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary： praise him in the firmament
  of his power.
Praise him for his mighty acts： praise him according to his excellent
  greatness.
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet： praise him with the psaltery and
  harp.
Praise him with the timbrel and dance： praise him with stringed instruments
  and organs.
Praise him upon the loud cymbals： praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord
