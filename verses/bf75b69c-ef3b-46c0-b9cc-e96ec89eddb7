Vast, vast the living waters, the Yellow River flows,
eastward always, ever unceasing ...
and long as you look, in time or space,
you'll never see it clear.
Every human lifetime has its end.
So, would you rise and ride the white clouds?
How are your wings to grow?
Only start while your bait's still black,
and dwelling or moving, strive.
