When God shall awaken himself upon the World, then shall it be known, that he
alone is the Eye, the Light, the Life of the World. ... When this Eternal
Spirit, in whose sleep, like painted forms in a dream, they (the things of
this world) vainly flutter about, awakeneth himself, he at once dissolveth
them into their own nothingness and despiseth them, as having never been
anything.
