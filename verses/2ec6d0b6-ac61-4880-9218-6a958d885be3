This country (Hoa-su-cheu) is west of Yen-tcheou, north of T’ai-tcheou, at
I don’t know how many myriads of stages from this country of Ts’i. One
can neither go there by boat nor carriage; only the flight of the soul
reaches there. In this country there is no leader; everything functions
spontaneously. The people have neither desires nor greed, but simply natural
instinct. No one there loves life, nor dreads death; each lives until his
term. No enmities and no hatreds. No gains and no losses. No interests and no
fears. Water does not drown them, fire does not burn them. No weapon can wound
them, no hand can injure them. They rise in the air as if going up stairs,
and they stretch out in the void as upon a bed. Clouds and fog do not hinder
their view, the noise of thunder does not affect their hearing, no beauty
or ugliness upsets their heart, no height or depth obstructs their course.
The flight of the soul carries them everywhere.
