Damascene says that the various planets produce in us various
temperaments, habits and dispositions. Consequently, the heavenly
bodies contribute indirectly to the goodness of our understanding.
Thus, even as physicians are able to judge of a man's intellect from
his bodily temperament, as a proximate disposition thereto, so too can
an astrologer, from the heavenly movements, as being a remote cause of
this disposition. In this sense we can approve of the saying of
Ptolemy： When Mercury is in one of Saturn’s regions at the time of a
man’s birth, and he is waxing, he bestows on him a quick intelligence
of the inner nature of things.
