Title: A Priest with the World as My Parish
---
Looking in the crucifix on the white wall of Saint Anne’s -- overwhelmed
it the realization that I am a priest, that it has been given to me to know
omething of what the Cross means, that St. Anne’s is it special part of my
priestly vocation： the silence, the woods, the sunlight, the shadows, the
picture of Jesus, Our Lady of Cobre, and the little angels in Fra Angelico's
paradise. Here I am a priest with all the world its my parish. Or is it
a temptation, the thought of this? Perhaps I do not need to remember the
apostolic fruitfulness of this silence. I need only to be nothing and to
wait for the revelation of Christ： to be in peace and poor and silent in
the world where the mystery of iniquity is also at work and where there is
also no other revelation. No, there is so much peace at St. Anne’s that it
is most certainly the heart of a great spiritual battle that is fought in
silence. I who sit here and pray and think and live -- I am nothing and do
not need to know what is going on. I need only to hope in Christ and hear
the big deep bell that now begins to ring and sends its holy sound to me
through the little cedars.

This is the continuation of my Mass. This is still my Eucharist, my day-long
thanksgiving, work, worship, my hoping tor the perfect revelation of Christ.
