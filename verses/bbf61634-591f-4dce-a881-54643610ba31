\"It is easy to keep from walking; the hard thing is to walk without
touching the ground. It is easy to cheat when you work for men, but
hard to cheat when you work for Heaven. You have heard of flying with
wings, but you have never heard of flying without wings. You have heard
of the knowledge that knows, but you have never heard of the knowledge
that does not know. Look into that closed room, the empty chamber where
brightness is born! Fortune and blessing gather where there is
stillness. But if you do not keep still - this is what is called
sitting but racing around.  Let your ears and eyes communicate with
what is inside, and put mind and knowledge on the outside. Then even
gods and spirits will come to dwell, not to speak of men! This is the
changing of the ten thousand things, the bond of Yu and Shun, the
constant practice of Fu Hsi and Chi Ch'u. How much more should it be a
rule for lesser men!"
