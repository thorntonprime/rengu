Commentary: This drowning is the inverse of that drowning in the ‘lower
  waters’ (of inferior psychic possibilities), already mentioned in the
  Introduction to Pilgrimage, where precisely the death in question brings
  dissolution and ruin.

(The self) is like a drop of water afraid of wind and earth; for by means of
  these twain it is made to pass away (and perish).
When it has leaped into the sea, which was its source, it is delivered from the
  heat of the sun and from wind and earth.
Its outward form has disappeared in the sea, but its essence is inviolate and
  permanent and goodly.
Hark, O drop, give thyself up without repenting, that in recompense for the
  drop thou mayst gain the ocean.
