It is a sure sign of this light (of grace) when of his own free will a
person turns from mortal things to the highest good. God namely. We
are in duty bound to love him for conferring on the soul such great
perfection. When she has reached her limit of endeavour then will as
such is free to leap over to that gnosis which is God himself. A
somersault which lands the soul at the summit of her power.
