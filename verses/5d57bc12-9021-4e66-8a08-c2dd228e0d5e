You can distinctly feel the shift of mind as it leaves its seat in the brain,
attempting to return to its original seat (yat√¢sthana); you realize that
it has left its former channels to enter into new ones. ... Its psychology
is transformed. You now have a wholly new brain, a new heart, and noble
sensations and feelings.
