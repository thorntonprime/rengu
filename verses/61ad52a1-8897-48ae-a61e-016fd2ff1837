If thou wert not to attain unto Him except upon the extinction of thy
wickedness and the effacement of thy claims, then wouldst thou never attain
unto Him; but should He wish to unite thee unto Him, then would He cover thy
qualities with His Qualities, and describe thee with His Description, and unite
thee unto Him with what is from Him to thee, not with what is from thee to Him.
