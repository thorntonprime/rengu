Whatever opinion is held concerning the vitality of capitalism itself,
whatever the life span predicted for it, it is bound to withstand the
onslaughts of its enemies and its own irrationality much longer than
essentially untenable export monopolism -- untenable even from the
capitalist point of View. Export monopolism may perish in revolution, or
it may be peacefully relinquished; this may happen soon, or it may take
some time and require desperate struggle; but one thing is certain -- it
will happen. This will immediately dispose of neither warlike instincts
nor structural elements and organizational forms oriented toward war --
and it is to their dispositions and domestic interests that, in my opinion,
much more weight must be given in every concrete case of imperialism than
to export monopolist interests, which fumish the financial “outpost
skirmishes” -- a most appropriate term -- in many ways. But such factors
will be politically overcome in time, no matter what they do to maintain
among the people a sense of constant danger of war, with the war machine
forever primed for action. And with them, imperialisms will wither and die.
