Title: Eloquent Petitions and Clever Complaints
---
I have seen You heal a hundred deep wounds with one glance from Your
spectacular eyes,

while Your hands beneath the table pour large bags of salt into the
heart-gashes of Your most loyal servants.

Dear world, I can offer an intelligent explanation for our spiritual
suff ering ... but I hope it really makes sense to no one here

and come morning you are again at God's door with ax and pickets,
eloquent petitions and very clever, loud complaints.

Think of suff ering as being washed. That is to say, Hafiz, you are
often completely soaked and dripping.

The only advantage I can see in this, in the Friend's long-range plan,
is that when the Beloved bursts into ecstatic flames

the whole world will not turn into a bright oil wick all at onceâ€”and
then divine ash, and thus ruin

His winter crop; which is most of us. I mean our big yield is probably
somewhere down the road, in the futures market.

Oh well.
