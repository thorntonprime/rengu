If a man has acquired faith, takes delight in contemplation of me, is
indifferent to work, and yet, though knowing their vanity, fails to give up
all desires -- let him with complete devotion continue to worship me with a
cheerful heart. Though he may find it necessary to satisfy his desires, which
he is unable for the time to give up, let him all the while ponder on the
emptiness of such gratification and know it to be fraught with evil
consequences.
