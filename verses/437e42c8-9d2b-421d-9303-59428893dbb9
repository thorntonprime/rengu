Those who would truly know and prepare the first Matter of the Philosopherâ€™s
Stone (the chief and principal mystery of this earth) must have a deep insight
into the nature of things, just as those who would know the Heavenly Stone
(i.e, the indissoluble, triune essence of the true and living God) must have a
profound spiritual insight into the things of heaven.
