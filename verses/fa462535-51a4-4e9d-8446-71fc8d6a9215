  This refers to a miracle of Muhammad at Mecca, where the moon was cloven
  in two. each half circumambulating the Ka'bah in opposite directions, to
  rejoin above the sacred House. This is analogous esoterically to the
  alchemical solve el coagula where a finite equilibrium is ruptured to be
  re-established on the principial plane.

Behold a continual ‘cleaving of the moon’ in our hearts.
