  Title: The Man of Many Qualities

\"How are you, Hachi? We heard you weren't well and we thought you might be
lonely, so we have come to keep you company tonight. Is there anything you
would like to eat? Just say the word, and we'll make it for you."

"That's very good of you. A bachelor is pretty helpless when he's ill
in bed. Please stay the night and enjoy yourselves."

"Righto, we will. If you want some medicine, or hot water, just tell us."

During the evening the visitors talked and drank sake, and as time went on
they lay down one after another and fell asleep. When the sick man awoke he
asked for a cup of tea or some hot water, but none of them could he bring
out of their stupor. He had to crawl out of bed himself, and then one of them
woke and said, "Hey, Hachi, what are you up to?" "Nothing," he said,
"I only want some tea," creeping towards the kettle. Then his friend said,
"I say, pour me a cup of tea, too, won't you, while you are about it?"
