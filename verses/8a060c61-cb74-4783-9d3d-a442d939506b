Title: Sleepless Dream
---
One night I dreamt without sleeping：
“Where’s my love? I’m going to see her.
Kǒm, take the path that leads to her and give it to me.”
  “The path on which you go is the one on which she comes.
  If I take it and give it to you, she cannot come.”
"As long as I go, it will not matter if she does not come.”
  "If I give you her path, she’ll come another way.
  You won’t meet her on your course.”
“Then take this path and give it to my love.”
  “It makes no difference whom I give it to.
  Each person has his own path.”
“Then how will I meet her?”
  “Give yourself to your path.
  Keep going without rest.”
“There are too many peaks and rivers.
I cannot go.”
  “Then I’11 let you hold your love, ” Kǒm replied.
I held her with all my might.
My arms pressed my chest until it hurt,
but the emptiness they divided reunited in their wake.
