Title: Love's Delights
---
I sometimes think You are the reverse
of gravity, causing everything to rise,
from the heavy earth up to the highest skies,

but you show me that Yours is the work of
coming down, of weighting what is light

so that I, like You, might enter into what
is least and raise it up to sound love's
delight in heaven's proper height.
