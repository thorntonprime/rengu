Our own life is to be hated, and the reason is plainï¼š it is because
there is nothing lovely in it. It is a legion of evil, a monstrous
birth of the serpent, the world, and the flesh; it is an apostasy from
the life and power of God in the soul, a life that is death to Heaven,
that is pure unmixed idolatry, that lives wholly to self and not to
God; and therefore all this own life is to be absolutely hated, all
this self is to be denied and mortified, if the nature, spirit.
tempers and inclinations of Christ are to be brought to life in us.
For it is as impossible to live to both these lives at once as for a
body to move two contrary ways at the same time. And therefore all
these mortifications and self-denials have an absolute necessity in
the nature of the thing itself.
