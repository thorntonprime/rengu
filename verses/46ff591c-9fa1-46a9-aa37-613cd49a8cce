Claim nothing for yourself.
Relax and let God operate you and do what He will with you.
The deed is His;
the word is His;
this birth is His;
and all you are is His,
for you have surrendered self to hom,
with all your soul's agents
and their functions
and even your personal nature.

Then at once,
God comes into your being and faculties,
for you are like a desert,
despoiled of all that was peculiarly your own.

The Scripture speaks of
"the voice of one crying in the wilderness."

Let this voice cry in you at will.
Be like a desert as far as self
an the things of this world are concerned.
