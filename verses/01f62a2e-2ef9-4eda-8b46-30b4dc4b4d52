Lao Tzu said, "Artful wisdom, the spirit-like sage - I hope I have
shuffled off categories of that sort! If you'd called me an ox, I'd
have said I was an ox; if you'd called me a horse, I'd have said I was
a horse. If the reality is there and you refuse to accept the name men
give it, you'll only lay yourself open to double harassment. My
submission is a constant submission; I do not submit because I think it
time to submit."
