For God has not brought forth the creation, that he should be thereby
perfect, but for his own manifestation, viz. for the great joy and glory;
not that this joy first began with the creation, no, for it was from eternity
in the great mystery, yet only as a spiritual melody and sport in itself.
The creation is the same sport out of himself, which he melodizesï¼š and it is
even as a great harmony of manifold instruments which are all tuned into
one harmony.
