For the inward work is always better than the outwardï¼š and from it the
outward works of virtue draw all their power and efficacy. It is as if
thou hadst a noble excellent wine, of such virtue that a drop of it
poured into a cask of water would be enough to make all the water
taste like wine and turned it into good wine. This would be a great
miracle; and so it is with the noble, excellent, inward work of the
soul compared to the outward.
