    Title: Addiction to Perfection
By: Marion Woodman
---
Good sailors in the storms of life use their own “I,” their own ego,
to discriminate in what situation to use their masculinity and in what
situation to use their femininity. They build their ego strong enough to
ride with the power of wind and wave. And that ego can only be strong enough
if it is supported by the wisdom of the body whose messages are directly
in touch with the instincts. Without that interplay between spirit and
body, the spirit is always trapped. At the very moment when it could soar,
it is undermined by fear and lack of confidence because it cannot depend
on its instinctual ground even for survival. Without that ground, the
body is experienced as the enemy. Like a boat without a rudder whirling
in panic-stricken circles, the sailor may be dragged into a vortex of
paralysis or terror. If, on the other hand, spirit and body are attuned
to each other, each complements the other with its own special wisdom.
