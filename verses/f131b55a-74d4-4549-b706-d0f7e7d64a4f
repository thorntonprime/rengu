What becomes of the light of the stars when the sun appears on our
horizon? Certainly it perishes not, but it is ravished into and
absorbed in the sun’s sovereign light, with which it is happily
mingled and allied： and what becomes of man’s will when it is
entirely delivered up to God’s pleasure? It does not altogether
perish, yet is it so lost and dispersed in the will of God that it
appears not, and has no other will than the will of God. Consider the
glorious and never sufficiently praised St Louis, embarking and
setting sail for beyond seas： and see the queen, his dear wife,
embarking with his majesty.  Now if any one had asked of this brave
princess： Madam, whither are you going? She would without doubt have
replied. I go whither the king goes As for the places whither he goes,
they are all indifferent to me. and of no consideration whatever,
except so far as he will be in them： for I have no affection for
anything but the king's presence： it is therefore the king that goes,
it is he that designs the journey, but. as for me. I do not go. I only
follow： I desire not the journey, but solely the presence of the
king： the staying, the journeying, and all their circumstances being
utterly indifferent to me.
