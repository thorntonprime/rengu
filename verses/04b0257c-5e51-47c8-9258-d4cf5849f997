Title: Xuefeng Sees A Snake
---
Xuefeng taught the assembly saying "On South Mountain
(alt the south side of the mountain) there is a singular turtle-nosed
snake. You people of various ranks should take a good look."

Changqing said, "Today within the hall, great are the
people who lose body and lose life."

A monk raised this to show to Xuansha. Xuansha said,
"Although in this way it is necessary that Elder Brother
Leng be able to begin, I do not draw near like this."

The monk said, "Venerable, how do you make it come alive?"

Xuansha said, "Why make use of 'South Mountain'?"

Yunmen flung down his staff towards Xuefeng and in front of
his face made gestures of fear.
