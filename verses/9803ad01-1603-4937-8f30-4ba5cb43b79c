Commentary: This is the whole theme of the play -- the closing of the
  houses of resort, for example, represents withdrawal from the senses,
  the prison represents spiritual retreat, etc. The exploration, discovery
  and knowledge of the self is, in fact, the central wheel on which all of
  Shakespeare's drama turns.

Escalus. One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know
himself.
