As it is, the rich are discontented no less than the poor. The poor man
would become a millionaire and the millionaire a multimillionaire. The poor
are often not satisfied when they get just enough to fill their stomachs;
but they are clearly entitled to it and society should makeit a point to
see that they get it.
