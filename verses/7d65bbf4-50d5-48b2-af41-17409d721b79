Title: Mending The Inborn Nature
---
Virtue is harmony, the Way is order. When Virtue embraces all things,
we have benevolence. When the Way is in all respects well ordered, we
have righteousness. When righteousness is clearly understood and all
things cling to it, we have loyalty. When within there is purity,
fullness, and a return to true form, we have music. When good faith is
expressed in face and body and there is a compliance with elegance, we
have rites. But if all emphasis is placed on the conduct of rites and
music, then the world will fall into disorder. The ruler, in his
efforts to rectify, will draw a cloud over his own virtue, and his
virtue will no longer extend to all things. And should he try to force
it to extend, then things would invariably lose their inborn nature.
