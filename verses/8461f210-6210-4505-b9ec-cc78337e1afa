Jo of the North Sea said, "If from the standpoint of the minute we look
at what is large, we cannot see to the end. If from the standpoint of
what is large we look at what is minute, we cannot distinguish it
clearly. The minute is the smallest of the small, the gigantic is the
largest of the large, and it is therefore convenient to distinguish
between them. But this is merely a matter of circumstance. Before we
can speak of coarse or fine, however, there must be some form. If a
thing has no form, then numbers cannot express its dimensions, and if
it cannot be encompassed, then numbers cannot express its size. We can
use words to talk about the coarseness of things and we can use our
minds to visualize the fineness of things. But what words cannot
describe and the mind cannot succeed in visualizing - this has nothing
to do with coarseness or fineness.
