Title: Make a Goofyface
---
Fear likes a moving target. If a tiger were chasing you, your only
chance of survival might be

to stop, turn around, and look into its eyes; then stick your thumbs
in your ears and wiggle your fingers. You might as well try anything
in a

desperate situation, and that seems perilous indeed -- a wild beast's
drooling jaws in your vicinity.

Yes, as a last option, make a goofy face. This could be befitting to
situations in life in general.

And fear, if it thinks it can't take root in you, will go somewhere
else for easier pickings.

Most roots like something still and undisturbed to grow in. There are
always various aspects of nature at play that parallel their parent --
metaphysical laws.

Sit down with a name of God on your tongue, or let your spirit arms
reach within and embrace something sacred there; you might begin to
shine.

All that lives in shadows, all names and forms, will then run from --
or bow to -- the king of the jungle ... your soul, your soul.
