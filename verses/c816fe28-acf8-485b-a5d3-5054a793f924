As the tiger devours other animals, so does the ‘tiger of zeal for the Lord’
eat up lust, anger, and the other passions. Once this zeal grows in the heart,
lust and the other passions disappear. The gopis of Vrindâvan had that state of
mind because of their zeal for Krishna.

Again, this zeal for God is compared to collyrium. Râdhâ said to her friends,
‘I see Krishna everywhere.’ They replied. ‘Friend, you have painted your eyes
with the collyrium of love; that is why you see Krishna everywhere.’
