Title: A Chance to Paint Each Other Gold
---
What would make a lover value you over other lovers they have known?
And tell me about your favorite place to eat, or the finest meal you ever had.
 There is something in caring touch that your memory has recorded ... and
 holds dear, because it nourishes as few things can.
A sincere wanting and need to artfully give is inherent in love. And love
 will get its way; for patience it knows, and what a strength that is.
We subtract or add to our beauty with each movement and sound. Look, we have
 a chance to help paint each other gold.
The closest thing to amorous play with God in form should be the goal of
 any intimacy between us.
Us, those who seek that sacred friendship, and can gaze at each other in
 appreciation, in places we allow few to ever see.
