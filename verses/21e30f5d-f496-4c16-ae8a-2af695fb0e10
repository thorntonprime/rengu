A Châ€™i individual stole some money at a crowded bazaar. He was walking away
with it when the police asked him why it was that he stole the money in the
market.  The thief replied that the sight of the money filled his mind to the
exclusion of the policeman. So his desires made him forgetful of the nature
of his act.
