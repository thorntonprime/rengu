One day Hasan of Basra and Mâlik son of Dînâr and Shakik of Balkh came to see
Râbi'a (al-‘Adawîya) when she was ill. Hasan said, ‘None is sincere in his
claim (to love God) unless he patiently endure the blows of his Lord.’ Râbi'a
said, ‘This smells of egoism.’ Shakik said. ‘None is sincere in his claim
unless he give thanks for the blows of his Lord.’ Râbi’a said, ‘This must be
bettered.’ Mâlik son of Dînâr said. ‘None is sincere in his claim unless he
delight in the blows of his Lord.’ Râbi'a said, ‘This still needs to be
improved." They said, ‘Do thou speak.’ She said, “None is sincere in his
claim unless he forget the blows in beholding his Lord.’
