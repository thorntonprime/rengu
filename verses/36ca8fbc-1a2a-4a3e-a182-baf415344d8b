Never allow yourself boldly to judge your neighbour; judge and condemn
no one, especially for the particular bodily sin of which we are
speaking. If someone has manifestly fallen into it, rather have
compassion and pity for him. Do not be indignant with him or laugh at
him, but let his example be a lesson in humility to you; realizing
that you too are extremely weak and as easily moved to sin as dust on
the road, say to yourself： ‘He Sin fell today, but tomorrow I shall
fall.’ Know that, if you are quick to blame and despise 66 others, God
will mete out a painful punishment to you by letting you fall into the
same sin for which you blame others.
