This great, all-bright and ever-shining sun ... is the visible image
of the Divine Goodness, faintly re-echoing the activity of the
Good. ... And so that Good which is above all light is called a
Spiritual Light because It is an Originating Beam and an Overflowing
Radiance, illuminating with its fullness every Mind above the world,
around it, or within it, and renewing all their spiritual powers,
embracing them all by Its transcendent compass and exceeding them all
by Its transcendent elevation. And It contains within Itself, in a
simple form, the entire ultimate principle of light; and is the
Transcendent Archetype of Light; and, while bearing the light in its
womb, It exceeds it in quality and precedes it in time; and so
conjoineth together all spiritual and rational beings, uniting them in
one.
