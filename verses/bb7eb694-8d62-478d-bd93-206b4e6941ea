It is told that the most blessed Evangelist John, when he was gently stroking a
partridge with his hands, suddenly saw one in the habit of a hunter coming to
him. He wondered that a man of such repute and fame should demean himself to
such small and humble amusements, and said： Art thou that John whose eminent
and widespread fame hath enticed me also with great desire to know thee? Why
then art thou taken up with such mean amusements? The blessed John said to
him： What is that which thou earnest in thy hands? A bow, said he. And why,
said he, dost thou not bear it about always stretched? He answered him： I
must not, lest by constant bending the strength of its vigour be wrung and
grow soft and perish, and when there is need that the arrows be shot with
much strength at some beast, the strength being lost by excess of continual
tension, a forcible blow cannot be dealt. Just so, said the blessed John,
let not this little and brief relaxation of my mind offend thee, young man,
for unless it doth sometimes ease and relax by some remission the force of
its tension, it will grow slack through unbroken rigour and will not be able
to obey the power of the spirit.
