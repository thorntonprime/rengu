Title: The Sense That Love Makes
---
One thing I must admit： a failure of lucidity in regard to love. It is
so easy to assume that love is somehow a solution to a problem. Like：
life is a problem which is impossible until someone comes along that you
can love. Or, man is himself a problem, solved by love. Love is a key to
a hidden answer in us. And so on, but is this true? Or is it only what
everybody wants to be true? Maybe love, like everything else, is in large
measure absurd. Does love too have to make perfect sense? In what way does
it have to?

The sense that love makes, and I think the only sense it makes, is the
beloved. The discovery, the revelation of the absolute value of the
one loved. This is not so much a discovery of meaning as a discovery of
goodness. To think of love as an answer or a “solution” is to evade
the stark directness of this discovery. The fact that you are you is
something of absolute value to me. But ifI love in a certain way, this
becomes covered over and hidden with all the operations of love, and what
happens then is that love takes the place of the beloved. Then love,
instead of being a solution (which it is not supposed to be) becomes
a problem for which there is no solution. For then love stands in the
way between the lovers. It veils the goodness of the beloved. It dresses
(or undresses) the beloved as desirable object. Which is all right, too,
except that one loves desire instead of the beloved.

The fact that you are： that you are you. This is all I have left. But
it is the whole oflove. And nothing can change it.
