Since the celestial spheres revolve and the planets and stars are moved, it
follows that they must have musical notes and expressions with which God is
glorified, delighting the souls of the angels, just as in the corporeal world
our souls listen with delight to melodies and obtain relief from care and
sorrow. And inasmuch as these melodies are but echoes of heavenly music, they
recall to us the spacious gardens of Paradise and the pleasures enjoyed by the
souls dwelling there; and then our souls long to fly up thither and rejoin
their mates.
