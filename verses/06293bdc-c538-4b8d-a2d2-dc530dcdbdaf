It is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
And if he had invented any sayings in Our name,
We assuredly had taken him by the right hand
And then severed his life-artery,
And not one of you could have held Us off from him.
And lo! it is a warrant unto the God-fearing.
And lo! We assuredly know that among you there are deniers.
And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers.
And lo! it is the Truth of Certainty.
So glorify the Name of thy Lord the Tremendous.
