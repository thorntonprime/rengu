  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
Be silent, secret, and conceal
Whate'er you think, whate'er you feel,
Within your soul your dreams should rise
And set like stars that fill the skies
With splendor on their nightly route：
Admire them, scan them, and be mute.

How can a heart at will unfold
Its tale? Can any soul be told
By what it is to live and die?
A thought when spoken is a lie.
The springs men dig for they pollute：
Drink sweet waters and be mute.

Within yourself learn how to live.
Magic that is not fugitive
Lies, a rich treasure, in the mind,
Thoughts that the glare of day will blind
And the wild din without confute：
Heed that low music, and be mute.
