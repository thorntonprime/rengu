Let me try explaining it. What the ordinary world calls 'a man of
perfect wisdom is in fact someone who piles things up for the benefit
of a great thief; what the ordinary world calls a perfect sage is in
fact someone who stands guard for the benefit of a great thief. How do
I know this is so? In times past, Kuan Lung-feng was cut down, Pi Kan
was disemboweled, Ch'ang Hung was torn apart, and Wu Tzu-hsu was left
to rot. All four were worthy men, and yet they could not escape
destruction.
