The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the
kingdom first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their
states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their
families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their
persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts,
they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in
their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such
extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.

Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being
complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their
hearts were then rectified.  Their hearts being rectified, their persons were
cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated.
Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their
states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.
