All ... suffering can be avoided by realizing that God is the only
reality. You are the manifestation of God, a spiritual being emanating from
the one and only source, which is God. Your spirit is eternal -- you live,
breathe and have your being in God. You cannot be separated from God, for
God is the totality and the only reality -- God “is,” nothing else is.
