Title: The Copper Coin Understands
---
The copper coin understands its place amongst the gold.

Any words that can tarnish another know they are meant to one day be
discarded

from your speech, and they will as you mature, grow ripe and can
nourish others more.

The sounds of pure gold are different than anything still alloyed;
what they say never in any way harms.
