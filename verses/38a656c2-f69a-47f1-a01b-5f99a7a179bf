Title: How Is It I Can Love You
---
How is it I can love You
  within me,
  yet see You from afar?

How is it I embrace You
  within myself,
  yet see You spread across the heavens?

You know. You alone.
  You, who made this mystery,
  You who shine
like the sun in my breast,
  You who shine
  in my material heart,
    immaterially.
