(The Gods and Goddesses) have an appearance of so many several distinct
deities; yet they seem to have been all really nothing else, but as Balbus in
Cicero (De Natur. Deor, lib. II. cap, xxviii ... ) expresses it： ‘Deus
pertinens per naturam cujusque rei.’ God passing through, and acting in the
nature of everything.
