Title: Perfect Equanimity
Description: October 2-3
---
Look how a mirror will reflect with perfect equanimity all actions before it.
There is no act in this world that will ever cause the mirror to look away.
There is no act in this world that will ever make the mirror say “no.”
The mirror, like perfect love, will just keep giving of itself to all
 before it.
How did the mirror ever get like that, so polite, so grand, so compassionate?
It watched God.
Yes, the mirror remembers the Beloved looking into itself, into its being,
 as the
Beloved shaped existence’s heart and the mirror’s soul.

My eye has the nature of God. Hafiz looks upon all with perfect equanimity,
 as do my words, dear.
My poems will never tell you “no,” because the mirror is not like that.
And if God ever hits you with a don’t -- He has His fingers crossed.
He is just fibbing for your own good.
