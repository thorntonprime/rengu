Title: To Let Go of All
---
The cup must be empty
to find its true meaning

beyond every kind of
usefulness, so empty

that it would not know
why it is a cup or to

what end, poor and use-
less and without a single

purpose it could know,
which is what I, too,

must learn to be ifI
would be free, striving

to let go of all I hope
might fill me so that all

that is finally left is God.
