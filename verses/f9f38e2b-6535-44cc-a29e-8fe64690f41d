Even though apparently awake, one is still asleep if one sees multiplicity.
Wake up from this dream of ignorance and see the one Self. The Self alone is
real. ...

This world to-day is, to-morrow is notâ€”empty as a dream, shifting like a
circle of fire.  There is but one consciousness -- pure, transcendental --
though it appears as multiple in form.
