Title: Appear an Easy Mark at First
---
The less friction you make as you move through this world, the more power
 you will gather and can store. Fire will take an interest in you and think
 you are an heir to light.
Lightning will start to ride in your purse. When could you then feel cold? What
 divine food could you not prepare, or supply for any?
It is better like this sometimesï¼š Most everyone starts thinking you are
 an easy mark, while in truth, you are just biding your time
waiting for the optimum moment to strike a lethal blow and make a real
 difference. But for that you need forbearance. What lasting good has ever
 been rushed?
When you finally speak up or act with passion you will help tear down some
 walls of tyranny.
