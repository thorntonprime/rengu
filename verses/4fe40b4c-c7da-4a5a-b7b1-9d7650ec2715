What are the two most common goals for people who live in the world? Wealth
and fame. To gain these goals people are willing to lose everything,
including the health of their body, mind and spirit. Not a very good
exchange, is it? Worldly wealth and fame fade so quickly that we wonder
which will last longer, the money, the fame or the man.

But consider the goal of enlightenment, of attaining the wealth of the
Dharma. Those who reach this goal are vigorous in body, keen in mind, and
serene in spiritâ€¦right into eternity.
