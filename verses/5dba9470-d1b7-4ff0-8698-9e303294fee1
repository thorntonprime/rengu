The millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million
is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred
million to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. ... We must
learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical means, but by
an infinite expectation of the dawn.
