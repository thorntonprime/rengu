    Title: Thirty Years to Instant Enlightenment
    Copyright: 2005
    Publisher: Longhouse
  Translator: J.P. Seaton
  Editor: J.P. Seaton
Format: verse
By: Cheng Fu
Title: Freedom's Good
Commentary: |
  Cheng Fu is, other than his name, anonymous： that’s funny. We know only
  that his poem was probably written in the later T’ang, that it was his
  only work to survive. It survives both as an individual poem and as part
  of a linked verse, a collaborative poem form that invites verbal playfulness.

Freedom’s good：
all day long my palace a pine.
Not many get it.
It’s a breeze, I guess
I hear, or
is that just monk-talk.
