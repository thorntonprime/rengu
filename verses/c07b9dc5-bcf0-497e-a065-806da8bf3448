People are always looking for the easy way. The hard way  --   the way learned
by difficult experience and painful realizations  --   doesn’t interest them.
They want a short-cut. True Dharma seekers are afraid of short-cuts. They
know better. They know that without effort, there’s no sense of
accomplishment. It’s that sense that keeps them going.

People who don’t appreciate the struggles of climbing lack understanding of
where they’ve been, awareness of who they are, and determination to
continue climbing. That’s why they never attain the Dharma.
