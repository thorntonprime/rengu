Title: The Diamond Sutraâ€™s Belittled and Despised
---
A test is raised for examination

The Diamond Sutra says, If one becomes a person
belittled and despised, indeed the persons previous lifes karma of
wrongdoing has responded by falling into evil paths. According to the
present life, because the person is belittled and despised, the
previous lifes karma of wrongdoing as a rule becomes extinguished.

Xuedou's ode says
