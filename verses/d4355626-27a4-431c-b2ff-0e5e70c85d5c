The news of the colt’s disappearance soon reached his owner’s ears. He
assembled the chiefs of the tribe and told them what happened. They sent to
Jahir, and he was reproached bitterly. “Jahir,” they said, “you have
not suffered, yet have done injustice in that you carried off that which
belonged to another man." “Say no more,” answered Jahir, “and spare me
these reproaches, for, by the faith of an Arab, I will not return the colt,
unless compelled by main force. I will declare war against you first.”
At that moment the tribe was not prepared for a quarrel; and several of
them said to Jahir, “We are too much attached to you to push things to
such an extreme as that; we are your allies and kinsmen. We will not fight
with you, though an idol of gold were at stake.” Then Kerim, son of Wahrab
(the latter being the owner of the mare and colt, a man renowned among the
Arabs for his generosity), seeing the obstinacy of Jahir, said to him：
“Cousin, the colt is certainly yours, and belongs to you; as for the mare
here, accept her as a present from my hand, so that mother and colt will not
be separated, and no one will be able to accuse me of wronging a kinsman.”

The tribe highly applauded this act, and Jahir was so humiliated by the
generosity with which he had been treated that he returned mare and colt
to Kerim, adding to the gift a pair of male and a pair of female camels.
