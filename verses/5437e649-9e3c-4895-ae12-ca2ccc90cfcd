God can have no delight or union with any creature but because His well-beloved
Son the express image of His person is found in it. This is as true of all
unfallen as of all fallen creatures; the one are redeemed and the other want no
redemption, only through the life of Christ dwelling in them. For as the Word,
or Son of God, is the Creator of all things and by Him every thing is made that
was made, so every thing that is good and holy in unfallen Angels is as much
through His living and dwelling in them as every thing that is good and holy in
redeemed man is through Him. And He is just as much the preserver, the
strength, and glory, and life of all the thrones and principalities of Heaven
as He is the righteousness, the peace, and redemption of fallen man.

This Christ of God has many names in Scripture; but they all mean only this,
that He is, and alone can be, the light and life and holiness of every creature
that is holy, whether in Heaven or on earth.
