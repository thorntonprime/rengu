Yesterday, on orders from Brother Clement and Reverend Father, I marked
the trees Andy Boone is to cut, down in the hollow behind the hermitage,
where the spring is.What a tangle of brush, saplings, vines, fallen trees,
honeysuckle, etc.! Marks of deer everywhere. A fire in there would be
awful. I hope we can get a space of an acre or so good and clear between
here and the spring, and keep it clear. And I can use the spring, for I
need it.All this is the geographical unconscious of my hermitage. Out in
front, the “conscious mind,” the ordered fields, the wide valley, tame
woods. Behind, the “unconscious” -- this lush tangle of life and death,
full of danger, yet where beautiful things move, the deer, and where there
is a spring of sweet, pure water -- buried!

Light rain all night. The need to keep working at meditation -- going to
the root. Mere passivity won’t do at this point. But activism won’t
do either. A time of wordless deepening, to grasp the inner reality
of my nothingness in HimWho Is.Talking about it in these terms seems
absurd. Seems to have nothing to do with the concrete reality that is to
be grasped. My prayer is peace and struggle in silence, to be aware and
true, beyond myself, and to go outside the door of myself, not because
I will it, but because I am called and must respond.
