I.
The window's dark, Roll back the curtain's waves.
What's to be done about sunsets?
Climb up and stand in some high place,
lusting for a little more twilight.

II.
From a thousand houses' cooking fumes,
the Changes weave a single roll of silk.
Whose house, fire still unlit, so late?
Old crow knows whose, and why.

III.
Golden tiles crowd, row on row：
men call this place the Filial Tombs.
Across the vastness, eyes wander：
grand pagoda： one wind-flickering flame.
