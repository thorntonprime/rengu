Title: The End of Love
---
Yes, I’m coming. I’m coming right now.
Oops! I was going to light a candle but I stuck the taper in upside down.
They’ll make fun of me, now.
My love, I’m busy like that.
You scold me for being lazy.
Just look： “Being busy is laziness,” you say.
Why should I be bothered by your scolding?
I only worry that your komun’go is out of tune.

My love, it’s not the moon but the dawn that crosses the skyless sea
to erase the shadow of the elm tree.
The cock in his roost is flapping his wings.
The horse in the stable is pawing the ground.
Yes, I’m coming. I’m coming now.
