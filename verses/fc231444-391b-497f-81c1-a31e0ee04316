This year's crop isn't ripe yet.
Last year's grain's all gone.
So out I go to beg a peck;
outside the gate, I was on one foot, then the other.
The husband came out and said, "Best ask my wife."
The wife came out and said, "Ask the old man."
Hearts hard as that ...
Wealth itself is a great misfortune.
