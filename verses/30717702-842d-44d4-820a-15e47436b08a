\‘A real cloud-soarer.’ said the Patriarch, ‘can start early in the
morning from the Northern Sea, cross the Eastern Sea, the Western Sea and the
Southern Sea, and land again at Ts’ang-wu. Ts’ang-wu means Ling-ling,
in the Northern Sea. To do the round of all four seas in one day is true
cloud-soaring.' ‘It sounds very difficult.’ said Monkey. ‘Nothing in
the world is difficult.’ said the Patriarch, ‘it is only our own thoughts
that make things seem so.’
