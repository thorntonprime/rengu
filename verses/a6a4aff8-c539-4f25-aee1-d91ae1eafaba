  Title: The Man of Many Qualities
---
Confucius visited Lao-tzu, and spoke of charity and duty to one's neighbor.

Lao-tzu saidï¼š "The chaff from winnowing will blind a man's eyes so
that he cannot tell the points of the compass. Mosquitoes will keep a man
awake all night with their biting. And just in the same way this talk of
charity and duty to one's neighbor drives me nearly crazy. Sir! Strive to
keep the world to its own original simplicity. And as the wind bloweth where
it listeth, so let virtue establish itself. Wherefore such undue energy,
as though searching for a fugitive with a big drum.

"The snow -- goose is white without a daily bath. The raven is black
without daily coloring itself. The original simplicity of black and of white
is beyond the reach of argument. The vista of fame and reputation is not
worthy of enlargement. When the pond dries up and the fishes are left upon
dry ground, to moisten them with a little spittle is not to be compared with
leaving them in the first instance in their native rivers and lakes."

On returning from this visit to Lao-tzu, Confucius did not speak for three
days. A disciple asked him, saying, "Master, when you saw Lao-tzu, in what
direction did you admonish him?"

"I saw a dragon," replied Confucius, "a dragon which by convergence
showed a body, by radiation became color, and riding upon the clouds of
heaven, nourished the two principles of creation. My mouth was agape;
I could not shut it. How then do you think I was going to admonish Lao-tzu?"
