Our Buddha Nature is always clear and bright. If we can’t see because our
eyes are darkly veiled with emotional dust. We can’t clean dust with dust
and we can’t calm emotions with emotions. So how do we remove that veil? We
use Dharma wisdom. Enlightenment lifts the veil and illuminates our Buddha
Face.
