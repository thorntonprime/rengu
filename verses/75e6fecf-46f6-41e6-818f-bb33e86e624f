The Creature truly really is in the proper rank and order of its own Being, but
all that is, in the presence of the Divine Being, in comparison with it, is
like a dream, when one awakes, less than nothing. ... The Creature is nothing
of it self, or by it self but a momentary emanation from God, sent forth from
him, and filled with him. God is not the Creature, yet he is in the Creature.
