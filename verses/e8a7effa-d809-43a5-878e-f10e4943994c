In the supreame, & inward part of itselfe it (the Soul) conteineth all fformes
of things in their Originall, Eternall, Glorious Truths, & substances. In it’s
lower, & more outward part, which is still itselfe, & within itselfe it
bringeth forth itselfe sportingly into a shadowie ffigure of itselfe & in this
shadowie ffigure ito innumerable shadowes, & ffigures of those glorious fformes
in it’s superior part. This shadowie ffigure is that, which wee call this
world, & the body. The Soule often looking upon this, like Narcissus upon his
owne fface in the ffountaine, forgets it to be itselfe, forgets that itselfe
is the fface, the shadow, & the ffountaine, so it falls into a fond Love of
itselfe in it’s owne shadowie ffigure of itselfe. So it languisheth, & dys
becoming only a Shadow of itselfe. in which itselfe with all it’s superior,
and true Glories ly buried.
