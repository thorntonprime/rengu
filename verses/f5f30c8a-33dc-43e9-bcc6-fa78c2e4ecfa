The soul is like a dish full of water, and the impressions like the rays of
light which strike the water. Now when the water is disturbed the light seems
to be disturbed too, but it is not really disturbed. So when a man has a fit
of dizziness, the arts and virtues are not put to confusion, but only the
spirit in which they existï¼š when this is at rest, they come to rest too.
