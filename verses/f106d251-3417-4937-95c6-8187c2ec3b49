Title: The Necessity of Adoration
---
“Nothing is more necessary than to adore the living God," says the Rule
for Recluses. It seems a platitude -- really it is a deep, mysterious,
unfathomable, living need -- an imperative for one’s whole life, a demand
that is often forgotten and not met. I am in solitude precisely to confront
this demand and others like it (in Zen terms, for example). I recognize I
do not cope with the others really. Yet I must keep on with it, however much
I fumble around. No one else can tell me what to do now： I have to try to
find out for myself (of course people will come at the right time with the
right word -- books, too -- but I have no one to rely on. This is my life
and I don’t pretend to understand it. Only, the mere playing of a role
would be intolerable and mere living is also not enough, though at times it
seems to resolve itselfinto that.There is living and then there is living.
