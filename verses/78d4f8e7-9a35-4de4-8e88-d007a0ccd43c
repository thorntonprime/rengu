The soul in her totality ... traverses the whole heaven in divers forms
appearingï¼š -- when perfect and fully winged she soars upward, and orders
the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul, losing her wings and drooping
in her flight at last settles on the solid ground -- there, finding a home,
she receives an earthly frame which appears to be self-moved, but is really
moved by her power; and this composition of soul and body is called a living
and mortal creature. ...

The wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine, and which
by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates downwards into
the upper region, which is the habitation of the gods. The divine is beauty,
wisdom, goodness, and the like; and by these the wing of the soul is nourished,
and grows apace; but when fed upon evil and foulness and the opposite of good,
wastes and falls away
