Through birth and rebirth’s endless round,
Seeking in vain, I hastened on,
To find who framed this edifice.
What misery!—birth incessantly!

O builder! I’ve discovered thee!
This fabric thou shalt ne’er rebuild!
Thy rafters all are broken now,
And pointed roof demolished lies!
This mind has demolition reached,
And seen the last of all desire!
