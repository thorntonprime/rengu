Title: There Is No Place for Place!
---
There is no place for place!
How can a place
house the maker of all space,
or the vast sky enclose
  the maker of heaven?

He told me：
“I am a homeless treasure.
The world was made
to give you a place to stand
  and see me.”

Tell me, if the one you seek
is placeless,
why put your shoes on?
The real road is found by polishing, polishing 
  the mirror of your heart.
