Title: Because of Our Wisdom
---
In many parts of the world water is scarce and precious.
People sometimes have to walk a great distance, then carry heavy jugs upon
 their heads.
Because of our wisdom, we will travel far for love. All movement is a sign
 of thirst.
Most speaking really says, “I am hungry to know you.”
Every desire of your body is holy; every desire of your body is holy.
Dear one, why wait until you are dying to discover that divine truth?
