This therefore is one and the best extension (of the soul) to (the highest)
God, and is as much as possible irreprehensible; viz, to know firmly, that
by ascribing to him the most venerable excellencies we can conceive, and the
most holy and primary names and things, we ascribe nothing to him which is
suitable to his dignity. It is sufficient, however, to procure our pardon
(for the attempt) that we can attribute to him nothing superior.
