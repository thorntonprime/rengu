The first vibration which took place at the commencement of creation, that is,
on the disturbance of equilibrium (Vaishamyavastha), was a general movement
(SamanyaSpanda) in the whole mass of Prakriti. This was the Pranava-Dhvani
or OM sound. OM is only the approximate representation or gross form of the
subtle sound which is heard in Yoga-experience.
