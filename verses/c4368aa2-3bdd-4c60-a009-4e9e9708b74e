\[Napoleon] spoke of the Russian nobles, who in the event of war, would
fear for their palaces, and, after a good battle, would force the Tsar to
conclude a peace.

“Your Majesty is mistaken,” [Caulaincourt] replied. ... “’If
the Emperor Napoleon makes war on me,’ the Tsar Alexander said to me,
’it is possible, even probable, that we shall be defeated; assuming
that we fight. But that will not mean that he can dictate a peace . ... We
have plenty of room; and our standing army is well-organized, which means,
as the Emperor Napoleon has admitted, that we need never accept a dictated
peace, whatever reverses we may suffer. What is more, in such circumstances
the victor is forced to accept the terms of the vanquished. The Emperor
Napoleon made a remark to this effect to Tchernychev in Vienna after the
battle of Wagram. He would not have made peace if Austria had not kept an
army intact . ... I shall not be the first to draw my sword, but I shall be
the last to sheathe it . ... The Emperor Napoleon’s remark to Tchemychev,
in the latest war with Austria, shows clearly enough that the Austrians
could have obtained better terms if they had been more persevering. People
don’t know how to suffer. If the fighting went against me, I should
retire to Kamchatka rather than cede provinces and sign, in my capitol,
treaties that were really only truces. Your Frenchman is brave; but long
privations and a bad climate wear him down and discourage him. Our climate,
our winter, will fight on our side. With you, marvels only take place where
the Emperor is in personal attendance; and he cannot be everywhere. He
cannot be absent from Paris year after year.’”
