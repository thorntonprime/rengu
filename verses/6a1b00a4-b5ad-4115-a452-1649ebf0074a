Commentary: Here the Lamb is akin to the Vedic Agni.
---
He carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed
me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.

Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious,
even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; ...

And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it;
for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. ...

And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light
of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for
ever and ever.
