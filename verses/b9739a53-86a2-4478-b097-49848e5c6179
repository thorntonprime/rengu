I have meditated on the different religions, endeavouring to understand them,
and I have found that they stem from a single principle with numerous
ramifications. Do not therefore ask a man to adopt a particular religion
(rather than another), for this would separate him from the fundamental
principle; it is this principle itself which must come to seek him; in it are
all the heights and all the meanings elucidated; then he will understand them.
