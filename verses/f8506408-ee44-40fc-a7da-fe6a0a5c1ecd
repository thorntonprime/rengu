    Title: The Seat of the Soul
By: Gary Zukav

So powerful is the energy of the soul that it could not advance into a
physical form without, literally, exploding that form. In the creation of a
personality, the soul calibrates parts of itself, reduces parts of itself,
to take on the human experience. Your higher selfis that aspect of your soul
that is in you, but it is not the fullness of your soul. It is a smaller
soul self. Therefore, “higher self“ is another term for “soul,” yet
the soul is more than the higher self.

Picture a cup, a gallon and a water tank. The water tank is the soul. An
aspect of the soul becomes a gallon. That gallon is still soul, but not
the fullness of the soul. It is that part of the soul that is on mission,
so to speak. The personality is the cup. The cup contacts the gallon, the
higher self soul, but not the full-bodied water tank.
