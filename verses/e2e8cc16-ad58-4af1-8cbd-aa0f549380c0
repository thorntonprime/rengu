Let go of the past, let go of the future,
  Let go of the present.
Gone beyond becoming,
  With the mind released in every way,
You do not again suffer the cycle of existence.

For people who
  Have agitated thoughts
  And instense passion,
  And who are focused on what's pleasant,
Craving grows more and more,
  Strengthening the bonds of suffering.

But those who
  Delight in calming their thoughts,
  Are always mindful,
  And learn to accept the unpleasant,
Will bring an end to craving,
  And break the bonds of suffering and death.
