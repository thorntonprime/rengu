A man must wholly die to self hood in the death, and give himself up
in the resigned will wholly into the obedience of God, as a new child
of a new will; ... without this there is only the form, viz. the
history1 that was once brought to pass, and that a man need only
accept of it, and comfort himself therewithï¼š but this will remains
without, for it will be a child of an assumed grace, and not wholly
die to its self hood in the grace, and become a child of grace in the
resigned will.
