Title: Distance Yields
---
It knew it had no chance. Distance yielded.

Like two opponents meeting and one seeing it was easily ten times more powerful
  than the other,

so the greater warrior just turned and walked away, but a spear was thrown into
  its back, but that was really nothing; it would be pulled out and laid aside,
  and even bowed to.

My love has become like that： Ten times the strength of anything that might
  ever think to war with me. And any words shaped like arrows, what are those
  to someone my size?

Distance yields. I guess there are two ways of looking at this, aren't there?
  One is： Something will grow in your future. And that is true.

And the other way is： All surrender to the alive heart, and to the eyes that
  can be always giving.

May I make a request of my friends? Would you put some of my words into songs?

It doesn't have to be any words here; they can come from another bin.
