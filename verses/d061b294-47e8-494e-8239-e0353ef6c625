You may try thousands of times, but nothing can be achieved without
God’s grace. One cannot see God without His grace. Is it an easy thing
to receive the grace of God? One must altogether renounce egotism; one
cannot see God as long as one feels. ‘I am the doer.’ ... God doesn’t
easily appear in the heart of a man who feels himself to be his own
master.  But God can be seen the moment His grace descends.
