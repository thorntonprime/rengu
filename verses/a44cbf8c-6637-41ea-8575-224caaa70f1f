Whilst possessed of all (objects oD desires he (the solar comprehensor) is
without desire, for no desire of anything (troubles) him.

Regarding this there is this verse -- ‘By knowledge they ascend that (state)
where desires have vanished; sacrificial gifts go not thither, nor the fervid
practisers of rites without knowledge;’ -- for, indeed, he who does not know
this does not attain to that world either by sacrificial gifts or by devout
practices, but only to those who know does that world belong.
