Title: East Mountain Moves over the Water
Description: Commentary on Fukushima Keido Ichigyo Scroll
By: John Daido Loori

The saying “East Mountain moves over the water" is usually attributed
to the great master Yunmen.

A monastic asked Yunmen. “What is the birth place of all buddhas?”
Yunmen answered. “East Mountain moves over the water.”

“East Mountain” is another name for Mount Yunmen, but we should also
understand that all mountains are East Mountain, and that all of these
East Mountains are moving over the water; As the great master Dogen has
said, “Once we understand that both the self and mountains are beyond
notions of sentient and insentient, then we will have no doubts about
East Mountain walking over water."
