The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing
of hating death. He emerged without delight; he went back in without a
fuss. He came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all. He didn't
forget where he began; he didn't try to find out where he would end. He
received something and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and
handed it back again. This is what I call not using the mind to repel
the Way, not using man to help out Heaven. This is what I call the True
Man.
