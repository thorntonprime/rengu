What a revelation this crisis has been to me in regard to human nature,
above all, of the intellectual elite, How quickly and totally have these
thinkers, so imbued with the great principles of liberty and humanity
renounced them and toppled them in the dust! I will not forget it in the
sequel when, with peace once more established, I shall be seeing them
again professing their ideas, flaunting their spirit, its liberality and
its kinships with all that is human.
