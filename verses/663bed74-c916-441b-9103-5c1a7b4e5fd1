The ancient kings were ever careful about things that affected the human heart.
They tried therefore to guide the people’s ideals and aspirations by means of
Li, establish harmony in sounds by means of music, regulate conduct by means of
government, and prevent immorality by means of punishments. Li, music,
punishments and government have a common goal, which is to bring about unity in
the people’s hearts and carry out the principles of political order.

Music rises from the human heart. When the emotions are touched, they are
expressed in sounds, and when the sounds take definite forms, we have music.
Therefore the music of a peaceful and prosperous country is quiet and joyous,
and the government is orderly; the music of a country in turmoil shows
dissatisfaction and anger, and the government is chaotic; and the music of a
destroyed country shows sorrow and remembrance of the past, and the people are
distressed. Thus we see music and government are directly connected with one
another.
