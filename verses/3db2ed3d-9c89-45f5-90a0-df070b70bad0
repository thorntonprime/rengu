Title: Mending The Inborn Nature
---
Those in ancient times who wished to keep themselves alive did not use
eloquence to ornament their knowledge. They did not use their knowledge
to make trouble for the world; they did not use their knowledge to make
trouble for Virtue. Loftily they kept to their places and returned to
their inborn nature. Having done that, what more was there for them to
do? The way has no use for petty conduct; Virtue has no use for petty
understanding. Petty understanding injures Virtue; petty conduct
injures the Way. Therefore it is said, Rectify yourself, that is all.
When joy is complete, this is called the fulfillment of ambition.
