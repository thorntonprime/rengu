Title: The Great And Venerable Teacher
---
The Way has its reality and its signs but is without action or form.
You can hand it down but you cannot receive it; you can get it but you
cannot see it. It is its own source, its own root. Before Heaven and
earth existed it was there, firm from ancient times. It gave
spirituality to the spirits and to God; it gave birth to Heaven and to
earth. It exists beyond the highest point, and yet you cannot call it
lofty; it exists beneath the limit of the six directions, and yet you
cannot call it deep. It was born before Heaven and earth, and yet you
cannot say it has been there for long; it is earlier than the earliest
time, and yet you cannot call it old.
