The Throne of the most High God, is a Throne of Grace, of Love. Like a Chain
doth the whole Nature of things descend from this Throne, having its top
fastned to it. What ever the weights may be of the lowermost links of this
Chain, yet that Love which sits upon the Throne, with a Divine delight as
it lets down the Chain from it self, so draws it up again by the Order of
the successive Links unto a Divine Ornament, an eternal Joy and Glory to it
self. All things of Nature in its Beauties, all things of Nature in its Ruine,
Life and Death in all forms, are a Saints, a Saint is Christs, Christ is Gods.
