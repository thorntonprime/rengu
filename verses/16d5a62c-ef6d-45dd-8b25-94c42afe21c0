“Oh, it is true, my friend, man is naturally a serious animal. We must
work against this shameful and abominable propensity with all our strength,
and attack it from all sides. To that end ambiguities are also good,
except that they are so seldom ambiguous. When they are not and allow
only one interpretation, that is not immoral, it is only obtrusive and
vulgar. Frivolous talk must be spiritual and dainty and modest, so far as
possible; for the rest as wicked as you choose.”

“That is well enough, but what place have your ambiguities in society?”

“To keep the conversations fresh, just as salt keeps food fresh. The
question is not why we say them, but how we say them. It would be rude
indeed to talk with a charming lady as if she were a sexless Amphibium. It
is a duty and an obligation to allude constantly to what she is and is
going to be. It is really a comical situation, considering how indelicate,
stiff and guilty society is, to be an innocent girl.”

“That reminds me of the famous Buffo, who, while he was always making
others laugh, was so sad and solemn himself.”

“Society is a chaos which can be brought into harmonious order only by
wit. If one does not jest and toy with the elements of passion, it forms
thick masses and darkens everything.”
