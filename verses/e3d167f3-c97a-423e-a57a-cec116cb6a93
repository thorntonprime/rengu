Now, though many years did not pass after the age of the apostles before
Satan and self got footing in the Church and set up merchandise in the house
of God, yet this one heart and one spirit which then first appeared in the
Jerusalem Church is that one heart and spirit of divine love to which all
are called that would be true disciples of Christ. And though the practice of
it is lost as to the Church in general, yet it ought not to have been lost;
and therefore every Christian ought to make it his great care and prayer to
have it restored in himself. And then, though born in the dregs of time or
living in Babylon, he will be as truly a member of the first heavenly Church
at Jerusalem as if he had lived in it in the days of the apostles.
