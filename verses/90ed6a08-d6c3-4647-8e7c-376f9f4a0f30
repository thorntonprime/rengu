Title: To Use Sorrow
---
What you say of your life -- that its most painful event was also its
greatest -- that is, so to speak, the secret theme of these pages, indeed
the inner belief that gave rise to them. It is the conviction that what
is greatest in our existence, what makes it precious beyond words, has the
modesty to use sorrow in order to penetrate our soul.
