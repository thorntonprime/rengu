I have fallen in love, O mother, with the
  Beautiful One. who knows no death,
  knows no decay and has no form;

I have fallen in love. O mother, with the
  Beautiful One. who has no middle, has
  no end. has no parts and has no features;

I have fallen in love. O mother, with the
  Beautiful One. who knows no birth and
  knows no fear.

I have fallen in love with the Beautiful
  One. who is without any family,
  without any country and without any peer;
Chenna Mallikârjuna, the Beautiful, is my husband.
Fling into the fire the husbands who are subject
  to death and decay.
