Title: The Source
---
Just as the sun illumines the air and shines through it,
but keeps its source for itself, so You pour all pleasure

and every delight into eveW one of your creatures --
and into me -- and yet You keep the root of pleasure

and guard delight's essence in Yourself so that
I might seek You as the ever-giving source of

what gives true pleasure and lasting delight.
