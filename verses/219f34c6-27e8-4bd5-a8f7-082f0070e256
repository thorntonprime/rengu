Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
The Great Way is not named; Great Discriminations are not spoken; Great
Benevolence is not benevolent; Great Modesty is not humble; Great
Daring does not attack. If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way. If
discriminations are put into words, they do not suffice. If benevolence
has a constant object, it cannot be universal. If modesty is
fastidious, it cannot be trusted. If daring attacks, it cannot be
complete. These five are all round, but they tend toward the square.
