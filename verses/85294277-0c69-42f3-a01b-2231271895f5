Neither are they correct who dedicate themselves to exposing the fraud of
every sensory object they encounter. True, perceptions of material objects
give rise to wild desire in the heart. True, once it is understood how
essentially worthless such apparent objects are, wild desires are reduced
to timid thoughts. But we may not limit our spiritual practice to the
discipline of dispelling illusion. There is more to the Dharma than
understanding the nature of reality.
