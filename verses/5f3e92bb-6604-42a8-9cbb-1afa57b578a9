Title: Of two ghostly devices that be helpful to a ghostly beginner in
  the work of this book
---
Nevertheless, somewhat of this subtlety shall I tell thee as me think. Prove
thou and do better, if thou better mayest. Do that in thee is, to let be as
thou wist not that they press so fast upon thee betwixt thee and thy God. And
try to look as it were over their shoulders, seeking another thing： the
which thing is God, enclosed in a cloud of unknowing. And if thou do thus,
I trow that within short time thou shalt be eased of thy travail. I trow
that an this device be well and truly conceived, it is nought else but a
longing desire unto God, to feel Him and see Him as it may be here： and
such a desire is charity, and it obtaineth always to be eased.

Another device there is： prove thou if thou wilt. When thou feelest that
thou mayest on nowise put them down, cower thou down under them as a caitiff
and a coward overcome in battle, and think that it is but a folly to thee
to strive any longer with them, and therefore thou yieldest thee to God in
the hands of thine enemies. And feel then thyself as thou wert foredone for
ever. Take good heed of this device I pray thee, for me think in the proof
of this device thou shouldest melt all to water. And surely me think an this
device be truly conceived it is nought else but a true knowing and a feeling
of thyself as thou art, a wretch and a filthy, far worse than nought： the
which knowing and feeling is meekness. And this meekness obtaineth to have
God Himself mightily descending, to venge thee of thine enemies, for to take
thee up, and cherishingly dry thine ghostly eyen; as the father doth the child
that is in point to perish under the mouths of wild swine or wode biting bears.
