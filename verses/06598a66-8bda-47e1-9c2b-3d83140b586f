One of the most beloved of twentieth century Zen masters. Gempo Roshi
taught his followers at Ryutaktrji, a countryside temple founded by Hakuin
and Torei. Rejoicing at the birth of a child to one of his parishioner
families, he created this charming image. Wishing the child â€œlongevity
and radiance" in his two word inscription. The rounded form and simplified
face of the baby make universal the sense of the joy that new life brings.
