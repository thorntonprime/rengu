  - Invocation=The Universal Elixir
  - Life-Love=Love=Via Amoris
By: Richard of Saint-Victor

And this is the invocation of the Name; this is the possession of salvation,
the receiving of kisses, the communion of the bed, the union of the Word with
the soul in which every man is saved. For with such light no one can be blind,
with such power no one can be weak, with such salvation none can perish.
