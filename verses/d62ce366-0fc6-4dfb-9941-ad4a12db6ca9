Title: The Way Of Heaven
---
Therefore the kings of the world in ancient times, though their
knowledge encompassed all Heaven and earth, did not of themselves lay
plans; though their power of discrimination embraced  the ten thousand
things, they did not of themselves expound any theories; though their
abilities outshone all within the four seas, they did not of themselves
act. Heaven does not give birth, yet the ten thousand things are
transformed; earth does not sustain, yet the ten thousand things are
nourished. The emperor and the king do not act, yet the world is
benefited. So it is said, nothing so spiritual as Heaven, nothing so
rich as earth, nothing so great as the emperor and the king. So it is
said, the Virtue of the emperor and the king is the counterpart of
Heaven and earth. This is the way to mount upon Heaven and earth, to
make the ten thousand things gallop, to employ the mass of men.
