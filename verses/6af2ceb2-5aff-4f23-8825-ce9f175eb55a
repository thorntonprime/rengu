Title: Freedom Within Boundaries
---
Cold day with sun. The snow melts slowly.

Ajet plane swooped low over the monastery with an interesting roar and
then started climbing beautifully into the north, at great speed, with
a flight I could not help but love and admire. In a few seconds it was
high enough for the exhaust to come out white in a long trail.

Perhaps I have been struggling with an illusory idea of freedom, as if I
were not, to a great extent, bound by my own history, the history of
Gethsemani, of the country where I have become a citizen, etc.There are
only certain very limited and special avenues of freedom open to me now,
and it is useless to fight my way along where no issue is possible. This
is true not only exteriorly but even interiorly and spiritually. To say
that God can open up new ways is perhaps, among other things, to admit
only that He has provided ways for me of which I cannot yet be aware,
since I am too intent upon imaginary and experimental ones.
