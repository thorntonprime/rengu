Sermons? There must be a million.
Too many to read in a hurry ...
But if you want a friend,
just come on out to T'ien-t'ai.
Sitting deep among the crags,
we'll talk about True Principles
and chat about Dark Mysteries.
If you don't come to my mountain,
your view will be blocked
by all of the others.
