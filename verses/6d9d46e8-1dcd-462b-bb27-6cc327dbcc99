The Nembutsu is compared to gold, which, when burned in the fire, only has
its colour improved, and receives no injury though thrown into the water. In
the same way the Nembutsu, though said when evil passions arise, is not
defiled, nor does it lose its value though said when you are in conversation
with others.
