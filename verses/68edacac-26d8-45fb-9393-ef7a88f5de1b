Title: When No One Can Say the Right Words
---
When the body begins to die, and no one can
say the right words,

it is then that a poem may find the courage to
come forth and try to be with you.

So intimate is the experience of death, in some
ways even more so than birth.

All the work you have done for self and family
and maybe even the world, whatever labor it
was, it should be known -- it was really astounding.

And what your did just standing in an hour ...
against all time,

herculean your efforts, your every movement;
that is true. You can rest now, dear. Rest.

Turn into what you were before you came. That
will be offered before you leave us.

The miraculous will not end. Even sweeter you
will smile.

And if you wish, a cheek you cherished, you will
soon touch again.
