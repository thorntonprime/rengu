Title: The Mother of God
---
A conscious and eternal Power is here
Behind unhappiness and mortal birth
And the error of Thought and blundering trudge of Time.
The Mother of God, his sister and his spouse,
Daughter of his wisdom, of his might the mate,
She has leapt from the Transcendent’s secret breast
To build her rainbow worlds of mind and life.
Between the superconscient absolute Light
And the Inconscient’s vast unthinking toil
In the rolling and routine of Matter's sleep
And the somnambulist motion ofthe stars
She forces on the cold unwilling Void
Her adventure of life, the passionate dreams of her lust.
Amid the work of darker Powers she is here
To heal the evils and mistakes of Space
And change the tragedy of the ignorant world
Into a Divine Comedy ofjoy
And the laughter and the rapture of God‘s bliss.
The Mother of God is master of our souls;
We are the partners ofhis birth in Time,
Inheritors we share his eternity.
