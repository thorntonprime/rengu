The policy begun by Louis in 1661 was well established and had borne fruit
by the time Versailles became the seat of government. Throughout France
there was not a single estate of any size the proprietor of which was not
at court. The new hotels of the nobility lined the streets near the royal
palace, and their owners filled its salons and formed each day a cortege for
the king. ... Each morning when the king went to mass, an obsequious nobility
awaited him in the gallery of Versailles. They were all there; all, at least,
whose purses were not empty. "Sire," said M, de Verdes to Louis XIV,
"away from Your Majesty, one is not only miserable but ridiculous."

But such concentration imposed a heavy load upon the sovereign; it was the
price he had to pay for his absolutism. As Taine has well said, "A nobility
for useful purposes is not transformed with impunity into a nobility for
ornament. ... The king is expected to keep the entire aristocracy busy,
consequently to make a display of himself, to pay back with his own person
at all hours. It is the life of an actor who is on the stage the entire day."

The nobility had their price to pay. The cost of living at court ate up
their incomes; their continued absence from their estates made their revenues
diminish, left their Chateaux neglected, and much of their land uncultivated;
high play plunged them into debt. A few years brought the inevitable, and
they became dependent on the royal bounty. When they looked for support to
the salaries attached to their posts at court, and to the king's pensions,
the last traces of their independence vanished.
