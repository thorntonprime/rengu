Take ten parts of our air; one part of living gold or living silver; put all
this into your vessel; subject the air to coction, until it becomes first
water, and then something which is not water. If you do not know how to do
this, and how to cook air, you will go wrong, for herein is the true Matter
of the Philosophers. You must take that which is, but is not seen until the
operator pleases. This is the water of our dew, which is extracted from-the
saltpetre of the Sages, by which all things grow, exist, and are nourished,
whose womb is the centre of the celestial and terrestrial sun and moon. To
speak more openly, it is our Magnet, which I have already called our Chalybs,
or steel. Air generates this magnet, the magnet engenders or manifests our air.
