Commentary: That the Self Itself is Liberation is the conclusion.
---
Liberation becomes artificial and therefore transitory according to the
philosopher who holds that it is a change of one state into another (on
the part of the Self). Again it is not reasonable that it is a union (with
Brahman) or a separation (from Nature). As both union and separation are
transitory Liberation cannot consist of the individual self going to Brahman
or of Brahman coming to it. But the Self, one’s own real natuie is never
destroyed. For It is uncaused and cannot be accepted or rejected by oneself.
