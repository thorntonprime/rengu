The very nature of mind and body is clear and calm and possesses not a
single thought. It is the ego that thinks just as it is the ego that thinks
that it desires not to think. The ego causes problems it tries to solve. To
be empty of ego is to hear the soundless sound, to see the invisible sight,
to think the thoughtless thought.
