Zen Master Zobo Bunga resurrects one of Master Hakuin's miscellaneous koans,
“The Bridge Flows, the Water Does Not,“ This is one of a few hundred
koans that follow the koan " Mu" in systematic koan introspection. The
question here is, how is it that the bridge flows, and the water does
not? Don‘t explain. Show me. The only entrance into seeing this koan
is to abandon your reference system and be the koan. Haven't you heard
Master Dogen‘s teaching, “If one examines the ten thousand dharmas
with a deluded body and mind, one will suppose that ones mind and nature
are permanent But if one practices intimately and returns to the true self
it will be clear that the ten thousand dharmas are without self.” Just
let go of the reference system.
