Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
If a man follows the mind given him and makes it his teacher, then who
can be without a teacher? Why must you comprehend the process of change
and form your mind on that basis before you can have a teacher? Even an
idiot has his teacher. But to fail to abide by this mind and still
insist upon your rights and wrongs - this is like saying that you set
off for Yueh today and got there yesterday. This is to claim that what
doesn't exist exists. If you claim that what doesn't exist exists, then
even the holy sage Yu couldn't understand you, much less a person like
me!
