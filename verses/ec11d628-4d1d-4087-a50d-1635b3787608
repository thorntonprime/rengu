Our air, like the air of the firmament, divides the waters： and as the waters
under the firmament are visible to us mortals, while we are unable to see the
waters above the firmament, so in ’our work’ we see the extracentral mineral
waters, but are unable to see those which, though hidden within, nevertheless
have a real existence. They exist but do not appear until it please the Artist.
