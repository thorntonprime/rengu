Title: Discussion On Making All Things Equal
---
For this reason, whether you point to a little stalk or a great pillar,
a leper or the beautiful Hsi-shih, things ribald and shady or things
grotesque and strange, the Way makes them all into one. Their
dividedness is their completeness; their completeness is their
impairment. No thing is either complete or impaired, but all are made
into one again. Only the man of far reaching vision knows how to make
them into one. So he has no use [for categories], but relegates all to
the constant. The constant is the useful; the useful is the passable;
the passable is the successful; and with success, all is accomplished.
He relies upon this alone, relies upon it and does not know he is doing
so. This is called the Way.
