Honoring yin and yang,
do you embrace the One?
Focusing your chi within,
are you soft as if newborn?
Tending the mirror dark within,
do you keep it blemish-free?
Caring for the citizenry,
are you unassuming?
As heaven's portals open and close,
do you receive as yin?
As your knowledge grows,
do you still know nothing, too?

Creating, not claiming as one's own,
working, not waiting for return,
guiding, not seeking to control,
such is the wonder of integrity.
