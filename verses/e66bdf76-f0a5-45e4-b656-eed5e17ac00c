For thirty years God Most High was my mirror, now I am my own mirror
and that which I was I am no more, for ‘I’ and ‘God’ represents
polytheism, a denial of His Unity. Since I am no more, God Most High is His
own mirror. Behold, now I say that God is the mirror of myself, for with my
tongue He speaks and I have passed away.
