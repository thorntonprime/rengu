Damnation is no foreign, separate, or imposed state that is brought in
upon us, or adjudged to us by the will of God, but is the inborn,
natural, essential state of our own disordered nature, which is
absolutely impossible in the nature of the thing to be anything else
but our own hell both here and hereafter, unless all sin be separated
from us and righteousness be again made our natural state by a birth
of itself in us. And all this, not because God will have it so by an
arbitrary act of His sovereign will but because He cannot change His
own nature or make anything to be happy and blessed, but only that
which has its proper righteousness and is of one will and spirit with
Himself.
