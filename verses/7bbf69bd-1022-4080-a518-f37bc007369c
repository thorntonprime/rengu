As a thing begins, so it ends. Out of one arise two, and out of two one -- as of
God the Father there was begotten God the Son, and from the two proceeded God
the Holy Ghost.  Thus was the world made, and so also shall it end. Consider
carefully these few points, and you will find, firstly, the Father, then the
Father and the Son, lastly, the Holy Spirit. You will find the four elements,
the four luminaries, the two celestials, the two centrics. In a word, there
is nothing, has been, and shall be nothing in the world which is otherwise
than it appears in this symbol, and a volume might be filled with its
mysteries.
