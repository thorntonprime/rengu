The rich are admired because they’ve saved money. But what’s been saved can
be spent. The admiration goes with the money. A king receives loyalty
because his people regard him as noble. If they decide he’s acting badly,
he may lose more than his throne. Those who are rich in the Dharma and
noble in the Buddha’s Way always retain their wealth and the fealty of the
people.
