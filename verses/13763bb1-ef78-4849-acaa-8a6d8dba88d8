Title: Our Blindness
---
Although it is almost unbelievable to imagine this country being laid to waste,
yet that is very probably what is going to happen. Without serious reason,
without people “wanting” it, and without them being able to prevent it,
because of their incapacity to use the power they have acquired, they must
be used by it.

Hence the absolute necessity of taking this fact soberly into account and
living in the perspectives that it establishes -- an almost impossible task.

1. Preeminence of meditation and prayer, of self-emptying, cleaning out,
getting rid of the self that blocks the View of truth.The self that says it
will be here and then that it will not be here.

2. Preeminence of compassion for every living thing, for life, for the
defenseless and simple beings, for the human race in its blindness. For
Christ, crucified in His image. Eucharistic sacrifice, without justification.

3. Weariness of words, except in friendship, and in the simplest and most
direct kind of communication, by word of mouth or letter.

4. Preeminence of the silent and inconclusive action -- if any presents
itself. And meaningful suffering, accepted in complete sflence, without
justification.
