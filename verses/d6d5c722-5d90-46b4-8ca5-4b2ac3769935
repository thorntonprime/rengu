At nightfall he (Dhu ’l-Nûn) entered a ruined building, where he found a
jar of gold and jewels covered by a board on which was inscribed the name of
God. His friends divided the gold and jewels, but Dhu 'l-Nûn said, ’Give
me this board, my Beloved's name is upon it'; and he did not cease kissing it
all day. Through the blessing thereof he attained to such a degree that one
night he dreamed and heard a voice saying to him, ‘O Dhu 'l-Nûn! the others
were pleased with gold and precious jewels, but thou wert pleased only with
My name; therefore have I opened unto thee the gate of knowledge and wisdom.'
