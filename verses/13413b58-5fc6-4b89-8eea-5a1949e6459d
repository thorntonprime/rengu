All sins are contained in this one category, that one turns away from things
divine and truly enduring, and turns towards those which are mutable and
uncertain. And although the latter are rightly placed each in its order, and
work out that beauty proper to them it is nevertheless the mark of a perverted
and ungoverned mind to be in subjection to them as things to be pursued, when
by the divine order and law it is set above them as things to be directed.
