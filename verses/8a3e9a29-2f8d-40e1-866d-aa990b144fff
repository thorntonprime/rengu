Title: When Crying
---
Flower-bloom mornings, moonlit evenings, rainy nights --
  these are the times you long for your lover, people say.
I too have cried much during such quiet times.

But then, I cry even more when people gather to talk and laugh.
Those with lovers try to comfort me with kind words,
  but such consolations sound like mockery.
At such times, I choke back the tears and make them flow down inside.
