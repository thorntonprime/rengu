Title: Everything Transfigured
---
The icon of St. Elias, which jack Ford brought me from St. Meinrad's,
and which yesterday I put up on the east wall of my hermitage. Fabulously
beautiful and delicate and strong. A great red transparent globe of light,
with angelic horses rearing in unison, and angels lifting it all up to
the blackness of the divine mystery -- from, below, the dark curve and
shelves of the mountain from which Eliseus reaches into the globe to
touch the mantle of the prophet, who stands in a little, finely drawn,
very simple Russian peasant’s cart (in the globe of fire!).

Below, Elias sleeps： that was before, when he had sorrow. The angel
leans over him and mentions the hearth-cake to the sleeping prophet.

What a thing to have by you! It changes everything! Transfiguring
everything!

Outside the door, a double bloom on one large violet iris, standing out of
the green spears of the daylilies. And on the tongue of one bloom walks
a great black-gold bee, the largest honeybee I ever saw. To be part of
all this is to be infinitely rich.
