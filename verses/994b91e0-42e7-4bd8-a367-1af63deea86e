One fasts for health's sake under laws governing health, fasts as a penance
for a wrong done and felt as such. In these fasts, the fasting one need
not believe in ahimsa. There is, however, a fast which every votary of
non-violence sometimes feels impelled to undertake by way of protest
against some wrong done by society and this he does when he as a votary
of ahimsa has no other remedy left.
