From the first God created two worlds, the visible and the invisible,
and has made a king to reign over the visible who bears within himself
the characteristic features of both worlds -- one in his visible half
and the other in his invisible half -- in his soul and his body. Two
suns shine in these worlds, one visible and another intellectual. In
the visible world of the senses there is the sun, and in the invisible
world of the intellect there is God, Who is and is called the sun of
truth. The physical world and everything in it is illumined by the
physical and visible sun; but the world of the intellect and those who
are in it are illumined and enlightened by the sun of truth in the
intellect. Moreover, physical things are illumined by the physical
sun, and things of the intellect by the sun of the intellect
separately from one another, for they are not mixed with or merged
into one another -- neither the physical with the intellectual nor the
intellectual with the physical.
