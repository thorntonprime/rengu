Camoes, alone, of all the lyric race,
Born in the angry morning of disaster,
Can look a common soldier in the face：
I find a comrade where I sought a master：
For daily, while the stinking crocodiles
Glide from the mangroves on the swampy shore,
He shares my awning of the dhow, he smiles,
And tells me that he lived it all before.
Through fire and shipwreck, pestilence and loss,
Led by the ignis fatuus of duty
To a dog’s death -- yet of his sorrows king --
He shouldered high his voluntary Cross,
Wrestled his hardships into forms of beauty,
And taught his gorgon destinies to sing.
