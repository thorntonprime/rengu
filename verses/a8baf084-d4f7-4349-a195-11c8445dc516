Laotse has said： ‘Thirty spokes are grouped around the hub of a wheel, and
when they lose their own individuality, we have a functioning cart. We knead
clay into a vessel and when the clay loses its own existence we have a usable
utensil. We make a hole in the wall to make windows and doors, and when the
windows and doors lose their own existence, we have a house to live in.’ And
so when we view a stone cave or a blessed spot and see the vertically uprising
peaks, horizontally-stretching mountain passes, those that go up and form a
precipice, those that go down and form a river, those that are level and form
a plateau, those that are inclined and form a hillside, those that stretch
across and become bridges, and those that come together and become ravines, we
realize that, however incomparably manifold they are in their greatness and
mystery, this mystery and grandeur arises when the parts lose their individual
existence. For when they lose their own existence, there are no passes, no
precipices, no rivers and no plateaux, hillsides, bridges and ravines. But it
is exactly in their non-existence that the special talent in our breast and
the special vision below our eyebrows wander and float at ease. And since this
special talent in our breast and this special vision below our eyebrows can
wander and float at ease only when these things are non-existent, why, then,
must we insist on going to the stone cave and to the blessed spot?
