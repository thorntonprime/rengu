Title: Freshness
---
When it's cold and raining,
you are more beautiful,
and the snow brings me
even closer to your lips.

The inner secret,
that which was never born,
you are that freshness,
and I am with you now.

I cannot explain
the goings and the comings.
You enter suddenly,
and I am nowhere again,
inside the majesty.
