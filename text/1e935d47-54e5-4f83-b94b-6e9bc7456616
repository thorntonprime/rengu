“Could you help me with this?” an ant said to an elephant when a
large seed the ant was dragging back to its nest got stuck between
some grass.

The elephant, looking down and feeling kindhearted that day, began
to contemplate all that might be needed to render some service,

but the task just seemed too delicate and in need of more precision
than the elephant’s trunk or one of his feet or even his tail or one
of his grand ears could handle effectively.

So the elephant began to pray for divine intervention, and sure
enough it worked, or it seemed to --

a berry on a nearby bush happened to fall in such a way as to free
the seed for its onward destination.

The elephant’s faith in God was increased, and the ant, having heard
the prayer, was now less of an agnostic, which he had been for the
last year or so because of personal reasons… he would rather keep
private.

All in all, seems things are moving ahead, working out for the best.
Yep.
