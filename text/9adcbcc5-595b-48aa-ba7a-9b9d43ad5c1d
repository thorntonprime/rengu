Ways are followed, but the eternal way is unfollowable.
Words are spoken, but the eternal word is unspeakable.

Unspoken, it is the origin of the universe.
Spoken it is the mother of all things.

When unspoken it seems obscured.
When spoken it seems manifest.

These are spoken of as different things,
But together their meaning is mysterious.

Mysterious within mysterious,
In all things they are the transcendent door.
