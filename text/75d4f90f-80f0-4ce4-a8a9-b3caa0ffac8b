Everything is virtuous in its nature that fulfils the purpose for
which it was ordained： and the better it does this, the more virtuous
it is; therefore we call him a good man who leads the contemplative or
the active life for which his nature fits him： we call the horse good
that runs fast and far, which he is created to do; we call the sword
good that cuts hard things with ease, for which end it is made. Thus
language, being ordained to express human conceptions, is good when it
does this： and the more perfectly it does it the better it is.
