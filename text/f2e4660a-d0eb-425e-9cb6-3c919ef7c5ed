Now it may be asked, ‘How can a man be without appetites and enjoyment so
long as he is in this present state? I am hungry, and 1 eat; I am thirsty, I
drink; I am weary, I sleep; I am cold, I warm myself; and I cannot possibly
find that to be bitter nor barren of natural enjoyment which is the
satisfaction of my natural desires. This I cannot alter, so long as nature is
nature.’ True; but this pleasure, ease, satisfaction, enjoyment, or delight,
must not penetrate into the depths of thy heart, nor make up a portion of thy
inner life. It must pass away with the things that caused it. and have no
abiding place in thee. We must not set our affections thereon, but allow it
to come and go, and not repose upon the sense of possession with content or
delight in the world or the creature.
