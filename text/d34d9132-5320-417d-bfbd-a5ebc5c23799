All other sacrifices that we make, whether of worldly goods, honours,
or pleasures, are but small matters compared to that sacrifice and
destruction of all selfishness, as well spiritual as natural, that
must be made before our regeneration hath its perfect work. There is a
denial of our own will and certain degrees even of self-denying
virtues which yet give no disturbance to this selfishness. To be
humble, mortified, devout, patient in a certain degree, and to be
persecuted for our virtues is no hurt to this selfishness; nay,
spiritual-self must have all these virtues to subsist upon and his
life consists in seeing, knowing, and feeling the bulk, strength, and
reality of them. But still in all this show and glitter of virtue
there is an unpurified bottom on which they stand; there is a
selfishness which can no more enter into the Kingdom of Heaven than
the grossness of flesh and blood can enter into it.
