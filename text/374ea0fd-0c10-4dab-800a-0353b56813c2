In Thy good pleasure is our peace. The body by its own weight strives
towards its own place. Weight makes not downward only, but to his own
place. Fire tends upward, a stone downward. They are urged by their
own weight, they seek their own places. Oil poured below water, is
raised above the water; water poured upon oil, sinks below the oil.
They are urged by their own weights to seek their own places. When out
of their order, they are restless; restored to order, they are at
rest. My weight, is my love; thereby am I borne, whithersoever I am
borne.
