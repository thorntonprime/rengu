Commentary: \[Unification of mankind] was attempted by the people of
  Babel. The whole passage cited here runs counter to the illusion of
  human equality and the dream of human utopias.

Is it they (the worldly-minded) who apportion the mercy of thy Lord?
It is We who apportion among them their livelihood in the life of the
world, and We raise some of them above others in rank, so that some
may take labour from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is better than
what they amass.

And were it not that mankind would have become one nation, We might
well have appointed for the houses of those who disbelieve in the
Beneficent, roofs of silver and (silver) stairs on which to mount,

And for their houses, (silver) doors, and couches on which to recline,

And ornaments of gold. Yet all that would have been but provision for
the life of the world. And the Hereafter with thy Lord is for the
God-fearing.
