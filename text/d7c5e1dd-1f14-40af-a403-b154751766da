This whole world the illusion-maker (mâyin) projects out of this (Brahma).

And in it by illusion (mâyâ) the other (the individual soul) is confined.

Now, one should know that nature (prakriti) is illusion (mâyâ).

And that the Mighty Lord (mahesvara) is the illusion-maker (mâyin).

This whole world is pervaded

With beings that are parts of Him.
