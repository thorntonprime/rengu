We must know that we can have two kinds of happiness in this life,
according to two different ways, one good, one best, which lead us
thereto; one is the active life, and the other the contemplative. The
latter (although by the active life, as has been said, we may attain
to great happiness) leads us to the highest felicity and blessedness,
as the Philosopher proves in the tenth of the Ethics.
