Title: Like on That Last Ditty
Description: January 16
---
In every line I have left a gold coin, an emerald,

a bone still with some meat on it, or a key to a place you want to
enter.

If you ever read something of mine and think, I just donâ€™t get it,

maybe your brain is having an off day. It is not my fault ...

I double-checked -- many times -- everything I have ever written ...
even if I say otherwise, like on that last ditty.

Be like the one who digs if need be, trusting that I am not fooling
around.

Something of great worth in my pocket wants to be in yours.
