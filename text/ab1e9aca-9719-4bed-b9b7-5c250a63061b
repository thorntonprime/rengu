‘Only for my service have I manifested thee. If I reveal the secret of this,
it is for my intercourse; and if I approach thee, it is for my companionship.
I have not manifested thee to continue in that which veils thee from Me,
nor have I built thee and fashioned thee to advance and recede in that
which divides thee from my intercourse.’
