Much that may one day be possible can already be prepared by the
solitary individual, and built with his own hands which make fewer
mistakes. Therefore love your solitude and bear the pain of it without
self-pity. The distance you feel from those around you should trouble
you no more than your distance from the farthest stars. Be glad that
you are growing, and realize that you cannot take anyone with you; be
gentle with those who stay behind. Be confident and calm before them,
and don't torment them with your doubts or distress them with your
ambitions which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Find in a true
and simple way what you have in common with them, which does not need
to change when you yourself change and change again. When you see
them, love life in a form that is not your own, and be kind to all the
people who are afraid of their aloneness.
