‘Woman and gold’ alone is mâyâ. If mâyâ is once recognized, it feels ashamed
of itself and takes to flight. A man put on a tiger skin and tried to
frighten another man. But the latter said： ‘Ah! I have recognized you! You
are our Haré.’ At that the man in the skin went away smiling to frighten
someone else.
