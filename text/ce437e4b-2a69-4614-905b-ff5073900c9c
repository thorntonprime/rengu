Think, dear sir, of the world you carry within you ... be it
remembrance of your own childhood or longing for your own future. Only
be attentive to what is arising in you, and prize it above all that
you perceive around you. What happens most deeply inside you is worthy
of your whole love. Work with that and don't waste too much time and
courage explaining it to other people.
