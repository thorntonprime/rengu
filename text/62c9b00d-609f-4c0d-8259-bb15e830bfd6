It is comparatively easy to meditate on ‘Aham Brahma asmi\ when you
are seated in a fixed posture, alone in a room; but it is very, very
difficult to retain this thought in a crowd and when the body is in
motion. If you meditate for an hour feeling that you are Brahman and
during the other twenty-three hours of the day think that you are the
body, your sâdhanâ will not produce the desired results.
