Now if anyone says of me, Gotama the Pilgrim, knower and seer as
aforesaid, that my eminent Aryan gnosis and insight have no superhuman
quality, and that I teach a Law that has been beaten out by reasoning,
experimentally thought out and self-expressed, if he will not recant,
not repent and abandon this view, he falls into hell.
