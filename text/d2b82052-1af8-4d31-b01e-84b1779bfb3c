Every good man, in whom religion rules, is at peace and unity with himself, is
as a city compacted together. Grace doth more and more reduce all the faculties
of the soul into a perfect subjection and subordination to itself. The union
and conjunction of the soul with God, that primitive unity, is that which is
the alone original and fountain of all peace, and the centre of rest.
