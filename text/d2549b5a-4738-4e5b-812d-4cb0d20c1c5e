Title: Listen to this Music
Description: January 1
---
I am a hole in a flute that the Christ’s breath moves through --
listen to this music.

I am the concert from the movement of every creature singing in myriad
chords.

And every dancer, their foot I know and lift.

And every brush and hand, well, that is me too, who caresses any
canvas or cheek.

How did I become all these things, and beyond all things?

It was my destiny, as it is yours. My poems are about our glorious
journey.

We are a hole in a flute, a moment in space, that the Christ’s body
can move through and sway

all forms -- in an exquisite dance -- as the wind in a forest.
