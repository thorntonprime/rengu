Title: The Tender Mouth of the Earth
Description: December 28
---
What will the burial of my body be? The pouring of a sacred cup of
wine into the earthâ€™s

tender mouth and making my dear sweet lover laugh one more time.

What is the passing of a body? The glorious lifting of the spirit into
the sacred arms of the

Sky, and making existence smile, one more, one more time.
