And as the Devil would fain deceive all men, and draw them to himself
and his works, and make them like himself, and useth much art and
cunning to this end, so is it also with this false Light; and as no
one may turn the Evil Spirit from his own way. so no one can turn this
deceived and deceitful Light from its errors. And the cause thereof
is. that both these two, the Devil and Nature, vainly think that they
are not deceived, and that it standeth quite well with them. And this
is the very worst and most mischievous delusion.
