Do not let there be a schism in the Order, for a schism in the Order
is a serious matter, Devadatta. He who splits an Order that is united
sets up demerit that endures for an aeon and he is boiled in hell for
an aeon. But he who unites an Order that is split sets up sublime
merit and rejoices in heaven for an aeon.
