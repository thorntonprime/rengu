Since there is no connection between the (mere) sound and the true
meaning, ... a wise man must resort to a good master, for without him
the truth cannot be found even in millions of ages So good men who
desire their own perfection always pay with their whole being full
honour to their master, who is the bestower of infinite rewards. They
abandon envy and malignancy, and pride and self-conceit, their
determination set on enlightenment and the concept of weariness
renounced, and thus they always honour their guru, master of the
world, who bestows success in all things Thereby they gain by the
grace of their guru and without any obstruction that truth supreme
which is taught by all the Buddhas. It is eternal, resplendent and
pure, the abode of the conquerors, the divine substance in all things
and the source of all things. Just as a sun-stone shines brightly from
the proximity of the sun-light which dispels the enclosing darkness,
even so does the jewel of a pupilâ€™s mind, freed from the murkiness of
impurity, light up from the proximity of a world-teacher who is bright
with the fire of the practice of truth.
