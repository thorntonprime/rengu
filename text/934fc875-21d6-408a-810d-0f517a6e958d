The Eternal Religion, the religion of the rishis, has been in
existence from time out of mind and will exist eternally. There exist
in this San√¢tana Dharma all forms of worship -- worship of God with
form and worship of the Impersonal Deity as well. It contains all
paths -- the path of knowledge, the path of devotion, and so on. Other
forms of religion, the modern cults, will remain for a few days and
then disappear.
