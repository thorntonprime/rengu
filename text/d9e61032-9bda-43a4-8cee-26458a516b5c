Suppose that gold belonging to a man on his travels
Had fallen into a place full of stinking dirt.
As it is indestructible by nature, it would stay there
For many hundreds of years.

A deity, with a pure heavenly eye, would see it there,
And say to people：
‘When I have cleansed this gold, the most precious substance of all,
I will bring it back to its precious state.’
