Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen. ...

Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
appear. ...

He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he
condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by
faith.
