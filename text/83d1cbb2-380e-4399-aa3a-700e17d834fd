(The) Guru simply helps you in the eradication of ignorance. Does he
hand over Realisation to you? ... The ego is a very powerful elephant
and cannot be brought under control by anyone less than a lion, who is
no other than the Guru in this instance; whose very look makes the
elephant tremble and die.
