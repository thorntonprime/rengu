The ignorant man, attached to his body, is controlled by the
impressions and tendencies created by his past deeds, and is bound by
the law of karma. But the wise man, his desires being quenched, is not
affected by deeds. He is beyond the law of karma. Since his mind rests
in the Atman he is not affected by the conditions which surround him,
though he may continue to live in the body and though his senses may
move amongst sense objects. For he has realized the vanity of all
objects, and in multiplicity sees one infinite Lord. He is like to a
man who has awakened from sleep and learned that his dream was a
dream.
