Magic makes a straw a mountain by artifice： again, it weaves a mountain like a
straw.

It makes ugly things beautiful by means of sleight; it makes beautiful things
ugly by means of opinion.

The work of magic is this, that it breathes and at every breath transforms
realities.

At one time it shows a man in the guise of an ass. at another time it makes an
ass look like a man and a notable.

Such a magician is within you and latent： truly, there is a concealed magic in
temptation (exerted by the fleshly soul)：

But in the world in which are these magic arts, there are magicians who defeat
sorcery.

In the plain where this fresh poison grew, there has also grown the antidote. O
son.  The antidote says to you. ‘Seek from me a shield, for I am nearer than
the poison to thee.

Her (the fleshly soul's) words are magic and thy ruin; my words are lawful
magic and the counter-charm to her magic.'
