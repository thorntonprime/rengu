If the Mercury is not properly prepared, the gold remains common gold,
being joined with an improper agent; it continues unchanged, and no
degree of heat will help it to put off its corporeal nature. Without
our Mercury the seed (i.e., gold) cannot be sown; and if gold is not
sown in its proper element, it cannot be quickened any more than the
corn which the West Indians keep underground, in air-tight stone jars,
can germinate.
