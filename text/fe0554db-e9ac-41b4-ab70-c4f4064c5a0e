Title: Maybe One Like a Water Buffalo
Description: May 30
---
Your soul could have chosen a different kind of body, one that was not nearly
  as fragile,

one maybe like a water buffalo, more suited to fender benders, lawsuits and
  corporate fights.

Actually it tried that, your soul, being other things, but then decided that a
  form like yours

was the best jumping-offspot, a springboard you could say,

for your final somersault ... into the Beyond.
