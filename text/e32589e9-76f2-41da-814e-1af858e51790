Hermes says that spirits cannot enter bodies unless they are purified,
and then they enter only through the instrumentality of water.
Arisotle says： ‘I do not believe that metals can be transmuted unless
they are reduced to prime matter, that is, purified of their own
corruption by roasting in the fire.’
