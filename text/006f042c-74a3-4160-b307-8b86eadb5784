  - Life-Love=Charity=Love of the Neighbour
By: Peter Sterry
---
Love thy Neighbour as thy self. Love thy Neighbour in thy Jesus, thy God. Love
thy Jesus, thy God, in thy Neighbour. Let this Neighbourhood of Divine Love be
as large as the God of Love himself is. Let every other Person and Spirit,
which lives and moves, and hath its being in God, within the encompassing, upon
the Ground and Root of the Divine Being, be thy Neighbour, thy Brother, another
self, as thy self to thy self, the Object to thee of an heavenly and
incorruptible Love.
