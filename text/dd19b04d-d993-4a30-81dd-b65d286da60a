While the Soul is wholly intent upon the Glory of God in Prayer, many
sweet Appearances, high Truths shew themselves clearly to the Soul,
which were before Unthought of. or very difficult. They now appear,
as in their Element, like Stars to him that looks stedfastly on a
clear Skie in an Evening. They come forth, as out of their
Bride-Chamber, ready Trim’d. prepar’d for the Soul ... often they
come thick and swarming about the Soul ... ： like Bees out of a
Hive. A Man frequently learns more and better at one Hour’s Prayer,
than in the Study of many days.
