Title: The Body a Tree
Description: February 12
---
The body a tree, God a wind.

When He moves me like this, like this,

angels bump heads with each other gathering beneath my cheeks,

holding their wine barrels, catching the brilliant tear, pearl rain.

Love, a tree. When it moves us like this. How can our soulâ€™s limbs not
touch?
