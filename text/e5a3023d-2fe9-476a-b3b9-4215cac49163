God acts within every moment
  and creates the world with each breath.
He speaks from the center of the universe,
  in the silence beyond all thought.
Mightier than the crash of a thunderstorm,
  mightier than the roar of the sea,
is God's voice silently speaking
  in the depths of the listening heart.
