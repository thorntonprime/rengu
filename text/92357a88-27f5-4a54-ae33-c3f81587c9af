In that conjunction of the two sexes, or, to speak more truly, that fusion of
them into one, which may be rightly named Eros, or Aphrodite, or both at once,
there is a deeper meaning than man can comprehend. It is a truth to be accepted
as sure and evident above all other truths, that by God, the Master of all
generative power, has been devised and bestowed upon all creatures this
sacrament of eternal reproduction, with all the affection, all the joy and
gladness, all the yearning and the heavenly love that are inherent in its
being.
