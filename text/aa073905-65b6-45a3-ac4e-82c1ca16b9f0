Theologians speak of hell. I will tell you what hell is. It is merely
a state. Your state here is your eternal state. This is hell. Take an
illustration. A thief who has incurred the penalty of death on being
caught： picture his state of mind seeing others happy! So do we feel,
and worse. And so with those in hell who see God and his friends： the
height of torment, so the masters say.
