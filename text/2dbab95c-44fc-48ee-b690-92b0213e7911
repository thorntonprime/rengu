Title: In the Midnight of Thy Tresses
Description: April 2
---
Who can fully renounce a day? Who can conceive of forgiving a whole
life, granting all in it a pardon,

unless at midnight you let us enter your tresses, know your scent,
become as intimate with your light as anyone ever has.

All images are shadows you did cast. They will gladly surrender their
identity and reveal their

potential the way a piece of paper would if it ever made love to a
great flame
