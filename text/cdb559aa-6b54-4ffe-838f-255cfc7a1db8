Music expresses the harmony of the universe, while rituals express the order of
the universe. Through harmony all things are influenced, and through order all
things have a proper place. Music rises from heaven, while rituals are
patterned on the earth. To go beyond these patterns would result in violence
and disorder. In order to have the proper rituals and music, we must understand
the principles of Heaven and Earth.
