Know that the word ‘Unicity’ (al-wâhidiyah) denotes the following revelation
of the Essence： the Essence appears as Quality and the Quality as Essence, so
that under this aspect, each Divine Quality appears as the essential
determination (al-'ayn) of each of the others. Thus for example, the Avenger
(al-muntaqim) here is God Himself, and God is the Avenger; on the other hand,
the Avenger here is the Beneficent (al-mun'im) Himself.  Similarly, Unicity
manifests Itself in grace (an-ni'mah) and manifests essentially in vengeance.
Grace, which is an aspect of mercy (ar-rahmah), thus appears as the essence
even of vengeance, which itself is an aspect of chastisement; and on the
other hand vengeance, which is nothing other than chastisement, appears as an
aspect of grace which is identified with mercy. All this is by virtue of the
appearance of the Essence in the Qualities and in their effects.
