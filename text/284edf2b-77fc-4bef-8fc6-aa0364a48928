Each knows his allotted grade and seeks it as a child seeks its
motherâ€™s breast, and iron, the lodestone. To occupy or even to aspire
to a higher grade is impossible. In the grade in which he is placed
each sees the realisation of his highest hopes. He loves his own grade
passionately and cannot conceive that a higher could exist. If it were
not so, heaven would not be heaven but a mansion of grief and bitter
disillusion.  Nevertheless, those in the superior participate in the
enjoyment of the lower grades.
