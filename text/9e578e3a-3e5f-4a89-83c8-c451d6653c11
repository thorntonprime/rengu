Knower of the Unseen, He revealeth unto none His secret.

Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a
guard to go before him and a guard behind him

That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their
Lord. He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all
things.
