Title: When the Sun Conceived a Man
Description: February 25
---
What could Hafiz utter about that day when the Sun conceived a man,
gave birth to itself as reality and truth?

What could all the speech in creation ever say about that resplendent
morning when the eternal Handsome One let his face and body reappear
by grace in form?

There is something I have seen in the interior of Muhammad that is the
luminous root of all in existence, independent of space and timeâ€™s
novice dance across a single lute string of the infinite.

I carry gifts today from the kings of fish, beasts, birds, and angels.
I carry gifts today from rivers, seas, fields, stars, and from every
soul, from every soul that will ever be.

God, let us know what you first saw that made you want to do this,
create a human heart so in need.

Let us know, Beloved, that there is only Light.
