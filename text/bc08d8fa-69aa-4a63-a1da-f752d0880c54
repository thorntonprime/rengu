For this I say： if, looking in thy Heart.
Thou for Self-whole mistake thy Shadow-part,
That Shadow-part indeed into The Sun
Shall melt, but senseless of its Union：
But in that Mirror if with purged eyes
Thy Shadow Thou for Shadow recognize
Then shalt Thou back into thy Centre fall
A conscious Ray of that eternal All.
