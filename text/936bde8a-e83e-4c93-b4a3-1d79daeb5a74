Commentary:
  Body: According to the editor in his Introduction to the
    Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, we have in this passage 'the most
    ancient authority at present known to us for the view which connects
    the tribe of Dan with Antichrist, and helps to explain the exclusion
    of this tribe from the list of the Twelve in the N.T. Apocalypse.'
  Commentary: The Testaments is another text of highly disputed
    origins, so Perry's reference to it is questionable. Most
    scholars consider it a forgery, or else a document that has
    been substantially modified by Christians using Jewish source
    material.

And whensoever ye depart from the Lord, ye shall walk in all evil and
work the abominations of the Gentiles, going a-whoring after women of
the lawless ones, while with all wickedness the spirits of wickedness
work in you. For I have read in the book of Enoch, the righteous, that
your prince is Satan, and that all the spirits of wickedness and pride
will conspire to attend constantly on the sons of Levi, to cause them
to sin before the Lord.
