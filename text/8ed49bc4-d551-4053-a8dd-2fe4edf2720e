We suppress nothing at all in man： Neither intelligence, nor wit. nor art：
for all these come from the divine wisdom. By no means do we suppress the
Word pronounced by the wisdom formed in God. but only the Beast who wants to
hold sway over the divine contemplativeness, that is to say, the bestial will
of egoism and individualism, which has strayed from God and which honours its
own self like a false god.
