The contemplating Intellect, the first or highest, has self-disposal
to the point that its operation is utterly independent： it turns
wholly upon itself： its very action is itself; at rest in its good it
is without need, complete, and may be said to live to its will： there
the will is intellection： it is called will because it expresses the
Intellectual-Principle in the willing-phase and, besides, what we know
as will imitates this operation taking place within the
Intellectual-Principle. Will strives towards the good which the act of
Intellectual-Principle realizes. Thus that principle holds what will
seeks, that good whose attainment makes will identical with
Intellection.
