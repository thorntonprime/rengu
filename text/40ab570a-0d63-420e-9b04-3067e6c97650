Love does not mind that place
where it camped for a while in a physical form
or where that body may come to rest,

and may even then be revered if that body
became a unique shelter and nourishment for
others.

That is what greatness doesï¼š kindly leaves
a shelter for us to gather under, where more
nourishment can be offered to all things.
