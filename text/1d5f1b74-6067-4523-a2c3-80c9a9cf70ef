  Hence, yoga is the antithesis of 'quietism'. Yoga aims to control the
  obstacles to grace, and not -- as is often contended -- the 'gift of
  grace' itself.

Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Chitta) from taking various forms
(Vrittis). ...  Control is by practice and non-attachment. ... That effect
which comes to those who have given up their thirst after objects either seen
or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. That is
extreme non-attachment which gives up even the qualities, and comes from the
knowledge of Purusha.
