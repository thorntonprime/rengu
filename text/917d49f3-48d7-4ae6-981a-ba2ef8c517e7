Title: So You Can Plant More Wheat
Description: January 2
---
I would like to remove some rocks from your field so that you can
plant more wheat.

And those hills I see that are part of you, I have some trees in mind
for them

and flowering grasses, so that you wonâ€™t erode when the elements pour.

Are we not lovers? Cannot I speak to you like this?

Do I need to ask your permission to hitch up my ox and sing to him as
I improve your vast terrain?

The title to your heart came to my office. In looking at it a great
interest in your soul developed. The care of your soul became mine.

So I would like to remove some stones from your meadows; then an
orchard you could grow,

and the world, and the world then, will come to taste your riches.
