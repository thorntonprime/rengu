Would you know the perfect Master? It is he who understands the
regulation of the fire, and its degrees. Nothing will prove to you so
formidable an impediment as ignorance of the regimen of heat and fire;
for our whole Art may be looked upon as being concentrated in this one
thing, seeing it is all important for the proper development of our
substance that the degree of heat which is brought to bear on it
should be neither too great nor too small.  In regard to this point
many learned men have gone grievously astray.
