St Dionysius says： ‘God is nothing,’ and this is also implied by St Augustine
when he says： ‘God is everything,’ meaning： nothing is God’s. So that by
saying ‘God is nothing’ Dionysius signifies that there is no thing in his
presence. It follows that the spirit must advance beyond things and
thingliness, shape and shapenness, existence and existences; then will dawn in
it the actuality of happiness which is the essential possession of the actual
intellect.
