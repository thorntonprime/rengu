Then woe that day unto the deniers
Who play in talk of grave matters;
The day when they are thrust with a disdainful thrust, into the fire
  of hell：
This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny.
Is this magic, or do ye not see?
Endure the heat thereof, and whether ye are patient of it or impatient
of it is all one
  for you. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do.
