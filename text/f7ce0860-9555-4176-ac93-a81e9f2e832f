External conditions such as occupation and environment do not in any
way hamper the progress of the soul towards its eternal source, if the
urge within is strong enough to lead us to the goal.

It does not matter whether one is a prince, a millionaire or a
labourer. What is needed is intense aspiration for the Divine.
