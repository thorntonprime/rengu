All whatever is spoken, written, or taught of God, without the
knowledge of the signature is dumb and void of understanding; for it
proceeds only from an historical conjecture, from the mouth of
another, wherein the spirit without knowledge is dumb; but if the
spirit opens to him the signature, then he understands the speech of
another. ... For though I see one to speak, teach, preach, and write
of God, and though I hear and read the same, yet this is not
sufficient for me to understand him; but if his sound and spirit out
of his signature and similitude enter into my own similitude, and
imprint his similitude into mine, then I may understand him really and
fundamentally, be it either spoken or written, if he has the hammer
that can strike my bell.

By this we know, that all human properties proceed from one; that they
all have but one only root and mother; otherwise one man could not
understand another. ...

Man has indeed all the forms of all the three worlds lying in him; for
he is a complete image of God, or of the Being of all beings.
