Hearken： God is infinite and without end, but the soul’s desire is an abyss
which cannot be filled except by a Good which is infinite; and the more
ardently the soul longeth after God, the more she wills to long after Him;
for God is a Good without drawback, and a well of living water without
bottom, and the soul is made in the image of God, and therefore it is created
to know and love God.
