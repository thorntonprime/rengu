We ought not to question whence It comes; there is no whence, no
coming or going in placeï¼š It either appears or does not appear. We
must not run after It. but we must fit ourselves for the vision and
then wait tranquilly for it as the eye waits on the rising of the sun
which in its own time appears above the horizon and gives itself to
our sight.
