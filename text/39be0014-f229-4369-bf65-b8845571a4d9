This treasure of God’s kingdom is hidden by time and multiplicity by
the soul’s own activity and by her creaturehood. The more the soul
departs from all this multiplicity the more God’s kingdom is revealed
in her. But the soul is not able for this without the help of grace.
An she find it, it is grace that has aided her thereto, for grace is
innate in her highest prototype. There the soul is God. using and
enjoying all things God-fashion.
