The practice of samâdhi is like that of shooting. An inexperienced
archer will at first practise shooting at a large target, next a small
one. and finally hit the bull's-eye. He will train himself to hit an
object by making it smaller and smaller, first a coin, then a stick,
then a few hairs, then a single hair, then a tenth, a hundredth and
finally a thousandth of a hair. Thus having increased in skill, he
will be able, as quick as thought, to hit a thing, no matter how
small, so that even if he only heard the voice of a man or an animal
sounding in the dark, he would be able at once to locate it and hit it
without fail.
