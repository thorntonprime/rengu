Title: It Cuts the Plow Reins (2)
---
It will allow you to befriend life and light and sanity and not even
mind waking to another day.

It reveals the excitement of the present and the beauty of precision.

It confers vitality and a sublime clarity until finally

all the heart can do is burst open with great love and cheer!

O purity, O dear truth and friend within me, why didnâ€™t you tell me
sooner you could do all this --

cut the reins of illusion, so we can all just go wild, loving God and
everyone all day!
