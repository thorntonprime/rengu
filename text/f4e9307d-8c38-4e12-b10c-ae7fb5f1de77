Title: Maybe Even Illegal?
Description: March 11
---
Whenever you, God, want to be near me, you are. Moreover, you can even
be more me than I am, and this, this you always choose.

Something does not seem right here, something seems unjust and maybe
even illegal?

I don’t want to have to sic a good lawyer on you, but I think I have a
valid case： I mean, why can’t I be with you the way you are with me?

It is not that I want any kind of power or control over your domain
that a union with you would bring.

It is just your beauty I so miss, and the way it makes me alive, feel
so alive and at home. Home.
