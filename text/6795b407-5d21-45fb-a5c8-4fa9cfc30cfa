Thou hast learned a trade to earn a livelihood for the body： (now)
set thy hand to a religious (spiritual) trade.

In this world thou hast become clothed and rich： when thou comest
forth from here, how wilt thou do?

Learn such a trade that hereafter the earning of God’s forgiveness may
come in as revenue (to thee). ...

The earnings of religion are love and inward rapture -- capacity to
receive the Light of God, O thou obstinate one!

This vile fleshly soul desires thee to earn that which passeth away：
how long wilt thou earn what is vile? Let it go! Enough!

If the vile fleshly soul desire thee to earn what is noble, there is
some trick and plot behind it.
