Title: I Wish I Could Speak Like Music
Description: December 12
---
I wish I could speak like music. I wish I could put the swaying
splendor of fields into words so that

you could hold Truth against your body and dance. I am trying the best
I can with this crude brush,

the tongue, to cover you with light. I wish I could speak like divine
music. I want to give you the

sublime rhythms of this earth and the sky’s limbs as they joyously
spin and surrender, surrender

against God’s luminous breath. Hafiz wants you to hold me against your
precious body and dance, dance.
