If you enter the life of dreams. O Soul, do not place your happiness in it,
nor in the spectacle it exhibits to you, and do not suppose that it is real;
else, when you wake, you will be a laughing-stock.

The world of things that come to be and cease to be is a world of dreams. He
who is asleep and dreaming (in the literal sense) in this world is in reality
dreaming doubly; and when he wakes (in the literal sense), he is like a man
who has been awakened from an ‘incidental’ sleep, but has given himself up
again to his ‘natural’ sleep.
