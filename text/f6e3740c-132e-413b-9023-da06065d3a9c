To the Master it may appear easy enough： but to the beginner it must
seem at first very hard and uphill work. He should not. however,
despair, for in due time he will receive the reward of his diligence
and aspiration： even in the dangers which the knowledge may bring
upon him. he will be kept from harm by the loving hand of Providence,
as I can testify from personal experience. We have with us God's Ark
of the Covenant, which contains the most precious of earthly things,
and is guarded by the holy Angel of the Lord.
