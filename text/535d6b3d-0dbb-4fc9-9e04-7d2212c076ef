It is permissible to take lifeâ€™s blessings with both hands provided thou dost
know thyself prepared in the opposite event to take them just as gladly. This
applies to food and friends and kindred, to anything God gives and takes
away. ... As long as God is satisfied do thou rest content. If he is pleased
to want something else of thee, still rest content.
