Gasan instructed his adherents one dayï¼š "Those who speak against
killing and who desire to spare the lives of all conscious
beings are right. It is good to protect even animals and
insects. But what about those persons who kill time, what about
those who are destroying wealth, and those who destroy political
economy? We should not overlook them. Furthermore, what of the
one who preaches without enlightenment? He is killing Buddhism."
