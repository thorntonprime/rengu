If you wish to work properly, you should never lose sight of two great
principles： first, a profound respect for the work undertaken, and
second, a complete indifference to its fruits.  Thus only can you work
with the proper attitude. This is called the secret of Karma-Yoga.
And you can overcome all aversion for a piece of work, if you but
consider it as belonging to God.
