Title: An Infant in Your Arms
Description: February 7
---
The tide of my love has risen so high, let me flood over you.

Close your eyes for a moment and maybe all your fears and fantasies
will end.

If that happened God would become an infant in your arms

and then you would have to nurse all creation
