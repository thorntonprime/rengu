O Abu Sa'id, endeavour to remove self-interest (tama') from thy
dealings with God. So long as that exists, sincerity (ikhlâs) cannot
be attained. Devotions inspired by self-interest are work done for
wages, but devotions inspired by sincerity are work done to serve
God. ...

Perfect love proceeds from the lover who hopes naught for himself：

What is there to desire in that which has a price?

Certainly the Giver is better for you than the gift：

How should you want the gift, when you possess the very Philosopher’s
Stone?
