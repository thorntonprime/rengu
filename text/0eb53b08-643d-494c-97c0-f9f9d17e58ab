Mention is made of two classes of yogis; the hidden and the known.
Those who have renounced the world are ‘known’ yogis; all recognize
them. But the ‘hidden’ yogis live in the world. They are not known.
They are like the maidservant who performs her duties in the house
but whose mind is fixed on her children in the country. They are
also ...  like the loose woman who performs her household duties
zealously but whose mind constantly dwells on her lover.
