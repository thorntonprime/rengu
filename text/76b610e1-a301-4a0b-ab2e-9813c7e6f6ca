Title: Inherent Suffering
Description: January 11
---
Inherent in most suffering, especially that of the mind or heart,

is feeling, is believing that you can miss something in life.

But that is not true. For on your wedding day with the Sun,

one of His presents to you will be -- if you want it -- every
experience that has ever been known or can be known.

Yes, a divine treasury awaits each soul. It is the INFINITE, infinite
possibilities, that

you can really borrow from at any moment, right now.
