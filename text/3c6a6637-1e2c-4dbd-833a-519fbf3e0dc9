Title: Bump Heads with the Roof
Description: June 13
---
“How can I grow and reach my full height?” a tree once said to me.

And I replied, “Dear, sit quiet for a minute each day, don’t let your branches
  move,

conserve your energy within and without, concentrate all your strength on your
  invisible wings.

Then a fuel that feeds your actions and thoughts will help your spirit

to rise and bump heads with the Roof over all.”
