Title: For a Single Tear
Description: May 11

I know of beauty that no one has ever known.

But how could that be possible when I may seem so new in infinite time?

It is because God belongs to only you! Did you hear that? Did you hear what
  Hafiz just said?

God belongs to only you! That is the only reasonable payment for a single tear.
