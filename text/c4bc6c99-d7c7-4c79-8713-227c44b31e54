It is quite true that in your common, tinkering Medicinal Art, which
seeks to counteract only the separate symptoms or manifestations of
disease, there is no room for an Universal Medicine. But the true
physician knows that all disease (whatever shape it may assume) is
simply a depression of the vital spirits, and that whatever
strengthens vitality, will cut off the possibility of disease at the
very source, expelling the humours which each produce their own
peculiar malady, and I maintain that our Universal Medicine is a
remedy of this radical kind. It gently promotes and quickens the
movement of the vital spirits, and thus, by renewing the source of
life, renovates and quickens the whole frame, infusing new vitality
and strength into every part. For this reason adepts call it the Great
Mystery of Nature, and the preventive of old age and disease. By its
aid any man may live the full term of days naturally allotted to him.
and need have no fear of contagion, even when the plague, or some
other malignant epidemic, is striking down hundreds of his neighbours.
