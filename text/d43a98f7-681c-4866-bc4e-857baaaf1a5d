‘Abraham trusted in God’ (Gen. XV. 6). To trust in God alone and join
no other with Him is no easy matter, by reason of our kinship with our
yoke-fellow, mortality, which works upon us to keep our trust placed
in riches and repute and office and friends and health and strength
and many other things. To purge away each of these, to distrust
created being, which in itself is wholly unworthy of trust, to trust
in God, and in Him alone, even as He alone is truly worthy of
trust—this is a task for a great and celestial understanding which has
ceased to be ensnared by aught of the things that surround us.
