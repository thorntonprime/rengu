All the scriptures have been written, God has made the world and all
angelic nature in order that God might be born in the soul and the soul
be born into God. All cereal nature means wheat, all metal nature means
gold, all generation means man. As one philosopher observes, ‘We can find
no animal without some likeness to man.’
