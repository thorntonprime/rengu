  This [warning against passions of thought] is important. People who appear
  dispassionate are often riddled with this passion, which predominates in the
  thinking of these times.

Some passions are of the body, others are passions of the soul; some are
passions of lust, others passions of the excitable part, yet others are
passions of thought. Of the latter some are passions of the mind and others
of reasoning. All of them combine with one another in various ways and affect
one another.
