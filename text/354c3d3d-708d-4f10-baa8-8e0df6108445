As physicians speak of a certain disease or madness, called
Hydrophobia, the symptom of those that have been bitten by a mad dog,
which makes them have a monstrous antipathy to water; so all Atheists
are possessed with a certain kind of madness, that may be called
Pneumatophobia, that makes them have an irrational but desperate
abhorrence from spirits or incorporeal substances, they being acted
also, at the same time, with an Hylomania, whereby they madly doat
upon matter, and devoutly worship it as the only Numen.
