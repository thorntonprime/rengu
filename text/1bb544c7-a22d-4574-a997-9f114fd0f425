Title: Riches Everywhere
Description: December 21

Donâ€™t envy my talents, or seek them. For few could bear the suff ering
it took to mine the jewels I have brought to town.

There are divine riches everywhere. The most natural way for most to
find them is by caring for those who are close to you as if they were
our Beloved.
