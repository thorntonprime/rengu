The person who has not, in a moment of firm resolve, accepted -- yes,
even rejoiced in -- what has struck him with terror -- he has never
taken possession of the full, ineffable power of our existence. He
withdraws to the edge; when things play out, he will be neither alive
nor dead.

To discover the unity of dread and bliss, these two faces of the same
divinity (indeed, they reveal themselves as a single face that
presents itself differently according to the way in which we see
it)ï¼š that is the essential meaning and theme of both my books (The
Sonnets to Orpheus and The Duino Elegies).
