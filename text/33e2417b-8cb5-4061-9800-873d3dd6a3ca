Title: The Stairway of Existence
Description: February 16
---
We are not in pursuit of formalities or fake religious laws,

for through the stairway of existence we have come to God’s door.

We are people who need love, because love is the soul’s life, love is
simply creation’s greatest joy.

Through the stairway of existence, O through the stairway of
existence, Hafiz,

have you now come, have we now all come, to the Beloved’s door.
