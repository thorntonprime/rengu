The Emperor of the dolorous realm, from mid breast stood forth out of
the ice; and I in size am liker to a giant,

than the giants are to his armsï¼š mark now how great that whole must
be, which corresponds to such a part.

If he was once as beautiful as he is ugly now, and lifted up his brows
against his Maker, well may all affliction come from him.
