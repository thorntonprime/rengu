One must practise intense spiritual discipline. Can one obtain the
vision of God all of a sudden, without any preparation?

A man asked of me, ‘Why don’t I see God?’ I said to him, as the idea
came to my mind： ‘You want to catch a big fish. First make
arrangements for it. Throw spiced bait into the water. Get a line and
a rod. At the smell of the bait the fish will come from the deep
water.  By the movement of the water you will know that a big fish has
come.’
