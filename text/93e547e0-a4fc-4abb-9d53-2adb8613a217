When my sight descended lower on them, each seemed wondrously
distorted, between the chin and the commencement of the chest：

for the face was turned towards the loins; and they had to come
backward, for to look before them was denied.. ..

Reader, so God grant thee to take profit of thy reading, now think for
thyself how I could keep my visage dry,

when near at hand I saw our image so contorted, that the weeping of
the eyes bathed the hinder parts at their division?3

Certainly I wept, leaning on one of the rocks of the hard cliff, so
that my Escort said to me： ‘Art thou, too, like the other fools?

‘Here pity lives when it is altogether dead. Who more impious than he
that sorrows at God’s judgment?'
