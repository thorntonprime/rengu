All worldly pursuits have but the one unavoidable and inevitable end, which
is sorrow; acquisitions end in dispersion; buildings, in destruction;
meetings, in separation; births, in death. Knowing this, one should, from the
very first, renounce acquisition and heaping-up, and building, and meeting;
and, faithful to the commands of an eminent guru, set about realizing the
Truth.
