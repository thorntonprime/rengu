Title: I Promise
Description: April 6
---
Has not the Architect, Love, built your heart in a glorious manner,

with so much care that it is meant to break if love ever ceases to
know all that happens is perfect?

And where does anything love has ever known go, when your eye and hand
can no longer be warmed by its body?

So vast a room your soul, every universe can fit into it.

Anything you once called beautiful, anything that ever

gave you comfort waits to unite with your arms again. I promise.
