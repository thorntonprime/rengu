Wise the beggar or the thief who can get a coin from my purse,
for it will multiply,
it could turn into emerald worlds.

But what you get from me deeds to be held and not quickly spent.
Some kind of incubation is required.

How can you do that?
If  you slow your mind down
and keep your aim steady on the present
a heat in your gaze will occur,

something you want to see that was hiding in the invisible
will begin to step forward,
and grow.

Instead ood stealing from me,
you should knowï¼š
I like musicians,
and will offer freely to their hat.
