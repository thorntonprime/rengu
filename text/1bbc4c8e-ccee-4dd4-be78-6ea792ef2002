In old times the perfect man of Tao was subtle, penetrating and so profound
that he can hardly be understood ...

  Going back to the origin is called peace;
  It means reversion to destiny.
  Reversion to destiny is called eternity.
  He who knows eternity is called enlightened ...
  Being supreme he can attain Tao.
  He who attains Tao is everlasting.
  Though his body may decay he never perishes.
