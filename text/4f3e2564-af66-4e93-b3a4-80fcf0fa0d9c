By: St Bernard
---
Grace is necessary to salvation, free will equally so -- but grace in
order to give salvation, free will in order to receive it. Therefore
we should not attribute part of the good work to grace and part to
free will; it is performed in its entirety by the common and
inseparable action of both; entirely by grace, entirely by free will,
but springing from the first in the second.
