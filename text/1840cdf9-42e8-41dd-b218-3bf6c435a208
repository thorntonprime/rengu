The mode of teaching through symbols, was considered by Pythagoras as
most necessary. For this form of erudition was cultivated by nearly
all the Greeks, as being most ancient. But it was transcendently
honored by the Egyptians, and adopted by them in the most diversified
manner. Conformably to this, therefore, it will be found, that great
attention was paid to it by Pythagoras, if any one clearly unfolds the
significations and arcane conceptions of the Pythagoric symbols, and
thus develops the great rectitude and truth they contain, and
liberates them from their enigmatic form. For they are adapted
according to a simple and uniform doctrine, to the great geniuses of
these philosophers, and deify in a manner which surpasses human
conception.
