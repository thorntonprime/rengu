May we, the disciples of the Buddha, when we come to die suffer no
mental perversion, nor come under the spell of any hallucination, nor
lose the consciousness of the Truth, but, free from agony of mind and
body, may we in peace of mind, like those in an ecstasy, have that
holy retinue of Amida come to meet us, and, embarking safely on the
ship of his Original Vow, may we have our birth into Amida Buddha’s
Pure Land, and sit upon the lotus of the first rank.
