Beautiful and Blessed is this Will, when its own Bridegroom shines upon it,
and attracts it by beams, by sweet glimpses of it self, spread through all
things, more clear, or more obscure, but true. Then do her beauty and
blessedness both change into deformity and misery, when by hellish
enchantments she is deluded, and drawn into the embraces of a wrinkled Witch,
or a Spirit, from the darkness below, transformed into the likeness of her
heavenly Love.
