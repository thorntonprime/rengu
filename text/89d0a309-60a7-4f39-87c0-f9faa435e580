Flies sit at times on the sweet meats kept exposed for sale in the shop of a
confectioner; but no sooner does a sweeper pass by with a basketful of filth
than the flies leave the sweet meats and sit upon the filth-basket. But the
honey-bee never sits on filthy objects, and always drinks honey from the
flowers. The worldly men are like flies. At times they get a momentary taste
of divine sweetness, but their natural tendency for filth soon brings them
back to the dunghill of the world. The good man, on the other hand, is always
absorbed in the beatific contemplation of divine beauty.
