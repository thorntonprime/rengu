Title: As Fertile as I Am (II)
Description: March 25

And then You are here, the one who sired every world,

flooding my every crevice, every pore, dissolving any wound of
loneliness, satisfying

every desire. ... eternal and ephemeral, eternal and ephemeral.

The divine both soothing, making me present, and tearing me apart, the
way true rapture does. This is what I was really made for.

I will give birth to You now. What else could I possibly care about?

The world will become my attendant if I ever asked for anything.

And now look at all the good I could do if I ever wished.

Yes, we will give birth to You. Listen, Hafiz, to what you just said.
What more could you ever want?
