Description:
  - May 17
  - Written in the sanitarium, in Rilke's final illness
Format: Verse

Brother body is poor ... that means we must be rich for him.
He was often the rich one; so may he be forgiven
for the meanness of his wretched moments.
Then, when he acts as though he barely knows us,
may he be gently reminded of all that has been shared.

Of course, we are not one but two solitaries：
our consciousness and he.
But how much we have to thank each other for,
as friends do! And illness reminds us：
friendship demands a lot.
