Now in the days of Cronos there existed a law respecting the destiny
of man, which has always been, and still continues to be in Heaven, --
that he who has lived all his life injustice and holiness shall go,
when he is dead, to the Islands of the Blessed, and dwell there in
perfect happiness out of the reach of evil; but that he who has lived
unjustly and impiously shall go to the house of vengeance and
punishment, which is called Tartarus.
