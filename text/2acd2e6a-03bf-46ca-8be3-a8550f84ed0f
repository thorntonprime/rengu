Allow your judgments their own undisturbed development, which, like
any unfolding, must come from within and can by nothing be forced or
hastened. Everything is gestation and then birth. To allow each
impression and each embryo of a feeling to complete itself in the
dark, in the unsayable, the not-knowing, beyond the reach of one's own
understanding, and humbly and patiently to await the dawning of a new
clarityï¼š that alone is the way of the artist -- in understanding as in
creating.
