It is impossible for us to study all the Sâstras and learn all that is
laid down in them. ...  Further, as the defects inherent in us are
numberless, it is impossible for us to find out all of them or to seek
to get rid of them by ourselves. A Guru is therefore necessary to know
about our spiritual equipments, to find out the stage in which we are
at present, to decide what course of action will take us to the next
higher stage and to teach and guide us aright. ...  When the áástras
prescribe what courses of action have to be pursued by aspirants in
the several stages, a Guru is necessary to know what the Sástras
prescribe and to teach us the particular course of action suited to
our qualifications.
