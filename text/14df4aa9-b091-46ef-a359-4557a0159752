The apostle (Rom. VI. 14; Phil. III. 8) doth not mean to disparage a
real inward righteousness, and the strict observance of the law; but
his meaning is to show how poor and worthless a thing all outward
observances of the law are in comparison of a true internal conformity
to Christ in the renovation of the mind and soul according to his
image and likeness.
