  - Life-Love=Charity=Love of the Neighbour

By: St Augustine
---
Now Scripture enjoins nothing except charity and condemns nothing except lust,
and in that way informs the practices of men I mean by charity that affection
of the mind which aims at the enjoyment of God for His own sake and of one’s
self and one’s neighbour for God’s sake. By lust I mean that affection of the
mind which aims at the enjoyment of one’s self and one’s neighbour without
reference to God. ... Now in proportion as the dominion of lust is pulled down,
in the same proportion that of charity is built up.
