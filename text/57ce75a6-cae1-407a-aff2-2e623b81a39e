And know, O Soul, that it will not be possible for you, when you depart from
the sense-world, to take with you any knowledge of the world of composite (or
concrete) things, as though such knowledge were (as in truth it is not)
separated (from external things) and joined and mingled with the being of the
soul itself. Grasp then the knowledge of simple things, and abandon knowledge
of composite things.
