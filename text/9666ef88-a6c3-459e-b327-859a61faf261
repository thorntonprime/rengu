The mortal who thinks of his gains or his honours or the favour of
many men will be afraid of death when it falls upon him. Whatsoever it
be in which the pleasure-crazed spirit takes its delight, that thing
becomes a pain a thousand times greater. Therefore the wise man will
seek not for pleasure, for from desire arises terror.
