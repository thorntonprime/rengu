The thought of suffering, humiliation, confusion and poverty is
directly opposed to our natural ideas of happiness, and only by a
miracle of grace can we rejoice in the midst of such evils. But such a
miracle will certainly be wrought in the souls of all who give
themselves up unreservedly to the accomplishment of the Divine will.
The honor of God demands that all who generously devote themselves to
His service shall experience contentment and happiness therein.
