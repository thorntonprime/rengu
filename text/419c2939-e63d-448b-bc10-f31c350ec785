The nature of the mind is such that it becomes what it thinks
intensely upon. For example, if you think of the vices or faults of
other men, you will be charged with these same vices or faults, at
least for the present time. He who knows this psychological law will
never allow himself to censure others or to discover faults in their
conduct. He will see only the good in them. Such is the means of
increasing in concentration, in yoga, and in spirituality.
