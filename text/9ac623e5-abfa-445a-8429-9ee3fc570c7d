My children, mark me. I pray you. Know! God loves my soul so much that his very
life and being depend upon his loving me. whether he would or no. To stop God
loving me would be to rob him of his Godhood; for God is love no less than he
is truth; as he is good, so is he love as well. It is the absolute truth, as
God lives. ...

If anyone should ask me what God is. I should answerï¼š God is love, and so
altogether lovely that creatures all with one accord essay to love his
loveliness, whether they do so knowingly or unbeknownst, in joy or sorrow.
