Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, ‘He who acquires knowledge and does
not act upon it is like a woman who practises immorality in secret,
then becomes pregnant and her pregnancy becomes apparent and she is
covered with shame. Thus shall God (Exalted is He!) cover with shame
on the Day of Resurrection in the sight of witnesses him who does not
act upon his knowledge.’
