Title: Dissolving in the Infinite
---
I have opened all the windows in my house.
Eagles fly in and out, as do any words that
are spoken about me.

Anything my ears might detect, firsthand or
second ... I might give that news a moment's
attention

and then just let it be the tiny evaporating
whiff of smoke it is, dissolving in the Infinite.
