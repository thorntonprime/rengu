We have the Principle of Life in us, for the most part in Sensual Pleasures;
as a piece of Gold in the Dirt; as the Sun in a Cloud; as the Brain or Fancy
in a Mist or Fumes. Wipe the Dirt off the Gold, scatter the Cloud from before
the Sun, the Mist on the Fancy; chase vain Delights out of the Soulï¼š All
these will shine in their proper Beauties.
