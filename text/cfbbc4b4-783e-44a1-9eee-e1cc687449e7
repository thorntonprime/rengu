It is one flash, the being-ready and the pouring-in. Nature reaching
her summit, God dispenses his grace; the instant the spirit is ready
God enters without hesitation or delay. ... Thou needst not seek him
here or there, he is no further off than at the door of thy heart;
there he stands lingering, awaiting whoever is ready to open and let
him in. Thou needst not call to him afar, he waits much more
impatiently than thou for thee to open to him. He longs for thee a
thousandfold more urgently than thou for him; one point the opening
and the entering.
