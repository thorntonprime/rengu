0 Lord, if Thou sendest me to Hell
I raise no protest.
And if Thou takest me to Paradise.
I go there, but not of my own choice.

If in Hell I obtain union with Thee
What care I for those who dwell in Paradise?
And were I called to Heaven without Thee
The pleasures of Paradise would then
Be worse than the fires of Hell.
