So oflt as I with state of present time,
  The image of the antique world compare,
  When as mans age was in his freshest prime,
  And the first blossome of faire vertue bare,
  Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,

  ...

For that which all men then did vertue call,
  Is now cald vice; and that which vice was hight,
  Is now hight vertue, and so vs’d of all：
  Right now is wrong, and wrong that was is right,
  As all things else in time are chaunged quight.
  Ne wonder; for the heauens reuolution
  Is wandred farre from where it first was pight.
  And so doe make contrarie constitution
Of all this lower world, toward his dissolution.
