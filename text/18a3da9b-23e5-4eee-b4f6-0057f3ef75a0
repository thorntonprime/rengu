Suddenly, or even thou knowest, all is away and thou left barren in
the boat, blowing with blundering blasts now hither and now thither,
thou knowest never where nor whither. Yet be not abashed; for he shall
come, I promise thee, full soon, when he liketh, to relieve thee and
doughtily deliver thee of all thy dole, far more worthily than ever he
did before.  Yea! and if he go again, again will he come; and each
time, if thou wilt bear thee by meek suffering, will he come more
worthlier and merrylier than other. And all this he doth because he
will have thee made as pliant to his will ghostly as a Roan glove to
thine hand bodily.
