In order to live a perfect act of love, I offer myself victim in a holocaust to
thy merciful love, entreating thee to consume me without cease, letting my soul
overflow with the waves of infinite tenderness which are within thee, that I
may thus become martyr of thy love. O my God!

May this martyrdom, after having prepared me to appear before thee, then make
me die, and may my soul leap without delay into the eternal embrace of thy
merciful love!

I wish, O my Beloved, with each beat of my heart, to renew this offering for
thee an infinite number of times, until when the shadows retire,' I can reveal
my love to thee in an eternal encounter!
