(God) only is to be sought; for apart from Him all things are nothing.
Possessing only Him, we possess all things, for He is all. Knowing Him we
know all. for He is the Truth of all things. It is His will that the vast
admirable contrivance of the universe should lead us to admiration of
him. ...  But to anyone enquiring in learned ignorance what they are, or how,
or to what purpose, all things must replyï¼š 'We can answer nothing. ... If
thou wouldst know anything concerning us, seek it in our reason and cause,
seek it not in us. There, while thou seekest but one. shalt thou find all
things."
