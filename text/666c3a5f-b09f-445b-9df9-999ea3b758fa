This man who is within Godâ€™s love and ken is none other than what God is
himself.  Loving thyself thou lovest all men as thyself. While thou lovest
anyone less than thine own self thou dost not love thyself in truth; not till
thou lovest all men as thyself, all men in one man who is both God and man. The
man who loves himself and all men as himself is righteous, absolutely just.
