In dense darkness, O Mother, Thy formless beauty sparkles;
Therefore the yogis meditate in a dark mountain cave.
In the lap of boundless dark, on Mahânirvâna’s waves upborne.
Peace flows serene and inexhaustible.
Taking the form of the Void, in the robe of darkness wrapped.
Who art Thou, Mother, seated alone in the shrine of samâdhi?
From the Lotus of Thy fear-scattering Feet flash Thy love’s lightnings;
Thy Spirit-Face shines forth with laughter terrible and loud!
