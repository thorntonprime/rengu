Let me advise you. moreover, not to neglect your fire, or move or open
the vessel, or slacken the process of decoction, until you find that
the quantity of the liquid begins to diminish： if this happens after
thirty days, rejoice, and know that you are on the right road.  Then
be doubly careful, and you will, at the end of another fortnight, find
that the earth has become quite dry and of a deep black. This is the
death of the compound： the winds have ceased, and there is a great
calm. This is that great simultaneous eclipse of the Sun and Moon,
when the Sea also has disappeared. Our Chaos is then ready, from
which, at the bidding of God. all the wonders of the world may
successively emerge.
