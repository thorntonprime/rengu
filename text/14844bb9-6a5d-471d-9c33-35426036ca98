Just as, monks, the mighty ocean consorts not with a dead body; for
when a dead body is found in the mighty ocean it quickly wafts it
ashore, throws it up on the shore; even so, monks, whatsoever person
is immoral, of a wicked nature, impure, of suspicious behaviour, of
covert deeds, one who is no recluse though claiming to be such, one
who is no liver of the Brahma-life though claiming to be such, one
rotten within, full of lusts, a rubbish-heap Heterod. of filth, --
with such the Order consorts not, but gathering together quickly
throws him out.  Though, monks, he be seated in the midst of the
Order, yet is he far away from the Order; far away is the Order from
him.
