There is no greater victory in the life of a human being than victory
over the mind. He who has controlled the gusts of passion that arise
within him and the violent actions that proceed therefrom is the real
hero. All the disturbances in the physical plane are due to chaos and
confusion existing in the mind. Therefore to conquer the mind through
the awareness of the great Truth that pervades all existence is the
key to real success and the consequent harmony and peace in the
individual and in the world. ... The true soldier is he who fights not
the external but the internal foes.
