God hath said： ‘Kings, when they enter a city, ruin it’. When gnosis
is established in the heart of the gnostic, the empire of doubt and
scepticism and agnosticism is utterly destroyed, and the sovereignty
of gnosis subdues his senses and passions so that in all his looks and
acts and words he remains within the circle of its authority.
