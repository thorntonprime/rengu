Commentary: The other [four] requisites are (1) the right Mercury, (2) a
  well-regulated fire, (3) the right proportion of water to fire, (4)
  a properly-sealed vessel.

The fifth requisite in our work is patience. You must not yield to
despondency, or attempt to hasten the chemical process of dissolution. ...
You need the patience of the husbandman, who, after committing the
seed to the earth, does not disturb the soil every day to see whether
it is growing.
