Of all this suffering and abandonment the man should make art inward joy; and
he should give himself into the hands of God, and should be glad because he
is able to suffer for the glory of God. And if he be true to this
disposition, he shall taste such an inward joy as he never tasted before; for
nothing is more joyful to the lover of God, than to feel that he belongs
wholly to his Beloved.
