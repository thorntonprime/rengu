There is no meaning in changing the Mantra according to our whims. If
we with all faith and devotion repeat the Mantra given by our Guru,
that Mantra will take us to the summit of God-realisation. What needs
to be done is that we should make our heart perfectly pure so that
God’s love and power may be revealed in us. This can be achieved only
by the Guru’s grace and repetition of His Mantra.
