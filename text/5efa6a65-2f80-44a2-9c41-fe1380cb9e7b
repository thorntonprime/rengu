What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! Once, while at Vrindâvan, he
felt thirsty and went to a well. Near it he saw a man standing. On
being asked to draw a little water for him. the man said： ‘I belong
to a low caste, sir. You are a brâhmin. How can I draw water for you?’
Krishnakishore said： ‘Take the name of Siva. By repeating His holy
name you will make yourself pure.’ The low-caste man did as he was
told, and Krishnakishore, orthodox brâhmin that he was, drank that
water. What tremendous faith!
