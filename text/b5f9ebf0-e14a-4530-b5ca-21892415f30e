Title: THe Earth's Silhouettes
---
What plant can grow if you keep lifting it
from the soil?

Let your roots expand unchecked into a vista,
a forest, a river, a song, or some verse you can
hold tenderly.

You need to become quiet for this, as roots
work in silence beneath the earth's silhouettes.

Let all your senses extract from me what
they can. So mineral-rich I am,

having drawn all a soul could from what
is above, below and to the side, and within us,
within us my love.
