Now art thou in the ghostly sea. shipping over from bodilyness into
ghostliness.

Many great storms and temptations, peradventure. shall rise in this
time, and thou knowest never whither to run for sorrow. All is away
from thy feeling, common grace and special. Be not over-much afraid,
then, although thou have matter, as thou thinkest. but have a lovely
trust in our Lord, so little as thou mayest get for the time, for he
is not far.
