See, in all mortal bequests, the heritage becomes the property of the
living, whilst it slips from the dying; whereas in the case of one who
bequeaths unto his children the inheritance of religious knowledge,
wisdom, and the Holy Law, the possession, while being transmitted to
his children, is not altogether alienated from him after death.
