But for those who have received no commission to govern other men, but
stand in a private character without office, it is needful that they
secretly judge themselves inwardly, and beware of judging all things
without, for in such judgments we do commonly err, and the true
position of things is generally very far otherwise from that which it
appears to us, as we often come to discover afterwards. On this point
remember the proverb： ‘He is a wise man who can turn all things to
the best.’
