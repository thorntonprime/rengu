Title: Why You Stare at the Mountain
Description: January 20
---
What does real love do? It stills the longing, for real love is
crowned, and then all become its willing slave.

Love creates a home wherever it is. Love is really never in want. True
love is always in a state of found.

Homeless one is, whenever the heart is not alive. Realizing that, I
sing the way I do. A bird’s melody can grant a pardon to vision that
is obstructed.

I know why you stare at the mountain’s beauty, for she reminds you of
something vital in your self. And natural desires to explore her
heights are just there to help your reach your own summit.

Once, while I was looking at the sky, it spoke, saying, “Hafiz, I am
surprised at your admiration for me, for dear you are my root. With a
ruby in your purse why wish to hold a clay coin?”

I like this poem, its weave. It is a basket where something has been
placed for you. Read this again, slowly, it may become more revealed.

A problem has arisen. I can’t leave right now, you feel too close. Do
you mind if we kiss for an hour?
