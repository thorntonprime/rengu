Title: Behold Your Self
---
Like a great film or play everyone should see,
BEHOLD THYSELF.

Hints of your beauty the mountains have.
The enchanting complexions of the coral reefs
are pale to a golden candle in our heart.

What moves in any ocean moves through us.
A thousand kinds of music play every hour
that you orchestrate.

Let the next ticket you buy help seat you in
front of ... your soul.
