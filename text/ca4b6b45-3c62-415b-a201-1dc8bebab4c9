The ascetic said, ‘... If you wish to see one who is more ascetic than I,
climb this mountain.’ Dhu ’1-Nûn went up the mountain and saw a young man
seated in a cell; one of his feet, which he had cut off, was lying outside
and worms were eating it.  ‘One day,’ he said in answer to Dhu ’1-Nûn’s
question, ‘I was sitting in this cell, when a woman passed by.  My heart
inclined to her and my body urged me to follow her. I put one foot outside. I
heard a voice saying, “After having served and obeyed God for thirty years,
art not thou ashamed to obey the Devil now?” Thereupon I cut off the foot
which I had set outside, and I am waiting here to see what will happen to me.
Why have you come to a sinner like me?  If you wish to see a man of God, go
to the top of the mountain.’
