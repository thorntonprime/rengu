  - Person: Kuo Jo-hsü
    Description: An authority on painting of the Sung period.

People think that men alone have spirit; they do not realize that everything is
inspirited. Therefore Kuo Jo-hsü despised deeply the works of common men. He
said that though they were called paintings, they were not painting (as art),
because they transmit only the forms but not the spirit. Consequently the
manner of painting which gives the resonance of the spirit and the movement of
life is the foremost. And Kuo Jo-hsü said that it has been practised only by
high officials and hermit scholars, which is correct.
