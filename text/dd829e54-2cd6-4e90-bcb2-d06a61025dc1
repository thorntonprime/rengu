First Gaoler. Come, sir, are you ready for death?

Posthumus. Over roasted rather; ready long ago. ...

First Gaol. Look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.

Post. Yes, indeed do I, fellow. ... I tell thee ... there are none
want eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as wink and will
not use them. ...

First Gaol. Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
gibbets. I never saw one so prone.
