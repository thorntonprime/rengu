Title: The Joys of Travel
Description: April 18

Oh, the joys of travel! To feel the excitement of sudden departure,
not always knowing whither. Surely you and I are in agreement about
that. How often did my life seem concentrated in that single moment of
departure. To travel far, far -- and that first morning's awakening under
a new sky! And to find oneself in it -- no, to discover more of oneself
there. To experience there, too, where one has never been before,
one's own continuity of being and, at the same time, to feel that
something in your heart, somehow indigenous to this new land, is
coming to life from the moment of your arrival. You feel your blood
infused with some new intelligence, wondrously nourished by things you
had no way of knowing.
