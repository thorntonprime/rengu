Retreat (khalwa) is like a smithâ€™s forge in which, by the fire of
austerity.1 the desire becomes fused, purified, delicate and gleaming
like a mirror and in it appeareth the form of the Invisible. For every
morning of the retreat, a veil should lift and the retreatant find
himself drawing ever nearer to God. so that in forty mornings, the
forty-fold veil should be lifted and the purified human nature should
return from a land that is far-off to the land of proximity.
