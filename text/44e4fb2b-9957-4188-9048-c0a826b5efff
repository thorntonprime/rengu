The teacher is he who knows the Eternal Wisdom, the Veda, who is
devoted to the All-Pervader Vishnu, who knows not arrogance, who knows
the method of yoga, ever stands upon yoga and has become yoga itself;
who is pure, who is devoted to his teachers and who has witnessed the
Supreme Person, Purusha. He who possesses all these virtues is called
a ‘dispeller of darkness’, a guru.

The syllable ‘gu’ means darkness, the syllable ‘ru’ means dispeller：
he is therefore called a ‘guru’ because he dispels darkness.

The guru is the Supreme Cause, the guru is the ultimate destiny, the
guru is transcendent sapience, the guru is the supreme resort, the
guru is the final limit, the guru is the supreme wealth. Because he
teaches ‘That’ (the Supreme Essence) the guru is most great.
