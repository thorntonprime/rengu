Now, spiritual eating is by the mouth of desire, and desire is nothing else
but will and hunger. ... If you have many wills and many hungers, all that
you eat is only the food of so many spiritual diseases, and burdens your soul
with a complication of inward distempers. And under this working of so many
wills it is that religious people have no more good or health and strength
from the true religion than a man who has a complication of bodily distempers
has from the most healthful food. For no will or hunger, Sin be it turned
which way it will or seem ever so small or trifling, is without its effect.
