By: Peter Martyr
Commentary: >
  One of the first fruits of Renaissance man’s new conception of the world,
  the conception which enabled him to breach the Pillars of Hercules, was
  the mass extermination of the Indians of Central America. Not the least
  ironical aspect of all this is that Columbus, himself a lofty idealist,
  was in search among other things of the Terrestrial Paradise itself.

It is certain that the land among these people (the Indians of Hispaniola) is
as common as the sun and water; and that ‘mine and thine.’ the seeds of all
mischief, have no place with them. They are content with so little that, in so
large a country, they have rather superfluity than scarceness; so that they
seem to live in a golden world, without toil, in open gardens, neither
intrenched, nor shut up by walls or hedges. They deal truly with one another,
without laws or books or judges.
