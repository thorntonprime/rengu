The soul and body of Christ and His divine nature were so inseparably
joined together that they cannot be severed throughout all eternity.
Nevertheless Christ had to die, and His soul had to be separated from
His body, and once more joined to it on the third day, that His body
might be glorified, and rendered as subtle as His soul and spirit.
