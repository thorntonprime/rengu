In vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are
mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called
by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?

In deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest
of the world ...  attribute their uselessness to the fault of those
who will not use them, and not to themselves. ... The ruler who is
good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him;
although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp;
they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true
helmsmen to those who are called by them the good-for-nothings and
star-gazers.
