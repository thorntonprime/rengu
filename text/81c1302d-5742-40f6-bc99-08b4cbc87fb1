It is only when it is visualized how brief a thing human life is, and
how negligible in duration, when compared with the immensity of Time
and yet how important the self is as part of the Supreme Self, in
following the way of enjoined duty, and how all engaged in a common
pilgrimage have obligations to help everyone else, that a proper sense
of values will be gained, and happiness or misery will be understood
as temporary and fleeting, when compared with the ultimate joy
(ànanda) that awaits every soul. The blazing of the path to this goal
is the function of Dharmasàstra.
