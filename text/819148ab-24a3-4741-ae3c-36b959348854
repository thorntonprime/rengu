The earth is a great distilling vessel, formed by the hand of an all wise
Creator, on the model of which all Sages have constructed their small
distilling vessels; and if it pleased God to extinguish the central fire, or to
destroy the cunning machinery, this universal frame would relapse into chaos.
At the end of time. He will kindle the Central Fire into a brighter flame, will
cause all the water to evaporate, will calcine the earth -- and thus the earth
and the water will be rendered more subtle and pure, and will form a new and
more glorious earth.
