By ‘men who sin knowingly' Scripture means them that are weak in the
exercised knowledge and performance of Good; and by ‘them that know
the Divine Will and do it not', it means them that have heard the
truth and yet are weak in faith to trust the Good or in action to
fulfil it. And some desire not to have understanding in order that
they may do good, so great is the warping or the weakness of their
will. And. in a word, evil (as we have often said) is weakness,
impotence, and deficiency of knowledge (or, at least, of exercised
knowledge), or of faith, desire, or activity as touching the Good.
