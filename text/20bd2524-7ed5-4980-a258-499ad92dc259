Title: NEver Be Less Furry
Description: March 5
---
I thought God might be willing to listen to reason, so I worked up a
proposal that outlined some of my many concerns.

My primary objective in that twenty page thesis of sheer elegance,
that I was hoping might impress Him, could be distilled into this one,
a bit long-winded hoot：

That you—God—would never be any less furry, and always as accessible
and loving as my cat; and like her, sleep with your head on my

shoulder. And, of course, don’t forget the purrrrrrrrr!
