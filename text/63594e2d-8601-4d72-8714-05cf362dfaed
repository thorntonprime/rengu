The Image of God is the most perfect creature. Since there cannot be two Gods
the utmost endeavour of Almighty Power is the Image of God. It is no blasphemy
to say that God cannot make a God：the greatest thing that He can make is
His Image：a most perfect creature, to enjoy the most perfect treasures, in
the most perfect manner. A creature endued with the most divine and perfect
powers：... able to see all eternity with all its Center objects, and as a
mirror to contain all that it seeth：able to love all it contains, and as a
Sun to shine upon its loves.
