It's not enough to open up
There's got to be something to see
The falling sun is folding up
Sometimes it falls right through me
And I've had enough of lonliness
There's got to be something for me
And all I know is when it's time to go,
Running always comes easy to me

Till I found you, I walk a little lighter now
And I've got you, to smile a little brighter now
This is all new, I feel a little younger now
Because of you, everything is right

I fell into your lovely sunset
It fell on me and now I'm drowning
I want you to be my lunar night light
Surrounding me in post black twilight

Because I found you, I walk a little lighter now
And I've got you, to smile a little brighter now
This is all new, I feel a little younger now
Because of you, everything is right

It was torture waiting for so long
But I know now that there's nothing wrong
With waiting, knowing some day I would find my song

And I found you...
