You must understand that all creatures are by nature endeavouring to
be like God. The heavens would not revolve unless they followed on the
track of God or of his likeness. If God were not in all things, nature
would stop dead, not working and not wanting; for whether thou like it
or no, whether thou know it or not, nature fundamentally is seeking,
though obscurely, and tending towards God. No man in his extremity of
thirst but would refuse the proffered draught in which there was no
God. Natureâ€™s quarry is not meat or drink nor clothes nor comfort nor
any things at all wherein is naught of God, but covertly she seeks and
ever more hotly she pursues the trail of God therein.
