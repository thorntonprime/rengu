There is a warfare where evil spirits secretly battle with the soul by
means of thoughts.  Since the soul is invisible, these malicious
powers attack and fight it invisibly, in accordance with its nature.
And it is possible to see on both sides weapons and plans (disposition
of armies and military strategy), deceptive artifices and intimidating
attacks (impetuous charges aiming at intimidation), and hand to hand
battles; and victories and defeats on both sides. The only thing
lacking in this mental warfare we describe, as compared with physical
warfare, is a definite moment of declaration of war. In physical
warfare it is customary to establish a time and to conform to certain
rules. But mental warfare starts suddenly, without any declaration,
with an onslaught directed at the very depths of the heart.
