Arjuna said： But, O Descendant of Vrishni (Krishna), impelled by what power
does a man commit sin even against his wish, constrained, as it were, by
force?

The Blessed Lord said： It is desire, it is anger, born of Rajo-Guna (quality
of passion)： of unappeasable craving and of great sin; know this as the foe
in this world.  As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an
embryo by the womb, so is this (Self) covered by that.
