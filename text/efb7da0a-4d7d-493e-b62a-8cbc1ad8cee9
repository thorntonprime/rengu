Thus, Ânanda, on name and form depends consciousness;

On consciousness depend name and form;
On name and form depends contact;
On contact depends sensation;
On sensation depends desire;
On desire depends attachment;
On attachment depends existence;
On existence depends birth;
On birth depend old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and
despair.

Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise.
