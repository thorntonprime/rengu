It is very difficult to separate with a knife the kernel of a coconut
from the shell before the milk inside has dried up. When the milk
dries up, the kernel rattles inside the shell. At that time it loosens
itself from the shell. Then the fruit is called a dry coconut. The
sign of a manâ€™s having realized God is that he has become like a dry
coconut. He has become utterly free from the consciousness that he is
the body.
