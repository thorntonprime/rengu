Let (the student of our Art) carry on his operations with great
secrecy in order that no scornful or scurrilous person may know of
them; for nothing discourages the beginner so much as the mockery,
taunts, and well-meant advice of foolish outsiders. Moreover, if he
does not succeed, secrecy will save him from derision; if he does
succeed, it will safeguard him against the persecution of greedy and
cruel tyrants.
