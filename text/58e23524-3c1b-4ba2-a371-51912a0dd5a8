To attain tranquillity of spirit and avoid inconstancy, one must have
initiation and the aid of a guide. The spiritual path is the most
dreadful there is; it is strewn with innumerable pitfalls. Unless he
is guided by an experienced hand, a man no matter how intelligent is
sure to make some false moves. ...

In this world, even to learn the art of stealing one needs a guru. How
much greater is the necessity of a guru if one is to acquire the
supreme knowledge of Brahman!
