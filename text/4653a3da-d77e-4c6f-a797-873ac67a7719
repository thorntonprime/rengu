Are you looking for me? I am in the next seat.
My shoulder is against yours.
You will not find me in stupas, not in Indian shrine rooms,
  nor in synogogues, nor in cathedrals：
not in masses, nor kirtans, not in legs winding around your
  own neck, nor in eating only vegetables.
When you really look for me, you will see me instantly --
you will find me in the tiniest house of time.
Kabir says： Student, tell me, what is God?
He is the breath inside the breath.
