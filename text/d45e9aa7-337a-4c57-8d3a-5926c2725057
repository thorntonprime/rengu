The artist (or musician) we may think of as exceedingly quick to beauty, drawn
in a very rapture to it. ... All that offends against unison or harmony repels
him： he longs for measure and shapely pattern. This natural tendency must be
made the starting-point： after the tone, rhythm and design in things of sense
he must learn to distinguish the material forms from the Authentic Existent
which is the source of the entire reasoned scheme of the work of art; he must
be led to the Beauty that manifests itself through these forms; he must be
shown that what ravished him was no other than the harmony of the Intellectual
World and the Beauty in that sphere -- not some one shape of beauty but the
All-Beauty, the Absolute Beauty; and the truths of philosophy must be implanted
in him to lead him to faith in that which, all unknowing, he holds within
himself. ... His lesson must be to fall down no longer in bewildered delight
before some one embodied form; he must be led, under a system of mental
discipline, to beauty everywhere and be made to discern the One Principle
underlying all.
