Though God be everywhere present, yet He is only present to thee in
the deepest and most central part of thy soul. ... This depth is
called the centre, the fund or bottom of the soul. ... Awake, then,
thou that sleepest, and Christ, who from all eternity has been
espoused to thy soul, shall give thee light. Begin to search and dig
in thine own field for this pearl of eternity that lies hidden in it;
it cannot cost thee too much, nor canst thou buy it too dear, for it
is all; and when thou hast found it thou wilt know that all which thou
hast sold or given away for it is as mere a nothing as a bubble upon
the water.
