Title: Since I've Learned to be Silent
Description: March 22
---
Since I've learned to be silent, everything has come so much closer to
me. I am thinking of a summer on the Baltic when I was a childï¼š how
talkative I was to sea and forest; how, filled with an unaccustomed
exuberance, I tried to leap over all limits with the hasty excitement
of my words. And how, as I had to take my leave on a morning in
September, I saw that we never give utterance to what is final and
most blessed, and that all my rhapsodic Table d'hote conversations did
not approach either my inchoate feelings or the ocean's eternal
self-revelation.
