Title: The Apple Orchard (II)
Description: June 8
Format: Verse

The trees, like those of DÃ¼rer,
bear the weight of a hundred days of labor
in their heavy, ripening fruit.
They serve with endless patience to teach

how even that which exceeds all measure
must be taken up and given away,
as we, through long years,
quietly grow toward the one thing we can be.
