The Human Soul ... participates in the Divine Nature, after the manner
of an eternal Intelligence; for the soul is ennobled and denuded of
matter by that Sovereign Power in proportion as the Divine Light of
Truth shines into it, as into an Angel; and Man is therefore called by
the Philosophers the Divine Animal.
