They are all too few who are fully ripe for gazing in Godâ€™s magic
mirror. Precious few succeed in living the contemplative life at all
here upon earth. Many begin, but fail to consummate it. Because they
have not rightly lived the life of Martha.  As the eagle spurns its
young that cannot gaze at the sun, even so fares it with the spiritual
child.

He who would build high must lay firm and strong foundations.
