Title: To Trust Our Sadness
Description: February 21

Consider whether great changes have not happened deep inside your
being in times when you were sad. The only sadnesses that are
unhealthy and dangerous are those we carry around in public in order
to drown them out. Like illnesses that are treated superficially, they
only recede for a while and then break out more severely. Untreated
they gather strength inside us and become the rejected, lost, and
unloved life that we may die of. If only we could see a little farther
than our knowledge reaches and a little beyond the borders of our
intuition, we might perhaps bear our sorrows more trustingly than we
do our joys. For they are the moments when something new enters us,
something unknown. Our feelings grow mute in shy embarrassment, they
take a step back, a stillness arises, and the new thing, which no one
knows, stands in the midst of it all and says nothing.
