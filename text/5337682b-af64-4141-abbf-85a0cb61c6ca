Holofernes. Satis quod sufficit.

Sir Nathaniel. I praise God for you, sir： your reasons at dinner have been
sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection,
audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without
heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king’s, who is
intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

Hol. Novi hominem tanquam te： his humour is lofty, his discourse peremptory,
his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too
affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

Nath. A most singular and choice epithet.

(Draws out his table-book.)

Hol. He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his
argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and point-devise
companions; such rackers of orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say, doubt; det, when he should pronounce, debt,—d, e, b, t, not d, e, t： he
clepeth a calf, cauf; half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebour, neigh abbreviated
ne. This is abhominable, which he would call abominable.—it insinuateth me of
insanie： anne intelligis, domine? To make frantic, lunatic.

Nath. Laus Deo bone intelligo.

Hol. Bone? bone, for bene： Priscian a little scratched; ’twill serve.
