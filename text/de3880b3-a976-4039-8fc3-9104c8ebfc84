Seek the inner depth of things, and when they lead you to the edge of a great
discovery, discern whether it arises from a necessity of your being. Either
this discovery will strike you as superficial and you will shed it, or it will
reveal itself as intrinsic to you and grow into a strong and honest tool of
your art.
