Commentary: |
  This passage, like several others (particularly the Taoist texts)
  cited in the same chapter, really refers to Pure Being, at the center
  of all worldsï¼š but its doctrinal sense can be restricted to our
  particular state, since the center of the human state is essentially
  identical, within the limits imposed by its particular conditions, to
  the center of all states, being on the One and same Axis (spirit,
  breath, thread.' solar ray) that links all worlds together.

The Good, Asclepius. must be a thing that is devoid of all movement
and all becoming, and has a motionless activity that is centred in
itself; a thing that lacks nothing, and is not assailed by
perturbations; a thing that is wholly filled with abundance of all
that is desired.  Everything that furnishes any sort of supply is
called good; but the Good is the one thing which is the source of all
things, and supplies all things at all times.
