God has created the world in play, as it were. This is called Mahâmâyâ, the
Great Illusion. Therefore one must take refuge in the Divine Mother, the Cosmic
Power Itself. It is She who has bound us with the shackles of illusion. The
realization of God is possible only when those shackles are severed. ...

In northwest India the bride holds a knife in her hand at the time of marriage：
in Bengal, a nut-cutter. The meaning is that the bridegroom, with the help of
the bride, who is the embodiment of the Divine Power, will sever the bondage of
illusion.
