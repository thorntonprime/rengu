Thus, there is sensual eating and wise eating. When the body composed of the
four elements suffers the pangs of hunger and accordingly you provide it with
food, but without greed, that is called wise eating. On the other hand, if
you gluttonously delight in purity and flavour, you are permitting the
distinctions which arise from wrong thinking.  Merely seeking to gratify the
organ of taste without realizing when you have taken enough is called sensual
eating.
