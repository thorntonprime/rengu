How delicious it is to wake up in a place where no one, no one in the
world, guesses where you are. Sometimes I have stopped spontaneously
in towns along my way only to taste the delight that no living being
can imagine me there. How much that added to the lightness of my soul!

I remember certain days in Cordova where I lived as if transparent,
because I was completely unknown. The sweetness of staying in a little
Spanish town, if only to relate to certain dogs and a blind
beggar -- more dangerous, that blind man, because he can read you. But
three days later, if he hears you come back toward his church at the
same hour, he counts you now as someone who henceforth exists, and he
incorporates you into his world of sound.

And there you are, destined to new birth, mystical and nocturnal.
