Title: About Being More Secure
Description: December 19
---
They touch us, don’t they? So many things in diff erent ways. And then
those feelings can last for years in varying degrees.

Are not our days and hours our response to what we have felt?

We circle inside what we love, what we fear, what we hope.

The mind is like a falcon, ever ready with its sight on its choice
prey—beauty. For nothing satisfies like Her taste.

A holy infant, taken from God’s womb, is each creature.

What happened to your royal attendant? Who allowed you to crawl to
places that can give you the feeling, at times, of dread?

This poem was longer by some 20 lines, but I let them go back to where
they came from, some shop in the ethers.

There’s enough here to contemplate, as is. My humming is winding down.
My favorite season of love has approached ... quiet.

Most live before dawn and become overwhelmed with the frightening
noises, ideas, in your house and mind.

You know what I mean, about being more secure with the light on.
