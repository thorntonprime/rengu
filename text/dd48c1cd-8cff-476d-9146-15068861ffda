What is willing in the Godhead? It is the Father watching the play of his own
nature.  What is this play? It is his eternal Son. There has always been this
play going on in the Father-nature. Play and audience are the same. ... As it is
written in the Book of Wisdom, ’Prior to creatures, in the eternal now, I have
played before the Father in his eternal stillness.’ The Son has eternally been
playing before the Father as the Father has before his Son. The playing of the
twain is the Holy Ghost in whom they both disport themselves and he disports
himself in both. Sport and players are the same. Their nature proceeding in
itself. ‘God is a fountain flowing into itself,’ as St Dionysius says.
