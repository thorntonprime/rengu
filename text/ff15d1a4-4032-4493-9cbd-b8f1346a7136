The soul is a miraculous abyss of infinite abysses, an undrainable ocean,
an inexhausted fountain of endless oceans, when it will exert itself to fill
and fathom them. For if it were otherwise man is a creature of such noble
principles and severe expectations, that could he perceive the least defect
to be in the Deity, it would infinitely displease him.
