No other foes have life so long as the beginningless. endless,
everlasting life of my enemies the Passions. All beings may be turned
by submission to kindness： but these Passions become all the more
vexatious by my submission. ... Then I will not lay down my burden
until these foes be smitten before my eyes. ...

Ah. when I vowed to deliver all beings within the bounds of space in
its ten points from the Passions. I myself had not won deliverance
from the Passions. Knowing not my own measure. I spoke like a madman.
Then I will never turn back from smiting the Passions. 1 will grapple
with them, will wrathfully make war on them all except the passion
that makes for the destruction of the Passions.
