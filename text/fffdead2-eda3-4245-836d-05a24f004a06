It is a short lesson, that thou ever praise God, and with a true, not false
heart say, ‘I will bless the Lord at all times： his praise shall be always
in my mouth.’ It is a short lesson： it is, namely, that thou know that He
giveth of His mercy, when He giveth; that He taketh away of His mercy, when
He taketh away; and that thou must not believe that thou art abandoned by the
mercy of Him who either comforteth thee by giving, lest thou fail, or
punisheth thee when thou art uplifted, lest thou perish. Praise Him
therefore, whether in His gifts or in His scourges. The praise of the
scourges is the medicine for the wound.
