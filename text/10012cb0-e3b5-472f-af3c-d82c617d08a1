Beauty is ours if we belong to God;
From outside let it stream into the heart.
What comes from God must lead us back to Him;
The beautiful is not of worldly art.

If you see Truth in Beauty, all is well;
Unselfish is the love that makes us wise.
To see the pleasure only, leads to hell;
Love God, then Beauty leads to Paradise.

The earthly good reveals the Good as such;
First see the Essence, and the form will shine.
In love of Truth there is a hidden death;
So die in God before you drink the wine.
