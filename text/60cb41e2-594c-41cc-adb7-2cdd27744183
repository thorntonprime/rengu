Commentary: Traditional teaching envisages the possibility of apes
  \‘issuing’ from man, never the inverse. It is noteworthy that certain
  scientists adopt the same attitude; cf.  Douglas Dewar and L. M.
  Davies, in The Nineteenth Century and After, April, 1943, pp. 167-173.
  While on this subject, a correspondence might be pointed out between
  the ‘doctrine’ of evolution and a key formula of the Black Mass： ‘And
  the flesh was made Word’.

And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto
them： Be ye apes, despised!

And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations,
and an admonition to the God-fearing.
