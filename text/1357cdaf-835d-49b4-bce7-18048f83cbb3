Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord
which thou lettest down?

Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a
thorn?

Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words
unto thee?

Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant
for ever?

Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy
maidens?

Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among
the merchants?

Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish
spears?

Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
