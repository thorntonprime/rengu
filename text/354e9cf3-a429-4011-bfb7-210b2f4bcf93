  mother, St Monica.
By: St Augustine

If to any the tumult of the flesh were hushed, hushed the images of earth, and
waters, and air, hushed also the poles of heaven, yea the very soul be hushed
to herself, and by not thinking on self surmount self, hushed all dreams and
imaginary revelations, every tongue and every sign, and whatsoever exists only
in transition, since if any could hear, all these say, We made not ourselves,
but He made us that abideth for ever -- If then having uttered this, they too
should be hushed, having roused only our ears to Him who made them, and He
alone speak, not by them, but by Himself, that we may hear His Word, not
through any tongue of flesh, nor Angel’s voice, nor sound of thunder, nor in
the dark, riddle of a similitude, but, might hear Whom in these things we
love, might hear His Very Self without these, (as we two now strained
ourselves, and in swift thought touched on that Eternal Wisdom, which abideth
over all;) -- could this be continued on, and other visions of kind far unlike
be withdrawn, and this one ravish, and absorb, and wrap up its beholder amid
these inward joys, so that life might be for ever like that one moment of
understanding which now we sighed after; were not this, Enter into thy
Master’s joy?
