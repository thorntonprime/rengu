O! mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities：
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain’d from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse：
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
And vice sometime's by action dignified
