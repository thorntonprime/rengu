That Christian in whom religion rules powerfully, is not so low in his
ambitions as to pursue any of the things of this world as his ultimate
end： his soul is too big for earthly designs and interests; but
understanding himself to come from God, he is continually returning to
him again. It is not worthy of the mind of man to pursue any
perfection lower than its own, or to aim at any end more ignoble than
itself. ... It never more slides and degenerates from itself, than
when it becomes enthralled to some particular interest： as on the
other side it never acts more freely or fully, than when it extends
itself upon the most universal end.
