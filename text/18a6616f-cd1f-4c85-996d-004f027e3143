The ten thousand things all hushed and silent,
intent upon hearing these upright tones --
when human hearts are all like this,
then the world will be at peace.
Hsiang waters pouring forth autmn blue,
ancient winds blowing across the great void --
I heard them long ago when you played on Mt. Lu;
this evening I discover them again.
