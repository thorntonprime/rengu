I say that next to God there is no nobler thing than suffering. ... I hold,
if anything were nobler than suffering, God would have saved mankind
therewith, for we might well accuse him of being unfriendly to his Son if he
knew of something superior to suffering. ...  Further, I maintain, no man
apart from God has ever been so holy or so good as to deserve the least
nobility such as the smallest suffering would give. ... I tell you, right
suffering is the mother of all virtues, for right suffering so subdues the
heart, it cannot rise to pride but perforce is lowly.
