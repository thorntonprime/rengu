Thou art violently carried away from graceï¼š there is a devil haunts thee in
the likeness of a fat old man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou
converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that
swoln parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag
of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that
reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years?
Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it? wherein neat and cleanly
but to carve a capon and eat it? wherein cunning but in craft? wherein crafty
but in villany?  wherein villanous but in all things? wherein worthy but in
nothing?
