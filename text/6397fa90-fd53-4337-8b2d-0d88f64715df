When people keep repeating
That you'll never fall in love
When everybody keeps retreating
But you can't seem to get enough

Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door
Let my love open the door to your heart

Let my love open the door, ooh
My love open the door
Let my love open the door, ooh
My love open the door

When everything feels all over
  Let my love open the door, ooh
When everybody seems unkind
I'll give you a four leaf clover
  Let my love open the door, ooh
Take all the worry out of your mind

Let my love open the door, ooh
To your heart
Let my love open the door, ooh
Let my love open the door, ooh
Let my love open the door, ooh

I have the only key to your heart
I can stop you falling apart
Try today, you'll find this way
Come on and give me a chance to say

Let my love open the door
It's all I'm living for
Release yourself from misery
There's only one thing gonna set you free
That's my love, that's my love

Let my love open the door
  To your heart
Let my love open the door
  To your heart
Let my love open the door
  To your heart
Let my love open the door

When tragedy befalls you
  Let my love open the door, ooh
Don't let it drag you down
Love can cure your problems
  Let my love open the door, ooh
You're so lucky I'm around
