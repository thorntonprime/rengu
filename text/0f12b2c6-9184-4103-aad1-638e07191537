The man who forged swords for the Minister of War was eighty years of
age. Yet he never made the slightest slip in his work.

The Minister of War said to him, ‘Is it your skill, Sir, or have you
any method?’

‘It is concentration,’ replied the man. ‘When twenty years old, I took
to forging swords. I cared for nothing else. If a thing was not a
sword, I did not notice it. I availed myself of whatever energy I did
not use in other directions in order to secure greater efficiency in
the direction required. Still more of that which is never without use
(Tao); so that there was nothing which did not lend its aid.’
