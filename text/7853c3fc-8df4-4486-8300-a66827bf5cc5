Title: Fiddling with the Idiot & Hopeful
Description: December 11
---
Once when I was fussing with my hair in front of a looking glass, my
master walked by and said,

Hafiz, why are you always fiddling with the idiot? You should starve
him a day or two now and then.  Simply don’t look in a mirror.

Once a week I started abstaining from vanity. No mirror.

Then I went to twice a week, then four times. Then a little bird
started to build a nest in my beard and let out melodious chants in
the morning.

It was then I realized I was probably onto something big… and began
walking around looking very hopeful.
