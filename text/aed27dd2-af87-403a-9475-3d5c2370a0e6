I say not but that evermore some men shall say or think somewhat against us,
the whiles we live in the travail of this life, as they did against Mary. But
I say, if we will give no more heed to their saying nor to their thinking,
nor no more leave off our ghostly privy work for their words and their
thoughts, than she did -- I say then that our Lord shall answer them in
spirit (if it shall be well with them that so say and so think) in such sort,
that they shall within few days have shame of their words and their thoughts.
