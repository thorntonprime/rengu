Thy mind, thy reason, and the love of thy soul are so mickle set in beholding
and in love of earthly things, that of ghostly things thou feelest right little.
Thou feelest no reforming in thy self, but thou art so belapped with this black
image of sin for aught that thou mayest do, that upon what side thou turnest
thee thou feelest thyself defouled and spotted with fleshly stirrings of this
foul image.
