Can the water of the (polluted) stream clear out the dung? Can man’s
knowledge sweep away the ignorance of his sensual self?

How shall the sword fashion its own hilt? Go, entrust this wound to a
surgeon.

Flies gather on every wound, so that no one sees the foulness of his
wound.

Those flies are your thoughts and your possessions： your wound is the
darkness of your states;

And if the Pir (spiritual master) lays a plaster on your wound, at
once the pain and lamentation are stilled.

So that you fancy it is healed, (whereas in reality) the ray of the
Diaster has shone upon the spot.

Beware! Do not turn your head away from the plaster, O you who are
wounded in the back, but recognize that that (healing of the wound)
proceeds from the ray： do not regard it as (proceeding) from your own
constitution.
