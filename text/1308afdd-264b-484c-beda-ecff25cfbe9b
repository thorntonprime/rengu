Title: A Deeper Reality
Description: January 24
---
All the worlds of the universe plunge into the Invisible as into a yet
deeper reality. Certain stars increase in intensity and extinguish
themselves in the angels' endless awareness. Others move toward
transformation slowly and with great effort, and their next
self-realization occurs in fear and terror.

We are the transformers of Earth. Our whole being, and the flights and
falls of our love, enable us to undertake this task.
