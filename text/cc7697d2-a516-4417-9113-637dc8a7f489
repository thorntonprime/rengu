Warwick：
My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite：
The prince but studies his companions
Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
’Tis needful that the most immodest word
Be look'd upon, and learn’d; which once attain’d,
Your highness knows, comes to no further use
But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
The prince will in the perfectness of time
Cast off his followers; and their memory
Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
By which his Grace must mete the lives of others.
Turning past evils to advantages.

King Henry：
'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
In the dead carrion.
