This will be my solitude,
to be separated from myself so that I am able to love You alone,
to love You so much that I no longer reaize I am loving anything.
For such a realization implies a consciousness of a self that is separated
  from You.
I no longer desire to be myself, but to find myself transformed in You,
so that there is no "myself" but only Yourself.
That is when I will be what You have willed to make me from all eternityï¼š
not myself, but Love.
Thus will be fulfilled in me, as You will it to be fullfilled,
Your reason for the creation of the world and of me in it.
