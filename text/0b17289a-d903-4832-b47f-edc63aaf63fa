It is no hard matter to despise human comfort, when we have that which
is divine.

It is much and very much, to be able to lack both human and divine
comfort： and, for God’s honor, to be willing cheerfully to endure
desolation of heart： and to seek oneself in nothing, nor to regard
one’s own merit.
