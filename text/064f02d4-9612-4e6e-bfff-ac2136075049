Daiju visited the master Baso in China. Baso asked： "What do you
seek?"

"Enlightenment," replied Daiju.

"You have your own treasure house. Why do you search outside?"
Baso asked.

Daiju inquired： "Where is my treasure house?"

Baso answered： "What you are asking is your treasure house."

Daiju was enlightened! Ever after he urged his friends： "Open
your own tresure house and use those treasures."
