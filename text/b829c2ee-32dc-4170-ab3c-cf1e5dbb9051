Title: That Knowledge You Will Not Be Able to Accept
Description: March 21
---
The parents of three young birds got shot by a hunter.

After a few days of no food the two largest birds killed their
brother; they ate him and picked at his bones for a week.

Then that hunger we have all known set in again, which would cause
many to do most anything, if that ache did last; and it did and thus
other wings never climbed into the air.

A few more nights passed, and then it was at sunrise the lone bird
fell from its nest, though it survived on the ground eating some ants,
and then one day it did fly.

Its song came to please many ears, its beauty enhanced the eye of
those who saw it. Even a loving parent it became.

The guards at the gate of heaven are such good friends of mine, you
should know

there is nothing you have ever done that is not innocent and will in
any way be judged as wrong by anyone of true wisdom,

but such knowledge you will not be able to accept until your and an
angel’s ways are more similar. It just works like that.
