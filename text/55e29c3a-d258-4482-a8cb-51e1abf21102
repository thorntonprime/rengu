Someone complained to Meister Eckhart that no one could understand his
sermons. He said. To understand my sermons a man requires three things. He
must have conquered strife and be in contemplation of his highest good and be
satisfied to do God's bidding and be a beginner with beginners and naught
himself and be so master of himself as to be incapable of anger.
