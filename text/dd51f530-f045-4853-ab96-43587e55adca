God the Father has in Christâ€™s death and entrance into our humanity
again received our self hood into his will; and that this might be, he
first tinctured the humanity with the Realiz.  Deity, that the
humanity might be a pleasant sweet savour and offering to him in his
868 power, for before death lay before it. ...

And so we all must follow him upon the path which he has made open for
us; none can see God. unless God become first man in him.
