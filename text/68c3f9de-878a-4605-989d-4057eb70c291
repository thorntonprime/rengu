Description: Ode composed on his deathbed
Format: Verse
---
Say to my brethren when they see me dead,
  and weep for me, lamenting me in sadness：
‘Think ye I am this corpse ye are to bury?
  I swear by God, this dead one is not I.
When I had formal shape, then this, my body.
  Served as my garment. I wore it for a while.’
