Now, there are some ... who love to be a stumbling-block among
believers in the Vedas by the strategem of deceptive arguments in a
circle, and false and illogical examples.  With these one should not
associate. Verily, these creatures are evidently robbers, unfit for
heaven. For thus has it been saidï¼š

By the jugglery of a doctrine that denies the Soul,

By false comparisons and proofs

Disturbed, the world does not discern

What is the difference between knowledge and ignorance
