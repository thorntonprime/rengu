To avoid falling into this evil (of self-esteem) which threatens you,
always keep your mind collected in the heart and be for ever ready to
repulse these arrows of the enemy.  Standing there within, like a
general on the battlefield, choose a place of advantage for battle,
fortify it thoroughly and never leave it, but make it your shelter
from which to give battle. This place, its fortification and armament,
is a profound and sincere realisation of your nothingness, of the fact
that you are poor, blind, naked and rich only in weaknesses, faults
and deeds that are blameworthy, foolish, vain and sinful.  Having
taken up this position, never let your mind wander outside your
fortress.
