Beware lest at the time of your departure from the body you allow
oblivion and fear to interpose between you and the road, that you may
not wander from the road and go astray. But if you should (at any
time) forget it, seek to recall it to your memory; and to that end,
make use of what is told you by those who have already travelled along
that road, and know it by experience; for they are the masters of
right guidance： they are lights in the darkness.
