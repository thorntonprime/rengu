Men must use natural love and abhor the unnatural, not intentionally
destroying the seeds of human increase, or sowing them in stony
places, in which they will take no root. ... Our citizens must not
fall below the nature of birds and beasts. ... No one shall venture to
touch any person of the freeborn or noble class except his wedded
wife, or sow the unconsecrated and bastard seed among harlots, or in
barren and unnatural lusts; at least we must abolish altogether the
connection of men with men.
