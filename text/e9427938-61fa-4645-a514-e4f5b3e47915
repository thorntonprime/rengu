  This is one way of putting it. Metaphysically it would be more exact
  to say that the visible world of necessity reflects the supernal,
  being but an emanation from it.

Were there no relation between the two worlds, no inter connexion at
all, then all upward progress would be inconceivable from one to the
other.  Therefore, the divine mercy gave to the World Visible a
correspondence with the World of the Realm Supernal, and for this
reason there is not a single things in this world of sense that is not
a symbol of something in yonder one. It may well hap that some one
thing in this world may symbolize several things in the World of the
Realm Supernal, and equally well that some one thing in the latter may
have several symbols in the World Visible.  We call a thing typical or
symbolic when it resembles and corresponds to its antitype under some
aspect.
