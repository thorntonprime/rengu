Be it known to all manner of people in this wretched dwelling-place of
exile abiding, that no man may be imbued with love of endless life,
nor be anointed with heavenly sweetness, unless he truly be turned to
God. It behoves truly he be turned to Him, and from all earthly things
be altogether turned in mind, before he may be expert in the sweetness
of God's love, even in little things.
