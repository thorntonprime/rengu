As the spider weaves its thread out of its own mouth, plays with it, and then
withdraws it again into itself, so the eternal, unchangeable Lord, who is
formless and attributeless, who is absolute knowledge, and absolute bliss,
evolves the whole universe out of himself, plays with it, and again withdraws
it into himself.
