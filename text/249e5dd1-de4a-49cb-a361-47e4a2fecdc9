Comment: |
  By this interpretation, the 'coats of skins' in which God clothed fallen
  man would correspond with the exteriorization of the individual and
  corporeal state—as is moreover indicated by Boehme himself in a later
  passage from the same work (XXI. 16). Cf. also the citation of Scotus
  Erigena in the chapter 'Holiness'.

Men would have gone naked upon the earth, for the Celestial interpenetrated
the Exterior and was its garment： and he (Adam) moved in great beauty, joy
and pleasure, with a childlike heart. He would have drunken and eaten
magically, not in the body as now He had no sleep in him, night was to him
as the day： for he saw with glorious eyes by means of his own light; the
interior man, interior eye, saw across the exterior; just as in the next
world we shall have no need of the sun, for we shall see with divine vision,
by the light of our own nature.
