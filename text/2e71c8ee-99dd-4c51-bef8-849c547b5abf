---
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchas’d, take my daughter： but
If thou dost break her virgin knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister’d,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
Sour-ey’d disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
that you shall hate it both： therefore take heed.
As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.
