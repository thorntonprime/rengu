The past time has departed, so that it no longer is： and the future is not
in existence, in that it has not yet arrived. And even the present is not ...
in that it does not abide. For seeing that the present does not stand fast,
and does not abide even for an instant, how can it be said to be ’present',
when it cannot stand fast for one moment?
