These things I learnt at last, after I had repented concerning Joseph.
For true repentance after a godly sort destroyeth ignorance, and
driveth away the darkness, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth
knowledge to the soul, and leadeth the mind to salvation. And those
things which it hath not learnt from man, it knoweth through
repentance.
