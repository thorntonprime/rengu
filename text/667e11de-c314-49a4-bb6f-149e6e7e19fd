Souls that are entangled, involved in worldliness, never come to their
senses. They lie in the net but are not even conscious that they are
entangled. If you speak of God before them, they at once leave the place.
They say： 'Why God now? We shall think of Him in the hour of death.’ But
when they lie on their death beds, they say to their wives or children： ‘Why
have you put so many wicks in the lamp? Use only one wick.  Otherwise too
much oil will be burnt.'
