As long as you were in the world of simple (incomposite) things, (O Soul),
you had plenty of things to see and know; for you could see all the worlds
displayed before you, pure and bright and shining; and down below, at the
bottom of all, was situated the world of things that come to be and cease
to be, -- a dark and murky world having as little brightness in comparison
with them as has a black stone that is seen amidst transparent water.

Well, you thought fit to enter this (dark) world, that you might find out
by experience what sort of place it is： and having decided to do so, you
forsook the high level of the simple things, and came down to the low level
of the mixed things. And so, eagerly seeking the things you longed for,
you departed (from your home above), and came into the world of things that
come to be. In thus forsaking the world of simple things, and seeking after
and desiring the world of composite (or concrete) things, you were like a
bird that makes for the snare, to take the berry that is placed there,
and finds its own life taken by the snare; or like a fish that wants to eat
the fisherman’s bait, and is itself eaten by the fisherman.
