If you reallu forsake your own knowledge and will,
then surely and gladly God will enter with His knowledge
shining clearly.

Where God achieves self-consciousness,
your own knowledge is of no use, nor has it standing.

Do not imagine that your own intelligence may rise to it,
so that you may know God.

When God divinely enlightens you,
no natural light is required to bring that about.
Natural light must in fact be completely extinguished
before God will shine in with His light,
bringing back with Him all that you have forsaken
and a thousand times more,
together with a new form to contain it all.

This it is true that you cannot know God by means of any creature science
nor by means of your own wisdom.
If you are to know God divinely,
your own knowledge must become as pure ignorance,
in which you forget yourself and every other creature.
