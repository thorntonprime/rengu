It is true that we can do no good thing without God’s ordinary
influence, except we make progress by means of a special influence
from the Holy Spirit： yet, at the same time, man may do his part,
inasmuch as his will has power to withstand the offers of the Holy
Spirit, and to cleave to his own way. God does not justify a man
without his own free will： even as our eyes cannot see except they
are enlightened by the sun or any other light, yet even when we have
the light we must open our eyes, or we can never see it.
