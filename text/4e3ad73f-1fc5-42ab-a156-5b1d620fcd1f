--- Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not
come unto you the like of (that which came to) those who passed away
before you? Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as
with earthquake, till the messenger and those who believed along with
him said： When cometh Allâh’s help? Now surely Allâh's help is nigh.
