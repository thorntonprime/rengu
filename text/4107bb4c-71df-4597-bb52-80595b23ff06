A brother who restrains the controlling faculties should be like the Elder
Chittagutta who lived in the great Kurandaka cave. ... At the cave-entrance
there was a great ironwood tree. But the Elder had never looked up at it. It
is said that he knew that it was in blossom when each spring he saw the
filaments that fell to the ground.
