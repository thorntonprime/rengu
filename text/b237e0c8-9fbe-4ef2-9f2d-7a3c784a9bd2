  - Body: You must not be astonished at anything that comes up, no matter
      how shameful. Accept it all calmly, as if you were a mere spectator,
      uninterested, and were observing a process for which you need not feel
      responsible. Simply let it go on until it wearies of itself, while you
      listen with only half an ear. The result, in the end. is perfect
      stillness, which breathes without your noticing it.

Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh：
Speak but one rime and I am satisfied：
Cry but ‘Ay me!" couple but ‘love" and ‘dove：’
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word.
One nickname for her purblind son and heir.
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
He heareth not. he stirreth not. he moveth not：
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes.
By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip.
By her fine foot, straight leg. and quivering thigh.
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie.
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
