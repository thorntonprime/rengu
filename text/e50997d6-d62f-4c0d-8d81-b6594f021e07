It is the part of every Child of Light, to maintain the Divine Love in his
Spirit, like the Sun in the Firmament, encompassing the whole Earth, from one
end to the other, shining upon all. both good and bad. upon dry and sandy
Desarts. the Habitations of wild Beasts, and venemous Serpents, as well as
cultivated Gardens, flourishing with wholesome Herbs, pleasant Flowers, and all
sorts of fruits. Thus God himself is propounded to us for a Pattern by the Son
of Good.
