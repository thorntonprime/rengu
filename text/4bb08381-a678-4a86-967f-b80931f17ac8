Heeeey you would’ve cast and not regret
When it’s time to plaaay
You are the kind that’s out of place
You come on out and plaaaay heeeeeeeeey

Another one
Another time
Love that is the right
But it could never be so wide
An ocean wide, a river tide
Fall beneath the night and I could never reach so high

Light my way
Fill me up
Light my way
Give me the chance to play

Fill me up
With your love
Light my way
Give me the chance to play

Heeeey you would’ve cast and not regret
When it’s time to geeet heeeey
Give me the chance to play
You come on out and plaaaay heeeeeeeeey

Give me the chance to play

Light my way
Light my way
Fill me up
With your love
Light my way
Light my way

Heeeey you would’ve cast and not regret
When it’s time to geeet heeeey
Give me the chance to play
You come on out and plaaaay heeeeeeeeey

Give me the chance to play
