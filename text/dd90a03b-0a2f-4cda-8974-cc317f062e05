Lamentation and weeping are a mighty stock-in-trade： the Universal
Mercy is the mightiest nurse.

The nurse and mother seeks a pretext (for giving relief)： (she waits
to see) when her child will begin to weep.

He (God) created the child, your wants, in order that it might moan
and that milk might be produced for it.

He said. 'Call ye upon God!’ Refrain not thou from lamentation, in
order that the milk of his lovingkindnesses may flow.
