And therefore for Godâ€™s love beware in this work, and strain not thy
heart in thy breast over-rudely nor out of measure; but work more with
a list than with any idle strength. For the more listily thou workest,
the more meek and ghostly is thy work; and the more rudely, the more
bodily and beastly. And therefore beware. For surely the beastly heart
that presumeth to touch the high mount of this work shall be beaten
away with stones.
