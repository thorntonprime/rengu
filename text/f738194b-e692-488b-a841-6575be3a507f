For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation
and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
which we also sufferï¼š or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation
and salvation.
