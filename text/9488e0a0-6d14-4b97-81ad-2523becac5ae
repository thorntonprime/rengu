It is related concerning Jesus (Peace be upon him!) that he came on a
fire which was kindled over a man in the desert. Jesus then took water
to put it out, and the fire changed into a youth, and the man changed
into fire. So Jesus (Peace be upon him!) wept and said, ‘O Lord,
restore them to their former state that I may see what their sin was.’
Then that fire was removed from them, and lo! they were a man and a
youth. The man said, ‘O Jesus, I have been afflicted in the world by
love of this youth, and desire urged me on until I sinned with him one
Thursday night, after which I sinned with him another day. Then a man
came upon us and said to us, ‘Woe to you! Fear God!’ I replied to him,
‘I am not afraid, and I do not fear.’ Then when I died, and the youth
died, God (Great and glorious is He!) turned us into what you see.
Sometimes he becomes fire and burns me, and sometimes I become fire
and burn him. And this is our punishment until the Day of
Resurrection.’
