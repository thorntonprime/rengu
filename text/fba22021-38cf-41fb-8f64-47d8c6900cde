At the present moment many educated persons and college students have
lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of
the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly
deplorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed,
proud and atheistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough
overhauling and drastic flushing.
