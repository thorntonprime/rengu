No longer am I trapped by the illusion that my body
is anything more than the play of the universe.
I have escaped from this illusion.
That which is within is the same as that which is without.
That which is infinite is the same as that which is finite.
Seeing all things anew, I have become drunk with the
light of God that fills the universe.
Life and death no longer have any hold on me.
