And there was Lot, when he said to his people, Lo, ye practise
iniquity that has no precedent in the whole of creation!

For do ye not come in unto males, and cut off the Way, and bring
abomination into your assemblies? And there was no response from his
people, except to say, Bring upon us the punishment of God if thou art
of the truthful!

He said, My Lord, deliver me from the people of depravity!

And when Our messengers brought Abraham glad tidings (of a son), they
said： Lo! we are about to destroy the people of that township, for
its people are wrong-doers.

He said： Lo! Lot is there. They said. We best know who is there! ...

And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people of reflection.
