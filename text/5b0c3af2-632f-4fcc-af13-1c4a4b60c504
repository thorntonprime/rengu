Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

Art thou called being a servant? care not for it： but if thou mayest
be made free, use it rather.

For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s
freeman： likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s
servant.

Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
