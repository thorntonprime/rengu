Title: The King Inside
Description: June 17
---
There are people with their eyes open
whose hearts are shut. What do they see? Matter.

But someone whose love is alert,
even if the eyes go to sleep,
he or she will be waking up thousands of others.

If you are not one of those light-filled lovers,
restrain your desire-body's intensity.
Put limits on how much you eat
and how long you lie down.

But if you are awake here in the chest,
sleep long and soundly.
Your spirit will be out roaming and working,
even on the seventh level.
Muhammed says, I close my eyes and rest in sleep,
but my love never needs to rest.

The guard at the gate drowses.
The king stays awake. You have a king inside
who listens for what delights the soul.

That king's wakefulness
cannot be described in a poem.
