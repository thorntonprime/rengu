What is there that the fire of hell shall feed upon, but thy sins?

The more thou sparest thyself now and followest the flesh, the more
severe hereafter shall be thy punishment, and thou storest up greater
fuel for that flame.

In what things a man hath sinned, in the same shall he be the more
grievously punished.

There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning goads, and
the gluttons be tormented with extreme hunger and thirst.

There shall the luxurious and lovers of pleasure be bathed in burning
pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious, like mad dogs, shall
howl for very grief.

There is no sin but shall have its own proper torment
