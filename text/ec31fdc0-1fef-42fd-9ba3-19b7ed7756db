By the morning hours
And by the night when it is stillest.
Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee.
And verily the last state will be better for thee than the first.
And verily thy Lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content.
Did He not find thee an orphan and protect thee?
Did He not find thee wandering and direct thee?
Did He not find thee destitute and enrich thee?
Therefor the orphan oppress not.
Therefor the beggar drive not away.
Therefor of the bounty of thy Lord be thy discourse.
