Goodness is to be seen in its perfection only when man’s virtue is fortified
against desire, and he scorns all things that are alien to him. Now all
earthly things which man holds in his possession to gratify his bodily
desires are alien to all that part of his nature which is akin to God; and
these things are rightly called ‘possessions’, for this reason, that they
were not born with us, but we began to get possession of them at a later
time. All such things then are alien to man; yes, and the body too we must
regard as alien, that so we may scorn not only the objects of our greed, but
also that which is the source of the vicious greed within us.
