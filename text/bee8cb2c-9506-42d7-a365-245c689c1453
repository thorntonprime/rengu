Every form you see has its archetype in the placeless world：
If the form perished, no matter, since its original is everlasting.
Every fair shape you have seen, every deep saying you have heard.
Be not cast down that it perished; for that is not so.
Whereas the spring head is undying, its branch gives water continually：
Since neither can cease, why are you lamenting?
Conceive the Soul as a fountain, and these created things as rivers：
While the fountain flows, the rivers run from it.
Put grief out of your head and keep quaffing this river-water：
Do not think of the water failing： for this water is without end.
