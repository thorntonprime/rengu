It is true the world will be apt enough to censure thee for a madman in walking
contrary to it： And thou art not to be surprised if the children thereof laugh
at thee, calling thee silly fool. For the way to the love of God is folly to
the world, but is wisdom to the children of God. Hence, whenever the world
perceiveth this holy fire of love in God’s children, it concludeth immediately
that they are turned fools, and are besides themselves. But to the children of
God, that which is despised of the world is the greatest treasure.
