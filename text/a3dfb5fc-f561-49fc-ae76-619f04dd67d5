Tags:
  - Sacrifice-Death=Sacrifice and Suffering=Suffering Transmuted Into Joy
Commentary: |
  Egeas was the proconsul of Patrae who persecuted St. Andrew.

How long delay I, speaking thus, and embrace not the cross, that by the cross
I may be made alive, and by the cross (win) the common death of all and
depart out of life?

Come hither ye ministers of joy unto me, ye servants of Aegeates; accomplish
the desire of us both, and bind the lamb unto the wood of suffering, the man
unto the maker, the soul unto the Saviour.
