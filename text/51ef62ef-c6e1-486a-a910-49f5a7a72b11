O son of Kunti, dangerous are the senses, they even carry away forcibly the
mind of a discriminative man who is striving for perfection.

The man of steady wisdom, having subdued them all (senses), becomes fixed in
Me. the Supreme. His wisdom is well-established whose senses are under
control.

Thinking of sense-objects. man becomes attached thereto. From attachment
arises longing and from longing anger is born.

From anger arises delusion; from delusion, loss of memory is caused. From
loss of memory, the discriminative faculty is ruined and from the ruin of
discrimination, he perishes.
