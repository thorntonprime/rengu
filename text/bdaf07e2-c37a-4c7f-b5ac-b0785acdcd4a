Commentary: |
  Which does not advocate abandoning the dictates of intelligence!
  Those who habitually lean on this phrase out of conciliatory
  sentiments forget that judgment implies alternatives, and that apart
  from the discipline of a strict neutrality, which is precisely what
  lacks with them, their acquiescence or ‘tolerance’ is already a
  decision •pro' for which they are responsible, and hence a judgment --
  at the risk of abusing this word to describe what is usually only a
  pre-judice, or idée fixe, i.e. ‘misjudgment’. These apologists, who
  say that ‘God alone can judge’, are first to affirm ‘the Divine in
  every man’, easily overlooking the fact that it is precisely this
  Principle in man which has the capacity for judgment -- otherwise as
  well renounce all claims to intellectuality or intelligence.  Life,
  especially the spiritual life, is a succession of discernments and
  judgments, without this having to mean in any way an intrusion upon
  God's domain of final judgment.

Judge not, that ye be not judged.

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged： and with what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
