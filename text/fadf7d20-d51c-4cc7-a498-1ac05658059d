Title: A River Understands
Description: December 29
---
I used to know my name. Now I donâ€™t. I think a river understands me.

For what does it call itself in that blessed moment when it starts
emptying into the Infinite Luminous Sea,

and opening every aspect of self wider than it ever thought possible?

Each drop of itself now running to embrace and unite with a million
new friends.

And you were there, in my union with All, everyone who will ever see
this page.
