By: Julian of Norwich
---
As good as God is, so great He is; and as much as it belongeth to His
goodness to be loved, so much it belongeth to His greatness to be
dreaded. For this reverent dread is the fair courtesy that is in
Heaven afore Godâ€™s face. And as much as He shall then be known and
loved overpassing that He is now, in so much He shall be dreaded
overpassing that He is now.
