We see a clear proof of it in Adam and Eve, when the wrath awoke into the
quality which was in them and took command： thus it appears in most men where
the outward part of the soul rules over the entire body and where the bestial
man seeks only the pleasure of this world, that is to say the outward
honours, the power and beauty, the food and drink which make an animal of
him： he is therefore proud to be a beast, as proud as if he were a god.
although he is only a wretched and perishable beast in which the true man is
shut up without life.
