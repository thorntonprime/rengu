Also God shewed that sin shall be no shame to man, but worship. For right as
to every sin is answering a pain by truth, right so for every sin, to the same
soul is given a bliss by love： right as diverse sins are punished with diverse
pains according as they be grievous, right so shall they be rewarded with
diverse joys in Heaven according as they have been painful and sorrowful to
the soul in earth. For the soul that shall come to Heaven is precious to God,
and the place so worshipful that the goodness of God suffereth never that
soul to sin that shall come there without that the which sin shall be rewarded;
and it is made known without end. and blissfully restored by overpassing
worship.

For in this Sight mine understanding was lifted up into Heaven, and then God
brought merrily to my mind David, and others in the Old Law without number：
and in the New Law He brought to my mind first Mary Magdalene, Peter and
Paul ... and others also without number.
