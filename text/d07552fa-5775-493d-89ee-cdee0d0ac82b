Title: Leave Something in the Marketplace
Description: March 20
---
Sometimes it can happen to these cheeks when a poem visits my mind for
the first time and begins to look around.

They can wonder why rain is falling on them, and causing my nose to
run too.

O boy, what a mess love makes of me. But there is nothing else right
now I would rather

be doing ... than reaping something from a field in another dimension

and leaving it in the marketplace for any who might happen by.

Leave something in the marketplace for us before you leave this world.
