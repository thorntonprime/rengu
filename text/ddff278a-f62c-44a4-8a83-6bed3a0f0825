This world, rightly regarded, is a place for learning truth in. The visible
forms of things which it presents to our senses are fleeting and perishableï¼š
but they are semblances or shadows of forms that are not apprehensible by
sense, forms that are real and everlasting.  ... The deceptive and fleeting
pleasures of the sense-world suggest to us that we should turn from them to
the true and unceasing pleasures of the thought-world; the frail, transitory,
and perishable forms of the sense-world bid us turn from them to the stable
and constant forms of the thought-world.
