Commentary: A proround synthesis of the whole spiritual method.

As long as the notion of first person exists, the notions of second
and third persons also exist. When, through reflection upon oneâ€™s
reality, the notion of first person is destroyed, the notions of
second and third persons also disappear, and the resulting state is
alone the true State of Self, revealed as One.
