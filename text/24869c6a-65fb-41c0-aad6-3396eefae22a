The trew men search and seeke ail alone
In hope to finde our delectable stone,
And for that thei would that no Man shulde have losse,
They prove and seeke all at their owne Coste;
Soe their owne Purses they will not spare,
They make their Coffers thereby full bare,
With greate Patience thei doe proceede.
Trusting only in God to be their speede.
