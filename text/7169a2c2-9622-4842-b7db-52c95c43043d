Give yourself up to ever so many good works, read, preach, pray, visit
the sick, build hospitals, clothe the naked, etc., yet if anything
goes along with these or in the doing of them you have anything else
that you will and hunger after, but that Godâ€™s kingdom may come and
His will be done, they are not the works of the new-born from above
and so cannot be his life-giving food.
