He was, indeed, as large as a woman and a man closely embraced. He caused
that self to fall into two pieces. Therefrom arose a husband and a wife. ...
He copulated with her. Therefrom human beings were produced.

And she then bethought herself： ‘How now does he copulate with me after he
has produced me just from himself? Come, let me hide myself.’ She became a
cow. He became a bull. With her he did indeed copulate. Then cattle were born.
She became a mare, he a stallion. She became a female ass, he a male ass;
with her he copulated, of a truth. Thence were born solid-hoofed animals.
She became a she-goat, he a he-goat; she a ewe, he a ram. With her he did
verily copulate. Therefrom were born goats and sheep. Thus, indeed, he created
all, whatever pairs there are, even down to the ants.
