A monk should constantly call： ‘Lord. Jesus Christ. Son of God. have
mercy upon me!' in order that this remembering of the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ should incite him to battle with the enemy. By this
remembranc1 a soul forcing itself to this practice can discover
everything which is within, both good and bad. First it will see
within, in the heart, what is bad, and later -- what is good. This
remembrance is for rousing the serpent, and this remembrance is for
subduing it. This remembrance can reveal the sin living in us. and
this remembrance can destroy it. This remembrance can arouse all the
enemy hosts in the heart, and little by little this remembrance can
conquer and uproot them. The name of our Lord Jesus Christ, descending
into the depths of the heart, will subdue the serpent holding sway
over the pastures of the heart, and will save our soul and bring it to
life.
