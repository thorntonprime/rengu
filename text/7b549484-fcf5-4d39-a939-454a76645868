One day he (Bâyazid al-Bistâmî) was walking with a number of his disciples. The
path was very narrow. He saw a dog coming along and turned back to let it pass.
One of his disciples blamed him secretly and thought to himself. 'How can
Bâyazid, who is the king of gnostics, make way for a dog?’ Bâyazid said. This
dog asked me with dumb eloquence, saying. “In the eternal past what fault did I
commit, and what act of grace didst thou perform, that I am clad in the skin of
a dog, while the robe of spiritual royalty hath been conferred on thee?” This
thought came into my head and I made way for the dog.
