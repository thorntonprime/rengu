I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things ; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty.
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty. ...
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour： treason, felony.
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine.
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth.
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance.
To feed my innocent people.
