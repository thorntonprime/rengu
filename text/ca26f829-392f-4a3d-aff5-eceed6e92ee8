I am persuaded that it is only by the gift of God that this Art can be
understood. If, indeed, subtlety and mental acuteness were all that is
necessary for its apprehension, I have met with many strong minds, well fitted
for the investigation of such subjects. But I tell youï¼š Be simple, and not
overwise, until you have found the secret. Then you will be obliged to be
prudent, and you will easily be able to compose any number of books, which is
doubtless more simple for him who is in the centre and beholds the thing
itself, than one who is on the circumference only, and can only go by hearsay.
