Mony clif he overclambe - in contrayes straunge.
Fer floten fro his frendes - fremedly he rides.
At eche warthe other water - ther the wighe passed
He fonde a foo him before. - bot ferly hit were.
And that so foule and so felle - that feght him behode.
So mony mervayl bi mount - ther the mon findes.
Hit were to tore for to telle - of the tenthe dole.
Sumwhile with wormes he werres. - and with wolves als.
Sumwhile with wodwos. - that woned in the knarres.
Bothe with bulles and beres. - and bores otherwhile.
And etaines. that him anelede - of the heghe felleï¼š
Nade he ben dughty and drighe. - and Drighten had served.
Douteless he hade ben ded - and dreped ful ofte.
For werre wrathed him not so much. - that winter was wors. ...
