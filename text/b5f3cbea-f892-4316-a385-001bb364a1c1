Title: The Solitude We Are
Description: January 27

To speak again of solitude, it becomes ever clearer that in truth
there is nothing we can choose or avoid. We are solitary. We can
delude ourselves and act as if this were not so. That is all we can
do. How much better to realize from the start that that is what we
are, and to proceed from there. It can, of course, make us dizzy, for
everything our eyes rest upon will be taken from us, no longer is
anything near, and what is far is endlessly far.
