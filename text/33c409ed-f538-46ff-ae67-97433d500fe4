Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a
little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief
visited the hut only to discover there was nothing to steal.

Ryokan returned and caught him. "You have come a long way to
visit me," he told the prowler, "and you should not return
empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift."

The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.

Ryoken sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow," he mused, "I
wish I could have given him this beautiful moon."
