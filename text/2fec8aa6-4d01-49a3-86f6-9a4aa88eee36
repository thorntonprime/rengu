Title: It Was Beautiful One Night
Description: February 6
---
It was beautiful, it was so beautiful one night we all began to expect
God would speak

from the waves reaching toward the millet fields,

from the mouths of the hanging sky ornaments crooning in lightâ€™s
infinite codes,

from the glances of children and plants and hills playing with
effulgent life.

It was beautiful, it was so beautiful one night we all began to expect
God would speak.
