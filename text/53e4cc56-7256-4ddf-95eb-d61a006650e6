Title: Out of the Mouths of a Thousand Birds
Description: December 16-17
---
Listen, listen more carefully to what is around you right now.

In my world there are the bells from the clanks of the morning milk
drums

and a wagon wheel outside my window just hit a bump,

which turned into an ecstatic chorus of the Belovedâ€™s Name.

And there is the Prayer Call rising up like the sun out of the mouths
of a thousand birds.

There is an astonishing vastness of movement and life emanating sound
and light

from my folded hands, and my even quieter simple being and heart.

My dear, is it true that your mind is sometimes like a battering ram

running all through the city and the villages shouting

so madly inside and out about the hundreds of things that do not
matter?

Hafiz, too, for many years beat his head in youth and thought

himself at a great distance, far from an armistice with God.

But that is why this scarred old pilgrim has now become such a sweet
rare vintage who weeps and plays a drum for you.

That is why Hafiz will forever in his verse play his cymbal and sing
to you.

O listen, O listen more carefully to what is around you right now.

In my world all that remains is the wondrous call to dance and prayer

rising up like a thousand suns, out of the mouth of a single bird.
