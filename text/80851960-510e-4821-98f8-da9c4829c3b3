Title: In Case Things Really Got Hot
Description: April 18
---
She said I could touch her all I wanted, a beautiful woman I met.

That inspired me to develop my spirit body more,

which was less intimidated by time and space, and had a lot more
stamina tooâ€¦ in case things really got hot!

I thought she would have acted more surprised and delighted when I
finally kissed her with all my passion,

but the moon was more poised than I knew
