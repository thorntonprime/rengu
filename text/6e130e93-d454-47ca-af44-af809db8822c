Magicians, who are commonly called witches, are thus termed on account
of the magnitude of their evil deeds. These are they who by the
permission of God disturb the elements, who drive to distraction the
minds of men, such as have lost their trust in God, and by the
terrible power of their evil spells, without any actual draught or
poison, kill human beings.
