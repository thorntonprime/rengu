Title: The Buddha Stood by and Watched

It is just love and I now, doing whatever
happens.

If someone were to spill some soup upon
me, I would understand, knowing it wanted
to get close the best it could.

All comes your way for a reason. Everything
is working the room and making valuable
connections.

It snowed once, more than it had in years,
above a village in Tibet, and come spring the
temperature climbed way higher than normal.

A tidal wave of slush roared down the mountain
and wiped out many families. THe Buddha
stood by and watched, then walked slowly off.

What the average person did not see was
that all those souls dove headfirst into him.
He mixed them in his beind. THey ran through
his veins shouting with joy.

What could you know of anything if you have
a list of complaints against old friends.
