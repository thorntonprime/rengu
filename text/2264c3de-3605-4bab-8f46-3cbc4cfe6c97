A half-hour of silent repose after meditation is necessary; for at
the time of meditation you may not obtain the desired effect; it can
come a little afterwards. Remember also that turning the attention
abruptly to secular things right after meditation not only does much
harm in general, but more particularly hinders the growth of spirit
towards realization.
