Title: At Birth the Throne Was Promised
Description: March 19
---
At birth the throne was promised to the first son of a king.

A promise that did not even have to be given. It was simply understood
by all in the world who were aware. It would never be questioned.

And the idea of worth or un-worth never entered the mind of the prince
as he grew,

and it should not enter yours any longer, as you now take your place,
your seat upon the holy realm again for us.
