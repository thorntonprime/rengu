When God desires to reveal Himself to His slave by a Name or Quality, He
extinguishes him, annihilating his self and his existence; then, when the
creaturely light is extinguished, and the individuality is effaced. God
establishes in the creaturely temple (haykal), but without divine localization
(hulúl). a subtle reality which is neither detached from God nor conjoined to
the creature, thus replacing what He stripped him of,—for God reveals Himself
to His slaves through generosity; if He annihilated them without compensation,
this would not be generosity on His part, but severity; far from Him to act
thus! This subtle reality is what one calls the Holy Spirit (ar-rûh al-quds).
And when God establishes in place of the slave a subtle reality of His Essence,
His revelation is communicated to this reality, so that He never reveals
Himself except to Himself, although we have called this divine subtle reality
‘slave’, since it takes his place. Actually, there is neither slave nor Lord,
for if the slave no longer exists, the Lord ceases to be Lord; in reality,
nothing remains but God alone, the Unique, the One.
