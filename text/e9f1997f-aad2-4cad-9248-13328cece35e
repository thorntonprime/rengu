Title: More Is Required
---
You have disappeared into the way?
Leave even that behind.

Sit with the essence inside love.
In that house of mirrors you will see hundreds
of sword blades. Do not be afraid to use them.

You have given up everything.
You must live in absence. More is required.

Mix an eye medicine with the ground.
Sweep the memory pictures clean.

Swing down and cut.
A voice comes in the broken place.

Pull the tree-wing up by its roots.
Love wants an arm and a leg.
