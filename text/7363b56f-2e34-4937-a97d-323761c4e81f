True and perfect obedience is a virtue above all virtues. No great
work can be accomplished without it; nor can there be any task,
however small or insignificant, which will not be done to better
purpose in obedience Obedience brings out the best of everything; it
never fails or errs in any matter; and no matter what you do. if you
do it in true obedience, it will not miss being good.

Obedience has no cares; it lacks no blessing. Being obedient, if a man
purifies himself.  God will come into him in course; for when he has
no will of his own.  then God will command for him what God would
command for himself. When 1 give my will up to the care of my prelate,
and have no will of my own. God must will for me; for if he were to
neglect me, he would be neglecting himself. So it is with everything;
where I do not choose Creation for myself. God chooses for me.
