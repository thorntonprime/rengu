Stay before Me in this world alone, and I will dispose thee in thy
grave alone, and bring thee forth therefrom alone unto Me, and thou
wilt stay before Me on the day of resurrection alone： and when thou
art alone, thou wilt see only my face： and when thou seest only my
face, there will be neither reckoning nor book： and when there is
neither reckoning nor book, then there will be no terror; and when
there is no terror, then thou wilt be one of the intercessors.
