Nothing hath separated us from God but our own will, or rather our own will
is our separation from God. ... The fall of man brought forth the kingdom of
this world; sin in all shapes is nothing else but the will of man driving on
in a state of self-motion and self-government, following the workings of a
nature broken off from its dependency upon, and union with, the divine will.
All the evil and misery in the creation arises only and solely from this one
cause.
