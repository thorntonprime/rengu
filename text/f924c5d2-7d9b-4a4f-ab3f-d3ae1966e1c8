Title: The Old Poet's Waking
Description: May 6
---
The old man's heart woke,
no longer in love with treble and bass,
without weeping or laughter.

In the true bewilderment of soul
he went out beyond any seeking, beyond words
and telling, drowned in the beauty,
drowned beyond deliverance.

Waves cover the old man.

Nothing more can be said of him.

He has shaken out his robe,
and there's nothing in it anymore.

There is a chase where a falcon
dives into the forest
and does not come back up.

Every moment, the sunlight
is totally empty and totally full.
