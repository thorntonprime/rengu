He who has made the pilgrimage of his own 'Self', a pilgrimage not
concerned with situation, place or time, which is everywhere, in which
neither heat nor cold are experienced, which procures a lasting
felicity and a final deliverance from all disturbance： such an one is
actionless. he knoweth all things, and he attaineth Eternal Bliss.
