Title: Longing for the Mountains of Solitude
Format: verse
---
Fooled in samsara town --
the endless cycle of countless chores,
preoccupations of a delusory world --
this boy’s mind longs for mountains of solitude.

Hassled by monastery life --
the hustle of duties and communal dues,
pursuits of pointless distraction—
This boy’s mind longs for mountains of solitude.

Whomever I look at, I see at death’s threshold;
whatever I think on, I sense denial of dying,
grasping at the deathless; in this courtyard of death,
this boy’s mind longs for mountains of solitude.

Whomever I meet with manifests clinging and repulsion;
whomever I talk to brings deception and lies;
faced by companions without virtuous conduct,
this boy’s mind longs for mountains of solitude.

Behold, beings in the three realms are fooled by afflictions;
the beings of the six realms are led astray;
delusion engenders the birth of suffering for all;
this boy’s mind longs for mountains of solitude.

By the blessings of the undeceiving guru and the [Three] Jewels,
may I attain and persevere in solitude;
by the force of a place of seclusion,
may I attain a mystic’s isolation
of body, speech, and mind.
May I be blessed by the mountains of solitude.
