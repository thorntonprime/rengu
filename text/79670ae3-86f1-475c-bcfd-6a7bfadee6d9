Title: Radiant in Its Sheath
Description: April 8
---
Outside everyoneâ€™s house is a great force that will someday attack.

Many have been carried off, held for some kind of ransom, mortally
wounded, or made crazed.

Who would raise a child and not prepare him for such an imminent
battle?

Who would ever write a book and not in some way make you aware of a
strong opponent you will meet?

A sword is most effective if it is never raised, but can turn radiant
in its sheath

and reflect a light onto your face that can still the anger in others.
