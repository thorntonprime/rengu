The objects of sense in the worid ever changing --
85 These we adhere to as things of reality;
But in the ocean of birth and death, they drown us.
How long shall we wander in this path of dreams?
This world to us indeed seems permanent and fixed,
Yet after all, what is it but a road of dreams
To which life after life we must perforce return?
