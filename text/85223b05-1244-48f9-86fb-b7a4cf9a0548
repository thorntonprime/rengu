Title: A Coat Rack
Description: June 8
---
Let this page be a coat rack you leave something on.

Something that you will be better off without. Something that if you no longer
  carry its weight

you will look less cunning and dangerous, less inclined to explode.

And you will know more mirth if a thorn in your mind you let me keep; a
  pin-cushion my being, why not, for you?

Then the scent of your love will reach others and help draw them from their
  places of hiding,

their shields they wonâ€™t need anymore to veil, to hold between our embrace.

The world will be known as more miraculous, tender, fun and always giving,

and your hands, angel, will then too be able to carry more of God off,
  wherever you like to go.

You could set Him all around in places that you wish Him found.
