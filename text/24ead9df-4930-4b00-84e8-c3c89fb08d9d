Title: Hymn to R창 when He Riseth
---
Homage to thee, O thou who art R창 when thou risest and Temu when thou
settest. Thou risest, thou risest, thou shinest, thou shinest, thou
who art crowned king of the gods. Thou art the lord of heaven, the
lord of earth; the creator of those who dwell in the heights and of
those who dwell in the depths. (Thou art) the God One who came into
being in the beginning of time. Thou didst create the earth, thou
didst fashion man, thou didst make the watery abyss of the sky, thou
didst form H창pi (the god of the Nile), thou didst create the watery
abyss, and thou dost give life unto all that therein is. Thou hast
knit together the mountains, thou hast made mankind and the beasts of
the field to come into being, thou hast made the heavens and the
earth. Worshipped be thou whom the goddess Ma창t embraceth at morn and
at eve. Thou dost travel across the sky with heart swelling with joy
Hail, thou Disk, lord of beams of light, thou risest and thou makest
all mankind to live. Grant thou that I may behold thee at dawn each
day.
