It is only a few more days, in this world, and each shall return to its own
fountain; the blood-drop to the abysmal heart, and the water to the river, and
the river to the shining sea; and the dewdrop which fell from heaven shall rise
to heaven again, shaking off the dust grains which weighed it down, thawed from
the earth frost which chained it here to herb and sward, upward and upward ever
through stars and suns, through gods, and through the parents of the gods,
purer and purer through successive lives, until it enters the Nothing, which is
the All, and finds its home at last.
