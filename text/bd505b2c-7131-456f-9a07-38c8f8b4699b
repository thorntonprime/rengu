As the Pythagoreans and Platonists believe, during the whole time the sublime
Soul lives in this base body, our mind, as though it were ill, is thrown into
a continual disquiet -- here and there, up and down -- and is always asleep
and delirious; and the individual movements, actions, passions of men are
nothing but vértigos of the sick, dreams of the sleeping, deliriums of the
insane, so that Euripides rightly called this life the dream of a shadow. But
while all are deceived, usually those are less deceived who at some time, as
happens occasionally during sleep, become suspicious and say to themselves：
‘Perhaps those things are not true which now appear to us; perhaps we are now
dreaming.’ Whoever among the dreamers is so affected is in comparison to the
others, as Tiresias is said by Homer to be, among the shadows. He alone is
wise, the poet says; but all the others fly about like shadows, or rather fly
about as shadows.
