God must become man, man must become God; heaven must become one thing
with the earth, the earth must be turned to heaven： If you will make
heaven out of the earth, then give the earth the heaven’s food, that
the earth may obtain the will of heaven, that the will of the wrathful
Mercury may give itself in unto the will of the heavenly Mercury.

But what wilt thou do? Wilt thou introduce the poisonful Mercury
(which has only a death’s will in itself) into the temptation, as the
false magus does?  Will you send one devil to another, and make an
angel of him? In deed and in truth I must needs laugh at such folly：
If thou wilt keep a corrupt black devil, how dost thou think to turn
the earth by the devil to heaven? Is not God the creator of all
beings? Thou must eat of God’s bread, if thou wilt transmute thy body
out of the earthly property into the heavenly.
