Silent sunlight welcome in, there is work I must now begin,
All my dreams have blown away.
And the children wait to play,
They'll soon remember things to do,
When the heart is young and the night is done and the sky is blue.

Morning song bird sail away,
Lend a tune to another day,
Bring your wings and choose a roof,
Sing a song of love and truth.

We'll soon remember if you do,
When all things were tall,
And our friends were small,
And the world was new.

Sleepy horses heave away,
Put your backs to the golden hay,
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done,
For your work has just begun.

Ther'll be the evening in the end,
But till that time arrives,
You can rest your eyes,
And begin again.

Silent sunlight
Morning sun
Silent sunlight welcome in.
