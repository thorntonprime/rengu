Title: Word Spreads about Good Cooking
Description: January 23
---
The movements of our hands help build the Unseen.

We add to the universe by our efforts. Whatever we do, we should never
think it is irrelevant;

whatever we do, we should not conclude it is so important either.
Between those two

poles find your balance; between those two regions your talents will
bloom.

Word spreads about good cooking. Become that, an exquisite meal for
us.

The alchemy stone is waiting to retire and confessâ€¦ something in us is
its power.
