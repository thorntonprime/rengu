On the Day of Judgement Hell will swallow all the Damned and together
with them everything in the whole World that is putrid and stinking,
and the Maw of the Abyss will close upon their Heads; neither Man nor
Demon nor Creature else will evermore go forth.  The Issues will be
sealed, and eternal Despair will do its eternal Work.
