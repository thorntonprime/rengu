In the beginning of creation, the core of the Shekhinah was in the lower
regions. And because the Shekhinah was below, heaven and earth were one
and in perfect harmony. The wellsprings and the channels through which
everything in the higher regions flows into the lower were still active,
complete and unhindered, and thus God filled everything from above to below.
But when Adam came and sinned, the order of things was turned into disorder,
and the heavenly channels were broken.
