God ... so copied forth himself into the whole life and energy of man’s
soul, as that the lovely characters of Divinity may be most easily seen
and read of all men within themselves The impresse of souls is ...
nothing but God himself, who could not write his own name so as that it
might be read, but only in rational natures.
