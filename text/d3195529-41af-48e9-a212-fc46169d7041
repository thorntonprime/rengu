Adam was both man and woman and yet neither one nor the other but a virgin,
full of chastity and modesty and purity, such was the image of God; he had
in himself the two principles of fire and light, and in their conjunction
was found his love of himself, his virginal principle, which was the
beautiful garden of pleasure planted with roses in which he loved himself;
it is what we shall be at the resurrection of the dead, as Christ teaches us,
saying that we shall no longer marry nor be given in marriage, but shall
be as the angels of God ... and yet not only pure spirits like the angels,
but clothed in a glorious body in which reposes the spiritual and angelic
body. ...

If God had created him in the terrestrial life, perishable, miserable, naked,
sick, bestial and painful, He would not have introduced him into Paradise. If
He had desired that there be pregnancy and bestial reproduction, He would from
the beginning have created a man and a woman, and the two sexes would have
been separated at the ‘Verbum Fiat’ following the two principles, male and
female, as was the case with other terrestrial creatures.
