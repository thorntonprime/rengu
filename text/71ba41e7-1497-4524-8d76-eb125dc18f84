Thus the Lord Jesus in his spiritual Glories, as he is the Divine
Understanding, is the Original form of the Sun, the Suns Sun. To him
agrees that, which Plutarch delivereth to us from the ancient
Philosophers, that the God of the Sun, which inhabits the Sun, excels
the Sun in the sweetness, beauty, and glory of his Light, ten thousand
times more, than the Sun doth this Earth, or the darkest Cloud. The
Sun it self shining in these visible Heavens is the essence or
essential form, framed by this pattern, sprung forth from it. The
Light, the Sun-shines, and Suns which we severally take in our eyes,
are so many figures, and pictures, or shadows rather of this Sun
flowing from him.
