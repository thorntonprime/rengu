Hermes ... says that when God changed His form, the universe was suddenly
revealed and put forth in the Light of Actuality -- this world being nothing
but a visible Image of a Hidden God. This is what the Ancients meant when
they said that Pallas leapt forth in divine perfection from the forehead
of Jupiter, with the aid of Vulcan (or Divine Light).
