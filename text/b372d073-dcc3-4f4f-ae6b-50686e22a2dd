A Zen master named Gettan lived in the latter part of the
Tokugawa era. He used to say： "There are three kinds of
disciples： those who impart Zen to others, those who maintain
the temples and shrines, and then there are the rice bags and
the clothes-hangers."

Gasan expressed the same idea. When he was studying under
Tekisui, his teacher was very severe. Sometimes he even beat
him. Other pupils would not stand this kind of teaching and
quit. Gasan remained, saying： "A poor disciple utilizes a
teacher's influence. A fair disciple admires a teacher's
kindness. A good disciple grows strong under a teacher's
discipline."
