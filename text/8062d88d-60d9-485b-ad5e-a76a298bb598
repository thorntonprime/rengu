That we may be constant in prayer, so must we be faithful to do all
our business the whole day through with such a steadiness that nothing
may make us wavering.

This prayer, which is performed in outward business, is a fruit of the
inward prayer or Prayer of Silence. It is like the heat of a stove,
which holds long though you put no more wood in; it is the anointing
of prayer; it is the smell of the precious incense which has spread
itself abroad; it is a hidden taste of the heavenly manna wherewith we
are fed; it is a cooling and refreshing of the water which we have
drunk; it is an impression of the Love and Presence of God in the
heart itself which is continued in the performing of our business, and
which serves to call a man back to his inward business when he has
been scattered outwardly. And instead of suffering the mind to rove,
when we rise up from inward prayer which is performed at set times, we
should rather take care to preserve what we have therein received as a
precious powerful water which we must be careful not to let evaporate.
