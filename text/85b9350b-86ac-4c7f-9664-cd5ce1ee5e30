It is true that there is something which terrifies the eye and
surprises the soul to find that Mother Nature, with her great skill
and wisdom and energy, has suddenly produced a thing like a stone cave
or a blessed spot. But I have often stared casually at little things
of this universe -- a bird, a fish, a flower, or a small plant, and
even at a bird’s feather, a fish’s scale, a flower petal and a blade
of grass -- and realized how Mother Nature has also created it with
all her great skill and wisdom and energy. As it is said that the lion
uses the same energy to attack an elephant as to attack a wild rabbit,
so does Mother Nature truly do the same thing. She uses all her energy
in producing a stone cave or a blessed spot, but she also uses all her
energy in producing a bird, a fish, a flower, a blade of grass, or
even a feather, a scale, a petal, a leaf. Therefore, it is not alone
the stone cave or the blessed spot that terrifies the eye and
surprises the soul in this world.
