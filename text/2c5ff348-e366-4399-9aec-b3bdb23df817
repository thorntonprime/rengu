There will be a time when this body will require four people to carry
it with difficulty (to the cremation ground) but at this moment we are
carrying this heavy burden ourselves by reason of the sustaining force
of the sense of ‘I’ which we have in it. It will be clearly seen that
somebody other than the body is necessary to entertain this sense of ‘I’
in it, to sustain it by its force and to carry its weight.
