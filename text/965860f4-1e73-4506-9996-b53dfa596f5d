Near me is my God. who is eternal, who is the true lover, in whom are
delight and satisfaction, and in whom is all wealth. All the time has
this wealth immeasurable been beside me. But I left my Lord, and like
a fool I courted man. who can never satisfy my desires, who. on the
other hand, causes misery, fear, disease, grief, and delusion.
