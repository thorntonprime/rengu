While we sojourn here our faith can continually increase as can also
charity. Each it is true is in such a degree that at a given moment
and given his nature he may not be in another; but while he is in one
degree he is in potency to another, though never in potency to the
infinite charity of Christ. But we must, by the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ work to actualize our total possibility, and to move from
virtue to virtue and from degree to degree, by him who is faith and
charity. Of ourselves, as ourselves, we can without him do nothing.
But all that we can do. we can do in him who alone can make up for our
deficiencies, that in the day of resurrection we may be found to be
integral and noble members of him.  Believing and loving with all our
power, we can confidently beg of Him this grace of increased faith and
charity, in tireless prayer approaching His throne with great trust.
For He is infinitely merciful and loving and permits none to be
defrauded of His holy desire.
