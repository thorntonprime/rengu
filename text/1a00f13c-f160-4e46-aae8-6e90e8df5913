Title: Just Looking for Trouble
---
I once had a student who would sit alone

in his house at night shivering with anxiety and fear.

And come morning, he would often look as though he had been raped by a
ghost.

Then one day my compassion crafted him a knife from my own divine
sword.

Since then, I have become very proud of this student.

For now, come evening, not only has he lost all his apprehensions;

now he goes out just looking for trouble.
