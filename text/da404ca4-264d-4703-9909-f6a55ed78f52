The third grade of love is when the mind of man is rapt into the abyss of
divine light, so that, utterly oblivious of all exterior things, it knows not
itself and passes wholly into its God. And so in this state is held in check
and lulled to sleep the crowd of carnal desires. In this state while the mind
is alienated from itself, while it is rapt unto the secret closet of the divine
primacy, while it is on all sides encircled by the conflagration of divine
love, and is intimately penetrated and set on fire through and through, it
strips off self and puts on a certain divine condition, and being configured to
the beauty gazed upon it passes into a new kind of glory.
