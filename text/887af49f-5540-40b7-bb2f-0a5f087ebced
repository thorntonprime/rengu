All good men are united with God through means. These means are the
grace of God, and the sacraments of Holy Church, and the Divine
virtues, faith, hope and charity, and a virtuous life according to the
commandments of God; and to these there belongs a death to sin and to
the world and to every inordinate lust of nature. And through these,
we remain united with Holy Church, that is, with all good men; and
with these, we obey God, and are one will with Him, even as an orderly
convent is united with its Superiorï¼š and without this union none can
please God nor be saved.
