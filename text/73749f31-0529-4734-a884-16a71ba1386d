What makes the wings return in the spring,
I know all about.

And what makes them leave again before the
snow weighs down their need for flight? That
feeling too I am very familiar with.

Look at your own migration from spirit to
form and back, so many times.

What is there to learn before you can retire
and cease such an arduous journey?

Even His son was here to sweat and fast, and
to work with his hands, and draw from a well
and quench the thirst of myriad shapes.

Until you discover heaven nests in your palm,
you will keep traveling in widening circles,

in exploration from spirit to form, until there
is that deep Ahhh inside, and then nowhere
else you will want to go.

Students then might gather, wanting to imbibe
your ways.
