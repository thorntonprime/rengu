Descrption: Bengali Hymn to Kâlî
Format: Verse
---
Because Thou lovest the Burning-ground,
I have made a Burning-ground of my heart --
That Thou, Dark One, haunter of the Burning-ground,
Mayest dance Thy eternal dance.
Nought else is within my heart, O Mother：
Day and night blazes the funeral pyre：
The ashes of the dead, strewn all about.
I have preserved against Thy coming;
With death-conquering Mahakala neath Thy feet
Do Thou enter in. dancing Thy rhythmic dance.
That I may behold Thee with closed eyes.
