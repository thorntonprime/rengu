Thou shalt loathe and be weary with all that thing that worketh in thy mind
and in thy will, unless it be only God. For otherwise surely, whatsoever it
be, it is betwixt thee and thy God. And no wonder if thou loathe and hate to
think on thyself, when thou shalt always feel sin a foul stinking lump, thou
knowest never what, betwixt thee and thy God： the which lump is none other
thing than thyself. For thou shalt think it oned and congealed with the
substance of thy being： yea, as it were without separation.

And therefore break down all knowing and feeling of all manner of creatures;
but most busily of thyself. For on the knowing and the feeling of thyself
hangeth the knowing and the feeling of all other creatures.
