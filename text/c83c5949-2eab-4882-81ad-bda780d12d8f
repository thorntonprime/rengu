Title: Once a Young Woman Said to Me
Description: January 31
---
Once a young woman said to me, “Hafiz, what is the sign of someone who
knows God?”

I became very quiet, and looked deep into her eyes, then replied,

“My dear, they have dropped the knife. Someone who knows God has
dropped the cruel knife

that most so often use upon their tender self and others.”
