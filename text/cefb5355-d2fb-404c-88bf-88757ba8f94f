By: Mechthild of Magdeburg

Undisciplined love dwells in the senses for it is still entangled with earthly
things. ...  Disciplined love lives in the soul and rises above the human
senses and forbids the body its own will. It is modest and very still. It folds
its wings and listens to an unspeakable voice and gazes into incomprehensible
light and seeks eagerly the will of its Lord.
