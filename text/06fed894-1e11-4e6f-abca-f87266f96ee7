Title: Another Squirrel Tale
Description: May 28
---
With them being all around my house and even coming in at times,

how could I not have another squirrel caper to report?

What I wanted to say of them was, that I think they can give blessings. Surely
  they are like little angels nesting in trees, who like nuts.

I think they might even be able to foretell winning lottery numbers, or point
  out a good person to date, if you are lonely.

But you have to be kind to them, or they will never divulge they can talk.
