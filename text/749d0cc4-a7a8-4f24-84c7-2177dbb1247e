The hour is striking so close above me,
so clear and sharp,
that all my senses ring with it.
I feel it nowï¼š there's a power in me
to grasp and give shape to my world.

I know that nothing has ever been real
without my beholding it.
All becoming has needed me.
My looking ripens things
and they come toward me, to meet and be met.
