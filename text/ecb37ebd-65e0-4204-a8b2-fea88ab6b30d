Title: When ALl the Haggling Is Complete
Description: February 26
---
Don’t let that tame-looking lion fool you, that sweet old man over
there.

You think this is an arm and leg you see on me?

He ate those years ago, and crafted these illusions in their place.

I am talking about that guy, Attar, my master; I lived close to him
for forty years.

“Die before you die,” said the Prophet Muhammad. What do you think
that feels like?

It is no game for the fainthearted. It is living hell,

for there will be nothing left of you but a molten, bright sphere.

Seems a good trade though, a fantastic deal, when all the tough
haggling is complete.
