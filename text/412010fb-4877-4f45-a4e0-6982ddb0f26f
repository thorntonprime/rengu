Title: God, Dependent on Us
Description: May 4
---
Try and stay with me on this one： After being so connected to the well where
  all is drawn,

after absorbing God through a refulgent, pulsating chord at will as easily as
  most breathe,

curled there -- buoyant and surrounded in a warm sea, knowing your kingdom is
  light,

yes, having the Infinite rush through your veins at your merest of commands,

what bravery dear, what strength it takes to sometimes not openly scream

about such a stupendous loss, even though, if you listen, all the birds’ songs
  promise --

it is temporary, only temporary ... God not being connected to us in a profound
  intimacy.

You and God are dependent on each other’s being for life.

What else would you like to know today ... if that is not enough?
