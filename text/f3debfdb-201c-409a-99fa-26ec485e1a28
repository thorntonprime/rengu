‘(The sinner) who offends Me by counting on My mercy cannot in truth
say that he hopes for My mercy. But this presumption has nonetheless
sweetened the milk of mercy.  At the hour of death, if he recognizes
his sin, if he unburdens his conscience through holy confession, he is
then purified of presumption, which no longer offends Me, and mercy
remains with him.

‘By this mercy he can, if he wishes, gain hope. Without hope, no
sinner could escape despair, and through despair he would incur with
the demons eternal damnation For the sin of despair offends Me more
and is more mortal to (sinners) than all the other sins which they
have committed in the course of their existence.’
