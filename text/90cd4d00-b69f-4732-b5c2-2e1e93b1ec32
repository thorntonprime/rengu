A student of Tendai, a philosophical school of Buddhism, came to
the Zen abode of Gasan as a pupil. When he was departing a few
years later, Gasan warned him： "Studying the truth speculatively
is useful as a way of collecting preaching material. But
remember that unless you meditate constantly your light of truth
may go out."
