Maya is a very huge saw. Lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, jealousy,
hatred, egoism, etc., are the teeth of this huge saw. All worldy-minded
persons are caught up in the teeth of this saw and are crushed. Those who are
endowed with purity, humility, love, dispassion, devotion and enquiry are not
hurt. They escape through divine grace. They pass smoothly below the saw and
reach the other side of immortality.
