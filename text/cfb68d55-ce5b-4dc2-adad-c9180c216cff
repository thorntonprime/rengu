If you wish to escape the pains and afflictions inherent in the wheel
of deaths and rebirths (samsâra). you must devote yourself to
meditation; it is the path which leads to divinity. It is the royal
way to the kingdom of Brahman： it is the mysterious ladder which
goes from earth to heaven, from error to truth, from darkness to
light, from grief to joy.  from restlessness to peace, from ignorance
to knowledge, from death to immortality.  Meditation leads us towards
knowledge of the Self, that is to say. towards eternal peace and
supreme felicity. It prepares us for the integral experience of
direct intuitive knowledge.
