A Christ not in us is the same thing as a Christ not ours. If we are
only so far with Christ as to own and receive the history of His
birth, person, and character, if this is all that we have of Him, we
are as much without Him, as much left to ourselves, as little helped
by Him as those evil spirits which cried out, ‘We know thee who thou
art, the holy one of God.’
