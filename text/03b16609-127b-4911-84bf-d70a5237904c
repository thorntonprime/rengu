Twenty monks and one nun, who was named Eshun, were practicing
meditation with a certain Zen master.

Eshun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her
dress plain. Several monks secretly fell in love with her. One
of them wrote her a love letter, insisting upon a private
meeting.

Eshun did not reply. The following day the master gave a lecture
to the group, and when it was over, Eshun arose. Addressing the
one who had written to her, she saidï¼š "If you really love me so
much, come and embrace me now."
