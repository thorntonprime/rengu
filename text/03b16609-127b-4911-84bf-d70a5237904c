Twenty monks and one nun, who was named Eshun, were practicing
meditation with a certain Zen master.

Eshun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her
dress plain. Several monks secretly fell in love with her. One
of them wrote her a love letter, insisting upon a private
meeting.

Eshun did not reply. The following day the master gave a lecture
to the group, and when it was over, Eshun arose. Addressing the
one who had written to her, she said： "If you really love me so
much, come and embrace me now."
