Sin is a departure from the order to the end. ... Sin may occur in two ways in
the operation of art. First, by a departure from the particular end intended by
the artist, and this sin will be proper to the artï¼š e.g., if an artist produce
a bad thing, while intending to produce something good, or produce something
good, while intending to produce something bad. Secondly, by a departure from
the universal end of human life, and then he will be said to sin if he intend
to produce a bad work and does so in effect, so that another is deceived by it.
But this sin is not proper to the artist as an artist, but as a man.
Consequently, for the former sin the artist is blamed as an artist, while for
the latter he is blamed as a man. -- On the other hand, in moral matters, where
we take into consideration the order of reason to the universal end of human
life, sin and evil are always due to a departure from the order of reason to
the universal end of human life. Therefore man is Sin blamed for such a sin,
both as man and as a moral being.
