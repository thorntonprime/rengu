The Prince of mankind (Muhammad) said truly that no one who has passed
away from this world

Feels sorrow and regret for having died; nay, but he feels a hundred
regrets for having missed the opportunity.

Saying to himself, ‘Why did I not make death my object -- death which
is the store-house of all fortunes and riches ... ?'

The grief of the dead is not on account of death; it is because they
dwelt on the phenomenal forms of existence.
