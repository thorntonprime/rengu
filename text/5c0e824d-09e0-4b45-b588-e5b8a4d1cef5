What is it to me whether my neighbour is pleased with me or with another? the
joy is his; not the smallest share of it is mine. If happiness springs from
the joy of others, then I should have it in every event; so why am I not glad
when men rejoice to honour another?  ... Some loathe me; then why shall I
rejoice in being praised? Some praise me; then why shall I be cast down by
blame?

Living beings are of diverse character; not even the Conquerors can content
them, much less simple souls such as I. Then why think of the world? They
blame a fellow-creature who gains naught, they scorn him who gains something;
being thus by nature unpleasant companions, what happiness can come from
them?
