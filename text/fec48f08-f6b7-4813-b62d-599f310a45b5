Quicksilver is the mother of all metals, on account of its coldness
and moistness; and if it be once purified and cleansed of all foreign
matter it cannot be mixed any more with grossness of any kind, neither
can it be changed back into an imperfect metal. For Nature does not
undo her work, and that which has once become perfectly pure can never
become impure again.
