Those living souls who place their reliance on worldly objects can
never taste true felicity. As is the desire or thought in the mind, so
is the soul born in its next incarnation. ... The mind delights itself
with the thoughts of desired objects; then, itself assimilating their
natures, it takes on the same form as the one in which it delights.
