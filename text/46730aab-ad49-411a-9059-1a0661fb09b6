When I perceive that I am earth and cinders or whatever is still more
worthless, it is just then that I have confidence to come before Thee,
when I am humbled, cast down to the clay, reduced to such an elemental
state, as seems not even to exist.  And the watchful pen of Moses has
recorded this my soul's condition in his memorial of me.  For Abraham,
he says, drew near and said, ‘Now I have begun to speak to the Lord,
and I am earth and ashes’, since it is just when he knows his own
nothingness that the creature should come into the presence of his
Maker.
