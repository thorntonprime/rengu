Title: Inside a Country Dialect
Description: June 2
---
A human being is like the rod
Moses held or the words
that Jesus said.

The outer is just a piece of wood,
or mouth-sounds of a country dialect,
whose inner parts can divide
the green ocean and make the dead
sit up and smile.

You see the far-off tents
of an encampment. You go closer.

There is a dust-shape, someone walking near.
Inside that, a man, bright eyes
and the strength of his presence.

When Moses returns from the wilderness
where he has gone alone,
Mount Sinai begins to dance.
