If a man understands the design of God by which all things are ordained, he
will despise all material things, and his vices will be healed; but when
folly and ignorance continue, all the vices grow in strength, and lacerate
the soul with incurable sores; and infected and corrupted by the poison, the
soul breaks out in tumours, so to speak, save in the case of those whose
souls are cured by the sovereign remedy of knowledge and intelligence.
