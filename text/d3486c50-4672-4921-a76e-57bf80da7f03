O Man! The Divine Image was thy proper Habitation. This Image in thy Person
was a Sun of Beauty shining in every part of it; and a Shield of Power
defending it on every side.  In this Image all Blessed things were united
to make a Paradise for thee, which thou didst carry about in thine own
Person, as thy proper Form, thine inseparable Habitation, like to God, who
carryeth his own Heaven into every place with him.
