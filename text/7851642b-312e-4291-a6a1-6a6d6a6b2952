In the beginning, before there was any division of subject and object, there
was one existence, Brahman alone, One without a second. That time is called
the Krita yuga, or the golden age, when people skilled in knowledge and
discrimination realized that one existence. ... Men had but one caste, known
as Hamsa. All were equally endowed with knowledge, all were bom knowers of
Truth; and since this was so the age was called Krita, which is to say,
‘Attained’.
