Title: Sheltered by the Sun
Description: March 22

Look what can grow from one shaft in a field, or from one shaft like a
human being.

Beautiful cities can rise in our minds or be burned there to the
ground.

We can become so ripe ... schools and buildings can be named after us,
and things we have written may come to be spoken in several tongues.

What does love care about any fame? Not a thing!

But love does not mind any attention it gets either, if that attention
increases the capacity to give.

Love does not mind that place where it camped for a while in a
physical form or where that body may come to rest,

and may even then be revered if that body became a unique
shelter/nourishment for others.

That is what greatness doesï¼š kindly leaves a shelter for us to gather
under, where more nourishment can be offered to all things.
