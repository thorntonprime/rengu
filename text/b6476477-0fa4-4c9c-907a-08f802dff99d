Therefore, both wealth and poverty are Divine gifts： wealth is corrupted by
forgetfulness, poverty by covetousness. Both conceptions are excellent, but
they differ in practice.  Poverty is the separation of the heart from all but
God, and wealth is the preoccupation of the heart with that which does not
admit of being qualified. When the heart is cleared (of all except God),
poverty is not better than wealth nor is wealth better than poverty. Wealth
is abundance of worldly goods and poverty is lack of them： all goods belong
to God： when the seeker bids farewell to property, the antithesis disappears
and both terms are transcended.
