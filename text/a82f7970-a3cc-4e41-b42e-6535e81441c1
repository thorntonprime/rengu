Every creature is. as it were, ‘God-created’ or ‘finite-infinity’,
with the result that no creature's existence could be better than it
is. ... God in His infinite goodness gives being to all in the way in
which each can receive it. With Him there is no jealousy; He
communicates being without distinction; and, since all receive being
in accord with the demands of their contingent nature, every creature
rests content in its own perfection, which God has freely bestowed
upon it. None desires the greater perfection of any other; each loves
by preference that perfection which God has given it and strives to
develop and preserve it intact.
