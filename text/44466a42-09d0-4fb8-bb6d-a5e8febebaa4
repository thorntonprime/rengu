Title: The Quintessence of Loneliness
---
I am like a heroin addict in my longing for a sublime state, for that
ground of Conscious Nothing where the Rose ever blooms.

O, the Friend has done me a great favor and so thoroughly ruined my
life; what else would you expect seeing God would do!

Out of the ashes of this broken frame there is a noble rising son
pining for death, because since we first met, Beloved,

I have become a foreigner to every world except that one in which
there is only You -- or Me.

Now that the heart has held that which can never be touched, my
subsistence is a blessed desolation, and from that I cry for more
loneliness.

I am lonely. I am so lonely, dear Beloved, for the quintessence of
loneliness. For what is more alone than God?

Hafiz, what is more pure and alone, what is as magnificently sovereign
as God?
