For we can unsuppose Heaven and Earth and annihilate the world in our
imagination, but the place where they stood will remain behind, and we cannot
unsuppose or annihilate that, do what we can. Which without us is the chamber
of our infinite treasures, and within us the repository and recipient of them.
