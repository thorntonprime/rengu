The old nature is destroyed, dissolved, decomposed, and, in a longer or
shorter period of time, transmuted into something else. Such a man is so well
digested and melted in the fire of affliction that he despairs of his own
strength and looks for help and comfort to the mercy of God alone. In this
furnace of the Cross, a man, like earthly gold, attains to the true black
Raven’s Head, i.e., loses all beauty and reputation in the eyes of the
world： and that not only during forty days and nights, or forty years, but
often during his whole life, which is thus often more full of sorrow and
suffering than of comfort and joy.
