Title: The Pull of Reality
Format: verse
---
Reality is what grabs hold of you
and pulls you away from mere things.

Reality is not what makes you blind
      and deaf
and causes you to cling more tightly.

The spiritually blind imagine things
that only increase their suffering;
the fancies of selflessness
are what come to the eyes of
      visionaries.
