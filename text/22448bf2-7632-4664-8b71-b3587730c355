All things stand in the will, and everything, animate or inanimate, is
the effect and produce of that will, which worketh in it and formeth
it to be that which it is. And every will, wherever found, is the
birth and effect of some antecedent will, for will can only proceed
from will, till you come to the first working will, which is God
Himself.
