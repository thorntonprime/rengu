Harkee, all rational souls! The swiftest steed to bear you to your goal is
suffering; none shall ever taste eternal bliss but those who stand with
Christ in depths of bitterness.  Nothing is more gall-bitter than suffering,
nothing so honey-sweet as to have suffered. The most sure foundation for this
perfection is humility, for he whose nature here creeps in deepest depths
shall soar in spirit to highest height of Deity; for joy brings sorrow and
sorrow brings joy.
