0 ye Compassionate Ones, ye possess the wisdom of understanding, the
love of compassion, the power of (doing) divine deeds and of
protecting, in incomprehensible measure. Ye Compassionate Ones,
(such-and-such a person) is passing from this world to the world
beyond. He is leaving this world. He is taking a great leap.  No
friends (hath he).  Misery is great. (He is without) defenders,
without protectors, without forces and kinsmen.  The light of this
world hath set. He goeth to another place. He entereth thick darkness.
He falleth down a steep precipice. He entereth into a jungle solitude.
He is pursued by Karmic forces. He goeth into the Vast Silence. He is
borne away by the Great Ocean. He is wafted on the Wind of Karma. He
goeth in the direction where stability existeth not. He is caught by
the Great Conflict. He is obsessed by the Great Afflicting Spirit. He
is awed and terrified by the Messengers of the Lord of Death. Existing
Karma putteth him into repeated existence. No strength hath he. He
hath come upon a time when he hath to go alone.

O ye Compassionate Ones, defend (so-and-so) who is defenceless.
Protect him who is unprotected. Be his forces and his kinsmen. Protect
(him) from the great gloom of the Bardo. Turn him from the red (or
storm) wind of Karma. Turn him from the great awe and terror of the
Lords of Death.
