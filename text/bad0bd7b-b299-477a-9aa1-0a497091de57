Title: Batting 900
Description: January 4
---
I once walked around with a sign on my back. The reason for this was

that upon analysis I came to the conclusion that about 90% of what
anyone had to say was some kind of sales pitch.

So whenever anyone would start to talk to me I would just turn around
and let them read my written reply, my sign, which said ...

Nothing Doing.

Nine times out of ten I was right. Who goes through life as well as
that ... batting 900!
