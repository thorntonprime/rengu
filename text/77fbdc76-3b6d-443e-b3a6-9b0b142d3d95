Lovers work,
so that when body and soul are no longer together,
their loving will be free.

Wash in wisdom-water,
so you will have no regrets about the time here.

Love is the vital core of the soul,
and of all you see, only love is infinite.

Your nonexistence before you were born
is the sky in the east.

Your death is the western horizon,
with you here between.
Your way leads neither east nor west, but in.

Test your love-wings and make them strong.
Forget the idea of religious ladders.
Love is the roof. Your senses are waterspouts.

Drink rain directly off the roof.
Waterspouts are easily damaged
and often must be replaced.

Say this poem in your chest.
Do not worry how it sounds going through your mouth.

A human body is a bow.
Breathing and speech are arrows.

When quiver and arrows are used up or lost,
there is nothing more for a bow to do.
