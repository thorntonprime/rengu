    Title: Drinking Alone under the Moon

A pot of wine amidst the flowers,
Alone I drink sans company.
The moon I invite as drinking friend,
And with my shadow we are three.
The moon, I see, she does not drink,
My shadow only follows me;
I’ll keep them company a while
For spring’s the time for gayety.

I sing： the moon she swings her head;
I dance： my shadow swells and sways.
We sport together while awake,
While drunk, we all go our own ways.
An eternal, speechless trio then.
Till in the clouds we meet again!
