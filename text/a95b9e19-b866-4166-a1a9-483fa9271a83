Noble desires do not easily come to the soul. Know this： those who have
them, have them by a special grace of God. In this world of Mâyâ, men receive
innumerable blows and suffer unimaginable misfortunes; however, they do not
want to change their orientation. It is strange, they go back each time to
the same situation, only to receive blow after blow.  And if someone gives
them good advice, they become offended.
