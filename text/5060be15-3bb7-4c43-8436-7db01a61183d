The Eternal Father of All Things, being not less wise in the ordering,
than powerful in the creation, of the world, has made the whole
Universe to cohere by means of secret influences and mutual subjection
and obedience, things below being analogous to things above, and vice
versa; so that both ends of the world are nevertheless united by a
real bond of natural cohesion.
