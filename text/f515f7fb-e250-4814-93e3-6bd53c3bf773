This (elemental soul) (bhûtâtman), verily, is overcome by Nature’s (prakrti)
qualities (guna).

Now, because of being overcome, he goes on to confusedness; because of
confusedness, he sees not the blessed Lord (prabhu), the causer of action,
who stands within oneself (âtma-stha). Borne along and defiled by the stream
of qualities, unsteady, wavering, bewildered, full of desire, distracted,
this one goes on to the state of self-conceit (abhimânatva). In thinking
‘This is I’ and ‘That is mine’, he binds himself with his self, as does a
bird with a snare.
