Title: Everything I Have Is Also Yours
Description: December 26
---
There are so many gifts still unopened from your birthday. There are
so many hand-crafted presents that have been sent to your door by God.

The Beloved does not mind repeating, “Everything I have is also
yours.”

So forgive Hafiz and the Friend if we break into a sweet laughter when
your heart complains of being thirsty. ... when ages ago, every cell
in your body capsized forever into His infinite golden sea.

A lover’s pain is like holding one’s breath too long in the middle of
a vital performance, in the middle of one of Creation’s favorite
songs.

Indeed, a lover’s pain is this sleeping, this sleeping when God just
rolled over and gave you such a big good-morning smooch.

There are so many gifts still unopened from your soul’s birthday.
There are so many hand-crafted presents that have been sent into your
life by God.

And the Beloved does not mind at all repeating,

“Everything I have is also yours.”
