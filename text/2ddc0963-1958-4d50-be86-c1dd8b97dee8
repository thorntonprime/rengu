Do not fondly imagine that God, when he created the heavens and the earth
and all creatures, made one thing one day and another the next. Moses
describes it thus it is true, nevertheless he knew better： he did so
merely on account of those who are incapable of understanding or
conceiving otherwise. All God did was： he willed and they were.
