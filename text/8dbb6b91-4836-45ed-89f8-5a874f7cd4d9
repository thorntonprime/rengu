Title: Basically Useless
Description: March 10
---
They were happier, all the mouths I saw in a certain city.

For they all woke up one day and mostly forgot what they were for
besides ... just kissing.

And in between their rounds of sweet romantic play, they -- all those
mouths,

appeared to have few lingering impulses, except for a little food.

That is -- talking, everyone came to realize, was basically useless.
