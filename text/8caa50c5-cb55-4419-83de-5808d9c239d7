Thus shall the Day of Judgement beï¼š
(A day) whereon is neither sun, nor moon, nor stars;
neither clouds, nor thunder, nor lightning;
neither wind, nor rain-storm, nor cloud-rack;
neither darkness, nor evening, nor morning;
neither summer, nor autumn, nor winter;
neither heat, nor frost, nor cold;
neither hail, nor rain, nor dew;
neither noon, nor night, nor dawn;
neither shining, nor brightness, nor light,

save only the splendour of the brightness of the Most High, whereby
all shall be destined to see what has been determined (for them).
