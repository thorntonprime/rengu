There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
renown.

And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.

And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.

And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the earth ; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
