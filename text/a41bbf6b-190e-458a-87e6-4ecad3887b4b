Impermanence plunges us into the depth of all Being. And so all forms of the
present are not to be taken and bound in time, but held in a larger context of
meaning in which we participate. I don't mean this in a Christian sense (from
which I ever more passionately distance myself) but in a sheer earthly, deep
earthly, sacred earthly consciousnessï¼š that what we see here and now is to
bring us into a wider -- indeed, the very widest -- dimension. Not in an
afterlife whose shadow darkens the earth, but in a whole that is the whole.
