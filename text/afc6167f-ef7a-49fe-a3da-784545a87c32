Dear Reader, if thou wouldst be lead to that Sea, which is as the gathering
together, and confluence of all the waters of Life, of all Truths, Goodness,
Joys, Beauties and Blessedness; follow the stream of the Divine Love, as it
holdeth on its course, ... bearing thee up in the bright Arms of its own Divine
Power, sporting with thee all along, washing thee white as snow in its own pure
floods, and bathing thy whole Spirit and Person in heavenly unexpressible
sweetness.
