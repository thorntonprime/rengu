A nun who was searching for enlightenment made a statue of
Buddha and covered it with gold leaf. Wherever she went she
carried this golden Buddha with her.

Years passed and, still carrying her Buddha, the nun came to
live in a small temple in a country where there were many
Buddhas, each one with its own particular shrine.

The nun wished to burn incense before her golden Buddha. Not
liking the idea of the perfume straying to the others, she
devised a funnel through which the smoke would ascend only to
her statue. This blackened the nose of the golden Buddha, making
it especially ugly.
