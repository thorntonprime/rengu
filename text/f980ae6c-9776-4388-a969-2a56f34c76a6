I want to ask you, as clearly as I can, to bear with patience all that
is unresolved in your heart, and try to love the questions themselves,
as if they were rooms yet to enter or books written in a foreign
language. Don't dig for answers that can't be given you yetï¼š you live
them now. For everything must be lived. Live the questions now,
perhaps then, someday, you will gradually, without noticing, live into
the answer.
