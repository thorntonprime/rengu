There are two patterns eternally set before men; the one blessed and
divine, the other godless and wretchedï¼š but they do not see them, or
perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they are growing
like the one and unlike the other, by reason of their evil deeds; and
the penalty is, that they lead a life answering to the pattern which
they are growing like. And if we tell them, that unless they depart
from their cunning, the place of innocence will not receive them after
death; and that here on earth, they will live ever in the likeness of
their own evil selves, and with evil friends -- when they hear this
they in their superior cunning will seem to be listening to the talk
of idiots.
