If one cannot realize the topsy-turvy-ness and topsy-turvy-ness again
of the technique of hsiian (mysterious), how can he understand that it
is possible to cultivate lotus flowers in an atmosphere of fire? Bring
the White Tiger back home whereby it is fed. A glittering pearl will
be born which has a shape as round as the moon. Watch with care the
fire and the season of the medicinal pot, and let whatever happens
occur naturally and without hurry. The tan (medicine) will ripen at
the moment when all of the yin is eliminatedâ€”and (by this achievement
a man) can escape out of the cage (of death) with a life of ten
thousand years.
