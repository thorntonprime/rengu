They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than
Satan, a rebel

Whom Allâh cursed, and he said： Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an
appointed portion,

And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires
in them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle’s
ears, and surely I will command them and they will change Allâh’s
creation. Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of Allâh is verily
a loser and his loss is manifest.

He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them, and Satan promiseth
them only to beguile
