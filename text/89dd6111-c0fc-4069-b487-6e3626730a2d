If (the love of God) but once kindle a fire within thee, my son, thou
shalt then certainly feel how it consumeth all that which it toucheth;
thou shalt feel it in the burning up thyself, and swiftly devouring
all egoity, or that which thou callest I and Me, as standing in a
separate root, and divided from the Deity, the fountain of thy being.
And when this enkindling is made in thee, then the love doth so
exceedingly rejoice in thy fire, as thou wouldst not for all the world
be out of it; yea, wouldst rather suffer thyself to be killed, than to
enter into thy something again. This fire now must grow hotter and
hotter, till it shall have perfected its office with respect to thee,
and therefore wilt not give over, till it come to the seventh degree.
Its flame hence also will be so very great, that it will never leave
thee, though it should even cost thee thy temporal life; but it would
go with thee in its sweet loving fire into death; and if thou wentest
also into hell, it would break hell in pieces also for thy sake.
Nothing is more certain than this; for it is stronger than death and
hell.
