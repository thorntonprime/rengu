Die, then, to the creatures, by God’s leave, and to your passions, by
His command, and you will then be worthy to be the dwelling-place of
the knowledge of God. The sign of your death to the creatures is that
you detach yourself from them and do not look for anything from them.
The sign that you have died to your passions is that you no longer
seek benefit for yourself, or to ward off injury, and you are not
concerned about yourself, for you have committed all things unto God.
The sign that your will has been merged in the Divine Will is that you
seek nothing of yourself or for yourself -- God’s Will is working in
you. Give yourself up into the hands of God, like the ball of the
polo-player, who sends'ft to and fro with his mallet, or like the dead
body in the hands of the one who washes it, or like the child in its
mother’s bosom.
