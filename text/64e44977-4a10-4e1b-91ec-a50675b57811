Title: Watch Out for Spiritual La-La Land
Description: January 17
---
Watch out for spiritual la-la land, where you might wind up comatose.
Some early warning signs are：

A. You start wearing all orange or white and count your beads in
public.

B. You chant something mysterious in Sanskrit or some language from
another planet while burning incense that (unknown to you) is laced
with potent hash, that makes you think you are on the right track when
naked devas start appearing.

C. You start believing some basically regular guy or gal with dreamy
eyes -- who parrots wisdom -- is a saint.

D. Even with those imaginary devas running around (who you would have
thought might have stimulated your lower chakras), your wife or
husband or lovers start to think： Gosh, what happened to my
sweetheart? We used to do it in the car, in traffic jams, behind our
tinted windows to pass the time constructively, and now look, yes, now
just look ... my sweetheart hasn’t gone down on me in three months,
and may never again.

E. Your high school graduating class pitches in for the best cult
deprogrammer in the world for you, as a birthday present. Especially
if you were a runner-up, or ever even remotely considered most likely
to succeed.
