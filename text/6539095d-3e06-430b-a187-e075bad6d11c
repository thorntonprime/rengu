Title: Go Screw Yourself
Description: June 7
---
Like a salesman who once scored at your house, the mirage keeps sending you
  offers.

The illusion, being persistent, used to knock at my door, so I began to shout,
  Go screw yourself!

That helped some, but maya did not finally go away until I sat for forty days
  in silence, and took full control over my life.

Now, just the turning of my head can send out a wake that shatters any phantom
  I wish.
