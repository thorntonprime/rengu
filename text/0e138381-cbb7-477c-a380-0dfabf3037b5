And so in the days when natural instincts prevailed, men moved quietly and
gazed steadily. At that time, there were no roads over mountains, nor boats,
nor bridges over water. All things were produced, each for its own proper
sphere. Birds and beasts multiplied; trees and shrubs grew up. The former
might be led by the hand; you could climb up and peep into the ravenâ€™s nest.
For then man dwelt with birds and beasts, and all creation was one. There
were no distinctions of good and bad men. Being all equally without knowledge,
their virtue could not go astray. Being all equally without evil desires,
they were in a state of natural integrity, the perfection of human existence.
