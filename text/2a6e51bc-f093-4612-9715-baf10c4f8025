Title: Every Holy Book
Description: January 28
---
A candle giving advice to the sun can make the sun smile because of
the flameâ€™s remarkable innocence.

Maybe I should be careful about saying something like this, but
every holy book ...

lifts the corners of my mouth, and even makes me giggle a bit.
