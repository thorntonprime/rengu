Trust not in Geomantie that superstitious Arte,
For God made Reason which there is set aparte.
Trust not to all Astrologers, I saie whie,
For that Arte is as secreat as Alkimy.
That other is disproved and plainely forbod,
By holy Saincts of the Church of God.
Trust not, ne love not Negromancy,
For it is a property of the Devill to lye.
  Trust to this Doctrine, set herein your desires,
  And now lerne the Regiment of your Fiers.
