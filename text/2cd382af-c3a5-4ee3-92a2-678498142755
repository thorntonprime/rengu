A husband and wife renounced the world and jointly undertook a pilgrimage to
various religious shrines. Once, as they were walking on a road, the husband,
being a little ahead of the wife, saw a piece of diamond on the road.
Immediately he scratched the ground to hide the diamond, thinking that, if
his wife saw it, she might perchance be moved by avarice and thus lose the
merit of her renunciation. While he was thus busy, the wife came up and asked
him what he was doing. In an apologetic tone he gave her an evasive reply.
She noticed the diamond, however, and reading his thoughts, asked him, ‘Why
have you left the world, if you still feel the difference between the diamond
and the dust?’
