This pearl of eternity is the Church or Temple of God within thee, the
consecrated place of divine worship, where alone thou canst worship
God in spirit and in truth. ... When once thou art well grounded in
this inward worship, thou wilt have learnt to live unto God above time
and place. For every day will be Sunday to thee, and wherever thou
goest thou wilt have a priest, a church, and an altar along with thee.
