Those filthy lusts and corruptions which men foment and entertain in their
minds, are the noisome vapours that ascend out of the bottomless pit; they
are the thick mists and fogs of hellish darkness arising in their souls, as
a preface and introduction of hell and death within. Where we find
uncleanness, intemperance, covetousness, or any such impure or unhallowed
behaviour, we may say. Here Satan’s throne is.

This sinful and corrupt nature being the true issue of hell itself, is
continually dragging down men's souls thither. All sin and wickedness in
man’s spirit hath the central force and energy of hell in it, and is
perpetually pressing down towards it, as towards its own place. There
needs no fatal necessity or astral impulses to tumble wicked men down
forcibly into hell： no, for sin itself, hastened by the mighty weight
of its own nature, carries them down thither with the most swift and
headlong motion.
