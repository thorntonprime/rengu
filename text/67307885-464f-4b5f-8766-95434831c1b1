Consequently the most perfect, faultless harmony cannot be perceived by the
ear, for it exists not in things sensible but only as an ideal conceived by the
mind. ... No man can hear it while still in the body, for it is wholly
spiritual and would draw to itself the essence of the soul, as infinite light
would attract all light to itself. Such infinitely perfect harmony, in
consequence, would be heard only in ecstasy by the ear of the intellect, once
the soul was free from the things of sense.
