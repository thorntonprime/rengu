An old Grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with anger at
a friend who had done him an injustice, "Let me tell you a story.

I too, at times, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so
much, with no sorrow for what they do.

But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is like
taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with
these feelings many times." He continued, "It is as if there are two
wolves inside me. One is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony
with all around him, and does not take offense when no offense was
intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the
right way.

But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest thing will
set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no
reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is
helpless anger,for his anger will change nothing.

Sometimes, it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for
both of them try to dominate my spirit."

The boy looked intently into his Grandfather's eyes and asked, "Which
one wins, Grandfather?"

The Grandfather smiled and quietly said, "The one I feed."
