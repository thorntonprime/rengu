It is a Spiritual Essence which is neither celestial nor infernal, but
an aerial, pure, and precious body, in the middle between the highest
and lowest, the choicest and noblest thing under heaven. But by the

of things. ... Men have it before their eyes, handle it with their
hands, yet know it not. though they constantly tread it under their
feet.
