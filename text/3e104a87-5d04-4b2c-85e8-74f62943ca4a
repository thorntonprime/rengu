All that we are by nature is in full contrariety to this divine love,
nor can it be otherwiseï¼š a death to itself is its only cure and
nothing else can make it subservient to good; just as darkness cannot
be altered or made better in itself or transmuted into light, it can
only be subservient to the light by being lost in it and swallowed up
by it.
