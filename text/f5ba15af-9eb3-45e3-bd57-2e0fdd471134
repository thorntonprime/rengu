  On the subject of myth and folklore, Coomaraswamy points out that when
  the Hero loses his immortal Bride, 'it remains for him to seek her out
  in that Otherworld or unknown City whence she first came, and of which
  the very name and place are strange to all those of whom he asks the
  way. for who knows "where" is overseas or underwave, or east of the
  sun or west of the moon, or "when" was once upon a time? The theme is
  infinitely varied but always the same story of ... a separation and a
  reunion, enchantment and disenchantment, fall and redemption' ('On the
  Loathly Bride-. Speculum, Oct.. 1945. p. 401).

Neither by taking ship, neither by any travel on foot.

To the Hyperborean Field shall thou find the wondrous way.
