Commentary: |
  According to a commentary, this passage dramatically suggests the
  metamorphosis from the central, vertical state of man to the
  peripheral, horizontal state of beast suffered by a being thrown back
  into the ‘round of existence’ -- which moreover is corroborated by the
  citations from Plato and Hermes directly below.

This Day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and
their feet bear witness as to what they used to earn.
