desert will become a garden, so be not grieved.

Do not turn your heart away, nor speak against your Beloved, but bear
your present state, and be not grieved.

Let your tender, wincing body and troubled mind be stilled; one day
desire for union will be fulfilled, so be not, O dear one, be not
grieved.

Behind the curtain a secret, wondrous game is being played, that you
know not, so do not give up, nor be dismayed, or grieved.

Once you have found the courage to set out for the Sun’s abode, do not
let any fears turn you from this sacred road, or be, or ever be much
grieved.

Maya will do her best to thwart your precious labor on this path, but
when you have a captain like Noah you will reach safe harbor, so be
not grieved.

The True Teacher is really the same as God, so don’t plague him with
petitions or clever complaints, but suff er gladly love’s paradox,
rules, trials and conditions, and my darling, O my darlings ...

yes, be not grieved.
