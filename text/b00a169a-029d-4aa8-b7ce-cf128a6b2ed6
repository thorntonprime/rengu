The mind is compared to quicksilver because its rays are scattered
over divers objects. It is compared to a monkey because it leaps from
object to object. It is compared to the inconstant air because it is
unstable (chanchala). It is compared to an elephant in rut because of
its passionate impetuosity. ... This tendency to oscillation is innate
in the mental substance.
