The true metaphysical and contemplative man, who running and shooting up above
his own logical or self-rational life, pierceth into the highest life; such a
one, who by universal love and holy affection abstracting himself from himself,
endeavours the nearest union with the divine essence that may be, Kevrpov
Kevrpœ owátpas, as Plotinus speaks; knitting his own centre ... unto the
centre of divine being This life is nothing else but God’s own breath within
him, and an infant-Christ (if I may use the expression) formed in his soul, who
is in a sense Imavyaopa ifjs ô6$r\s, ‘the shining forth of the Father’s glory.’
But yet we must not mistake; this knowledge is but here in its infancy; there
is a higher knowledge, or a higher degree of this knowledge.
