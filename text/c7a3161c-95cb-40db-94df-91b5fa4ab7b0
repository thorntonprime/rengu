Title: Of Course Things Like That Can Happen
Description: December 8
---
God once made love to a saint who had a hairy belly. Of course things
like that can happen!

And it was a surprise, only to the novice on the path, when the
saint’s stomach began to swell just like a woman’s.

Weeks went by, then months. The saint’s cheeks blossomed into
beautiful roses. He became like a young bride, pregnant with a holy
child. His gratitude was speechless, and his eyes shone like two
planets making love.

The town began to stand outside his house at night, for it had come to
the attention of the faithful that as the moon passed by on its round,
it would sometimes bend over and kiss his roof! Of course things like
that can happen.

Life went on, amidst the ten thousand other wonders： Whiskers and
weeds and trees and charming babies kept emerging.

People and cattle and bees worked side by side, all sweetly humming.

And come lunch, all dined on the same mysterious divine manna of
nourishing Love—disguised in a thousand shapes, colors and forms.

Galaxies gave away their ingenious ideas and told us of their private
body functions. So man too, eats, burps and excretes more worlds.

How is it that invisible thoughts can lift heavy matter and build
cities and armies and altars?

All contain a hidden strategy to be transformed again into the holy
wonderment!
