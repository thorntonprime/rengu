When I had emptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering, I was led to
consider the wretchedness of this world, and the fearful consequences of our
first parents’ disobedience.  Then I saw that there was no hope of repentance
for mankind, that they were getting worse day by day, and that for their
impenitence God’s everlasting punishment was hanging over them; and I made
haste to withdraw myself from the evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to
devote myself to the service of God.
