Intellect (νοῦς) the Father of all, He who is Life and Light, gave birth to
Man, a Being like to Himself. And He took delight in Man, as being His own
offspring. ...  With good reason then did God take delight in Man; for it
was God’s own form that God took delight in. And God delivered over to Man
all things that had been made.
