If divine truth spring up only from the root of true goodness; how shall we
ever endeavour to be good, before we know what it is to be so? or how shall
we convince the gainsaying world of truth, unless we could also inspire
virtue into it?

To both which we shall make this reply; that there are some radical
principles of knowledge that are so deeply sunk into the souls of men,
as that the impression cannot easily be obliterated, though it may be so
much darkened.
