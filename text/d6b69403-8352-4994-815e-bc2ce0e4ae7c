That contrariness which is now in us ... is cause of our tribulations and all
our woe. and our Lord Jesus taketh them and sendeth them up to Heaven, and
there are they made more sweet and delectable than heart may think or tongue
may tell. And when we come thither we shall find them ready, all turned into
very fair and endless worships.
