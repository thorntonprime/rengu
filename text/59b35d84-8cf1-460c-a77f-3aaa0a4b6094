The soul cannot perform living works, unless it receives from the sun,
i.e., from Christ, the assistance of the light of grace; unless it
secures the protection of the moon, i.e., of the Virgin Mary, the
Mother of Christ; and unless it imitates the examples of the other
saints.  And from the coming together of these a living and perfect
work is gathered together in it.  Whence the order of living hangs on
those three.
