A man does not attain to freedom from action by non-performance of
action, nor does he attain to perfection merely by giving up action.

No one can ever rest even for an instant without performing action,
for all are impelled by the Gunas, born of Prakriti, to act
incessantly. ...

That man, who is devoted to the Self, is satisfied with Self and is
Content in the Self alone, for him there is nothing to do.

For him there is nothing in this world to gain by action or to lose by
inaction： nor does he need to depend on any being for any object. ...

O Pârtha, there is nothing for Me to accomplish： nothing there is in
the three worlds unattained or to be attained by Me. and yet I
continue in action. ...

One should not unsettle the understanding of the ignorant who are
attached to action; the man of wisdom, by steadily performing actions,
should engage (the ignorant) in all right action.
