Title: Keeping Things Whole
By: Mark Strand
Format: verse
---
In a field
I am the absence
of field.
This is
always the case.
Wherever I am
I am what is missing.

When I walk
I part the air
and always
the air moves in
to fill the spaces
where my bodyâ€™s been.

We all have reasons
for moving.
I move
to keep things whole.
