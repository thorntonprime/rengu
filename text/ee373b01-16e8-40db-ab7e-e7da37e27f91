Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favoured harlot,
the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her
whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will
discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy
nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and
will set thee as a gazingstock.
