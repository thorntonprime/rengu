Now, if asked. ‘What is this spirit of meditation?’ I reply that it is to have
a sincerely benevolent and sympathetic heart at all times, whether one is
talking or wagging one’s elbow when writing, whether one is moving, or resting,
whether one’s luck is good or bad, whether one is in honour or in shame, or in
gain or in loss, in right or in wrong, bundling all these things up into one
verse heading and concentrating your energy with the force of an iron rock
under the navel and lower part of the abdomen. ...

If you have this “spirit’ ... your two-edged swords will be your desk or
meditation table, placed always before you. The saddle you ride on will be the
cushion on which you sit in meditation. The hills, the streams, the plains will
be the floor of your meditation hall. The four corners of the earth and its ten
directions, the height and the depth of the universe will be to you the great
‘cave’ in which you are performing your meditation -- they will be, in very
truth, the substance of your real self.
