Let not any question the close and Divine Contexture of the whole Work
in all the parts and conduct of it; by a firm connexion of Causes and
Effects, like links in a Chain, from its first beginning of its last
end\ because he meeteth with an Hell, as well as an Heaven in this
work of God. Divine Love (which transcendently excels in all Wisdom
and Prudence, beyond all the highest wits of men, the richest
Contrivances of Poets,) knoweth how to joynt an Hell into its work,
with such Divine Artifice, incomprehensible to Men or Angels, that
this also shall be beautiful, with delights in its place and shall
give a sweetness a lustre to the whole piece.
