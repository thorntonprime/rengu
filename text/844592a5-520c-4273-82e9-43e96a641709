A man forgets God if he is entangled in the world of mâyâ, through a woman.
It is the Mother of the Universe who has assumed the form of mâyâ, the form
of woman.  One who knows this rightly does not feel like leading the life of
mâyâ in the world.  But he who truly realizes that all women are
manifestations of the Divine Mother may lead a spiritual life in the world.
Without realizing God one cannot truly know what a woman is. ...  While
practising sâdhanâ a man should regard a woman as a raging forest fire or a
black cobra.  But in the state of perfection, after the realization of God,
she appears as the Blissful Mother. Then you will look on her as a form of
the Divine Mother.
