Commentary: In speaking to an Indian king
---
\‘Well, then,’ said the king, ‘you must make me too, O Apollonius, a
member of your religious brotherhood.’ ‘I would do so,’ said the
other, ‘provided only you will not be esteemed vulgar and held cheap
by your subjects. For in the case of a king a philosophy that is at
once moderate and indulgent makes a good temper, as is seen in your
own case; but an excess of rigour and severity would seem vulgar, O
king, and beneath your august station; and what is more, it might be
construed by the envious as due to pride.’
