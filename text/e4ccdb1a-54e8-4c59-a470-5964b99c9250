Title: Calculated Malice
Description: April 12
---
There is a bird of paradise, Huma, that comes close to earth but never
touches the ground.

Sometimes it so nears one has a chance to leap up and touch it.

Those who have received its blessing, from knowing its body firsthand,

all have something in commonï¼š Their minds never know any calculated
malice, and thus are not weighted down.
