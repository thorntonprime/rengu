The Egyptians who receive instruction begin by learning the first
method of writing, called epistolographic; ... then they learn the
second, which is hieratic, used by the sacred writers or
hierogrammates; finally comes the highest and last method which they
learn, the hieroglyphic method, of which one part has a literal
significance, by means of the first elements (syllabic or alphabetic
of the words they represent), and the other a symbolic significance.
