  These words form part of an alchemical document which can be traced
  through the Middle Ages to Arabic sources such as Jabir, who claimed
  he was quoting from Apollonius of Tyana; also found in the
  Greco-Egyptian Leyden Papyrus (c. 300 A.D.) at Thebes. Cf. Holmyard：
  Alchemy, and Seligmann： The Mirror of Magic.
