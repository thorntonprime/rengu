It is certain that, at the moment of His death, He (Christ) was
forsaken and, as it were, annihilated in His soul, and was deprived of
any relief and consolation, since His Father left Him in the most
intense aridity, according to the lower part of His nature. Wherefore
He had perforce to cry out, sayingï¼š My God! My God! Why hast Thou
forsaken Me? This was the greatest desolation, with respect to sense,
that He had suffered in His life. And thus He wrought herein the
greatest work that He had ever wrought, whether in miracles or in
mighty works, during the whole of His life, either upon earth or in
Heaven, which was the reconciliation and union of mankind, through
grace, with God.
