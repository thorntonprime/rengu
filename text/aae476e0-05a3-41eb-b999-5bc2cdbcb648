Title: Just before Dawn
---
The best time to look for treasure starts
late at night.

The sediment then settles in our sphere,
freed from all the day's hard wants.

One can get a clearer shot at God moving
in the sky forest, just before dawn.

And is there ever a minute, my dear,
when you are not hunting Love?
