Title: How to Bloom
Description: April 8
Format: Verse
---
The almond trees in bloom： all we can accomplish here is to ever know
ourselves in our earthly appearance.

I endlessly marvel at you, blissful ones -- at your demeanor, the way
you bear your vanishing adornment with timeless purpose. Ah, to
understand how to bloom： then would the heart be carried beyond all
milder dangers, to be consoled in the great one.
