Title: I See the Face
Page: 299
---
I see the face that was my home.
My loving says, I will let go of everything for that.

My soul begins to keep rhythm,
as if music were playing.

My reason says, What do you call this cypress-energy
that straightens what was bent double?

All things change in this presence.
People no longer know friend from foe.

Soul keeps unfolding inward.
The body leaves the body.

A wealth you cannot imagine flows through you.

Do not consider what strangers say.
Be secluded in your secret heart-house,
that bowl of silence.

Talking, no matter how humble-seeming,
is really a kind of bragging.
Let silence be the art we practice.
