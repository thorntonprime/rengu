Those we call blessed, who can purge the Queen of the Sages of her
impurity, who can circulate the Catholic Virgin Earth by means of our
crystalline Physico-magical Art, and who have beheld the King, with
his crown on his head, and his strength of inward fire, come forth
from the chamber of his crystal grave, his bodily semblance glorified
with all the most beautiful hues that the world affords, like a
shining carbuncle, or like a transparent, compact, and diaphanous
crystal -- like a salamander that has spued forth all water, and
washes away the leprosy of base metals with fire.
