Title: Selling Your Art
Description: February 24
---
At the very least you are a vital cell in a cosmic holy body.

And everyone works so hard, no matter what they do.

There is no place for you to go but onward into a greater freedom.

The poor man rarely parties because of so many cares. We should put an
end to that.

Knowledge can be pawned for a good sum. Find some truth and mix it
with your talents.

If you can get the balance right between you and others, and you and
death, shops will start selling your art.

And maybe even a masterpiece you will become, your every gesture.
