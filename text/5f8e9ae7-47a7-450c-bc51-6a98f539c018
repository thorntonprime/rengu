A work done from within thy soul is necessary, for no door will be
opened to thee by things given on loan.

A water-spring inside the house is better than an aqueduct that comes
from outside.

How goodly is the Conduit which is the source of all things! It makes
you independent of these other conduits.

You are quaffing drink from a hundred fountains： whenever any of
those hundred yields less, your pleasure is diminished：

But when the sublime Fountain gushes from within you. no longer need
you steal from the other fountains.
