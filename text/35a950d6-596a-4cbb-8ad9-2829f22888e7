Once a division of the Japanese army was engaged in a sham
battle, and some of the officers found it necessary to make
their headquarters in Gasan's temple.

Gasan told his cook： "Let the officers have only the same simple
fare we eat."

This made the army men angry, as they were used to very
deferential treatment. One came to Gasan and said： "Who do you
think we are? We are soldiers, sacrificing our lives for our
country. Why don't you treat us accordingly?"

Gasan answered sternly： "Who do you think we are? We are
soldiers of humanity, aiming to save all sentient beings."
