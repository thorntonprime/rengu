Holy is God the Father of all. who is before the first beginning：
holy is God. whose purpose is accomplished by his several Powers：
holy is God. who wills to be known, and is known by them that are his own.
  Holy art Thou, who by thy word hast constructed all that is：
holy art Thou, whose brightness nature has not darkened：
holy art Thou, of whom all nature is an image.
  Holy art Thou, who art stronger than all domination：
holy art Thou, who art greater than all pre-eminence：
holy art Thou, who surpassest all praises.
  Accept pure offerings of speech from a soul and heart uplifted to thee.
Thou of whom no words can tell, no tongue can speak, whom silence only can
declare.
