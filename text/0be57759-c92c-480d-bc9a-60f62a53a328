When we were children we were innocent. But there was in us a seed of ignorance
which grew as we grew and. over-powering us. cast away our innocent nature and
led us astray.  We were thereafter caught in the toils of desire and action and
we move in a vicious circle of transitory pleasures and pains. It is necessary
that we should hand ourselves over to the Divine and through His grace burn up
this seed which is the cause of our misery and bondage, and regain our lost
childhood. When once we get it back, it cannot be taken away from us. The burnt
seed does not germinate. We will remain pure children for all our life.
