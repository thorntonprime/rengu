He that hath got the mastery over his own will, feels no violence from
without, finds no contests within; and like a strong man, keeping his
house, he preserves all his goods in safety; and when God calls for
him out of this state of mortality, he finds in himself a power to lay
down his own life; neither is it so much taken from him, as quietly
and freely surrendered up by him.
