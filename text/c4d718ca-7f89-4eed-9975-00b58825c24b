No one should be depressed and give the false impression that the
precepts of the Gospel are impossible or impracticable. God who has
predestined the salvation of man has, of course, not laid commandments
upon him with the intention of making him an offender because of their
impracticability. No; but so that by their holiness and the necessity
of them for a virtuous life they may be a blessing to us, as in this
life so in eternity.
