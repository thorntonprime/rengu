If this birth really happens no creature can hinder thee, all point
thee to God and this birth. We find in lightning an analogy for this.
Whatever it strikes, whether tree, beast or man. it turns towards
itself with the shock. A man with his back to it instantly flings
round to face it; all the thousand leaves of the tree turn over to
front the stroke. So with all whom this birth befalls, they are
promptly turned towards this birth with everything present, be it
never so earthly. Nay, even what was formerly a hindrance is now
nothing but a help. Thy face is turned so full towards this birth, no
matter what thou dost see and hear, thou receivest nothing save this
birth in anything. All things are simply God to thee who seest only
God in all things. Like one who looks long at the sun, he encounters
the sun in whatever he afterwards looks at. If this is lacking, this
looking for and seeing God in all and sundry, then thou lackest this
birth.
