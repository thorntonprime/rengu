The mouth of the pit was open, and I saw a huge animal like a dragon,
which let down its tail. I knew that God had sent it and that I should
be saved in this way. I took hold of its tail and it dragged me out. A
heavenly voice cried to me, ‘This is an excellent escape of thine, O
Abû Hamza! We have saved thee from death by means of a death.’
