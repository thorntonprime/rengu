Title: As Fertile As I Am (I)
Description: March 24
---
Just the deep quiet, just wanting that now, the unmoving breeze (God)
to penetrate me

as if I were a woman needing, wanting, destined to conceive,

and now was my only moment ever available to this life when I would be
as fertile as I am.

If the Beloved does not lie beside me in the next hour, if Light does
not leave its seed

all over my frame and inside, so full inside that I drip upon the
street

as I then bless the earth with my steps. Another eon may pass for a
conjuncture of the elements in existence

to be as opportune, as perfect, as all seems now. But I can’t wait,
not any longer, knowing how immaculate ... the moment.

So I am begging with all my strength, every cell has joined in and is
calling ... now, now, now, now; don’t resist us God.
