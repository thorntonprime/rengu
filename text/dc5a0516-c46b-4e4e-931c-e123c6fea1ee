Manasika Pooja (mental worship) iยง more powerful than external Pooja
with flowers, etc. Arjuna thought that Bhima was not doing any kind of
worship. He was proud of his external worship of Lord Siva. He offered
plenty of Bael leaves. But Bhima offered to the Lord mentally the Bael
leaves of all the Bael trees of the whole world. He was doing Manasika
Pooja of Lord Siva. ...

Manasika Pooja can be done by advanced students. Beginners should
certainly do worship with flowers, sandal paste, incense, etc.
