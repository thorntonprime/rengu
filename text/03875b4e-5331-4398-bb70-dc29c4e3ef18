To overcome sorrow and win happiness men wander in vain, for they have not
sanctified their thought, the mysterious essence of holiness. Then I must keep
my thought well governed and well guarded; what need is there of any vows save
the vow to guard the thought? ...

The thief Heedlessness, waiting to escape the eye of remembrance, robs men of
the righteousness they have gathered, and they come to an evil lot. The
Passions, a band of robbers, seek a lodging, and when they have found it they
rob us and destroy our good estate of life. Then let remembrance never
withdraw from the portal of the spirit; and if it depart, let it be brought
back by remembering the anguish of hell.  Remembrance grows easily in happy
obedient souls from the reverence raised by their teachers’ lore and from
dwelling with their masters. ... The thought thus must be kept ever under
watch; I must always be as if without carnal sense, like a thing of wood.
