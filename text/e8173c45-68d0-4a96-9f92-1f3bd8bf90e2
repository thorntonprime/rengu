Title: Each Soul Completes Me
Description: November 30
---
My Beloved said, “My name is not complete without yours.”

And I thought： How could a human’s worth ever be such?

And God, knowing all our thoughts, and all our thoughts are just
innocent steps on the

path, then addressed my heart,

God revealed a sublime truth to the world when He sang,

“I am made whole by your life. Each soul, each soul completes Me.”
