Despite the identity o f the master with the Self, the scriptures
categorically declare that however learned or endowed with superhuman
powers, one cannot realise the Self without the master’s grace. What
is the secret of this?

Though in reality the master is the very Self of all, the soul having
by ignorance become differentiated and individualised, cannot find out
its original Pure state of Being, without the master’s grace. Hence
the scriptural statement.
