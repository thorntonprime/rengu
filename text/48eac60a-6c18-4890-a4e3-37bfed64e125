What is our work? Our only work here is to seek God, or do such work
that will enable us to realize God. ‘Worldly’ work is what makes you
forget God. A work in which you have no thought of God at all, how can
that work help you in any way to attain God? ...  Doing Karma in a
state of Yoga i.e. doing actions in union with God -- that is Karma
Yoga. ... Do not think that the world will not go on without your
work. God has engaged you in work only as His agent. If we are taken
away He will find somebody else for that work.
