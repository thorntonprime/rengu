---
Verily thou must sojourn and dwell in thy essence, in thy ground, and there
God shall mix thee with his simple essence without the medium of any image.
No image represents and signifies itself; it stands for that of which it
is the image. Now seeing that thou hast no image save of what is outside
thee, therefore it is impossible for thee to be beatified by any image
whatsoever. ... All things must be forsaken. God scorns to work among
images.
