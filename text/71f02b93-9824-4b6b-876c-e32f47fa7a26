As to that class of monstrous natures who not only believe that there
are no Gods, or that they are negligent, or to be propitiated, but in
contempt of mankind conjure the souls of the living and say that they
can conjure the dead and promise to charm the Gods with sacrifices and
prayers, and will utterly overthrow individuals and whole houses and
states for the sake of money -- let him who is guilty of any of these
things be condemned. ... And when he is dead let him be cast beyond
the borders unburied.
