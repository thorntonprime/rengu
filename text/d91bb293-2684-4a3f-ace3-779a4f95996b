Passion is of two kindsï¼š (1) desire of pleasure and lust, and (2)
desire of worldly honour and authority. He who follows pleasure and
lust haunts taverns, and mankind are safe from his mischief, but he
who desires honour and authority lives in cells and monasteries, and
not only has lost the right way himself but also leads others into
error.
