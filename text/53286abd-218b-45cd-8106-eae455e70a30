When the Moon of Canaan YúSUF
In the prison of Egypt darken’d.
Nightly from her spacious PalaceChamber.
and its rich array.
Stole ZULAIKHA like a fantom
To the dark and narrow dungeon
  Where her buried Treasure lay.
Then to those about her wond'ring—
‘Were my Palace.' she replied.
‘Wider than Horizon-wide.
‘It were narrower than an Ant’s eye.
‘Were my Treasure not inside：
‘And an Ant’s eye. if but there
‘My Lover. Heaven's horizon were.'
