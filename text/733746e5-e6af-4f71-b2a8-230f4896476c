There was a t√≠me when ... we beheld the beatific vision and were initiated
into a mystery which may be truly called most blessed, celebrated by us in
our state of innocence, before we had any experience of evils to come, when
we were admitted to the sight of apparitions innocent and simple and calm
and happy, which we beheld shining in pure light, pure ourselves and not yet
enshrined in that living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned
in the body, like an oyster in his shell.
