Title: What the Prom Queen Gets
Author: Hafiz
---
Time an enemy not easy to slay. It can tear
the wing apart, sever it with such an unclean
cut one can bleed for days.

An hour is a clever hallucination, a year more
so, a lifetime ... the grand hoax.

The way sound and light travel, the way all
come from a source that has never moved,

at the height of the action of longing or in the
perfect resistance to all the forces of morals ...
everything can stop.

That is where you want to be, where the clock's
tyranny has lost its influence.

One always gets a big prize for that -- for any
intelligent, overall functional, useful deductions.

The door prize is, heaven wraps itself in a box
and places itself at your feet.

With such a door prize, try to imagine what the
prom queen gets.
