If any man acts in such a way that his deeds are able to demean him,
be sure he is not acting according to the law of God’s kingdom. When
works are wrought according to humanity weeds and discord soon fall
among them, but he whose work is wrought in the kingdom of heaven
remains tranquil in every undertaking. ... Verily I say unto you：
works wrought out of the kingdom of God are dead works but works
wrought in the kingdom of God are living works. The prophet says：
‘God as little loves his works as he is disturbed and changed by
them.’ And so with the soul when she works in accordance with the law
of God’s kingdom. People of this sort are always the same whether they
work or whether they work not, for works give nothing to them and take
nothing from them.
