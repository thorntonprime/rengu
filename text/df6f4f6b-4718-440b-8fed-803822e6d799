As this Light vainly thinketh to understand God. it imagineth itself
to be God. and giveth itself out to be God, and wisheth to be
accounted so. and thinketh itself to be above all things, and well
worthy of all things, and that it hath a right to all things, and hath
got beyond all things, such as commandments, laws, and virtue, and
even beyond Christ and a Christian life, and setteth all these at
nought, for it doth not set up to be Christ, but the Eternal God. And
this is because Christ’s life is distasteful and burdensome to nature,
therefore she will have nothing to do with it; but to be God in
eternity and not man. or to be Christ as He was after His
resurrection, is all easy, and pleasant, and comfortable to nature,
and so she holdeth it to be best.
