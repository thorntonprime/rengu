If God should come and speak to us with His own voice (although He
ceaseth not to speak through His Scriptures), and should say to man,
thou wishest to sin, sin; do whatsoever pleaseth thee; whatever thou
lovest on earth, let it be thine; ... let no man resist thee; ... let
all these earthly things which thou hast desired abound unto thee, and
live in them, not for a season, but for ever; but My face thou shalt
never see. My brethren, wherefore did you groan, save because a chaste
fear enduring for ever and ever hath been born in you? Why is your
heart stricken? If God should say, Thou shalt never see My face, what
of it? Thou wilt abound in all that earthly felicity; temporal goods
will surround thee; thou wilt not lose them, nor forsake them; what
more dost thou want?  Chaste fear would weep indeed and groan, and
would say, Nay, let all be taken away, and let me see Thy face.
Chaste fear would cry out in the words of the psalm, ‘O God of hosts,
convert us, and shew Thy face： and we shall be saved’ (Ps. lxxix. 8 -
Douay). Chaste fear would cry out in the words of the psalm ... ‘One
thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after.’ What is this?
‘That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.’
What if he desire this for the sake of earthly felicity? Hear what
followeth： ‘that I may see the delight of the Lord,’ and as His
temple be protected (Ps. xxvi. 4 sq.). ... If you ask this one
thing ...  and fear to lose this one thing only, you will not envy
earthly delights, and you will look for that true happiness, and you
will be in His body to Whom it is sung： ‘Blessed are all they that
fear the Lord： that walk in His ways’ (Ps. cxxvii. 1).
