Ananda, if in this world disciples practiced meditation assiduously, though
they attained all the nine stages of calmness in Dhyana, yet do not accomplish
the attainment of Arhats free from the intoxicants arising from worldly
contaminations and attachments, it is wholly due to their grasping this
deceiving conception of discriminative thinking that is based on unrealities
and mistaking the delusion as being a reality.
