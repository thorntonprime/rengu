And you wait. You wait for the one thing
that will change your life,
make it more than it is --
something wonderful, exceptional,
stones awakening, depths opening to you.

In the dusky bookstalls
old books glimmer gold and brown.
You think of lands you journeyed through,
of paintings and a dress once worn
by a woman you never found again.

And suddenly you knowï¼š that was enough.
You rise and there appears before you
in all its longings and hesitations
the shape of what you lived.
