Are you not ashamed of being more cowardly and mean-spirited than
runaway slaves?  How do they leave their masters when they run away?
What lands or servants have they to trust to? Do not they steal just a
morsel to last them for the first days, and then go on their way over
land or it may be sea. contriving one resource after another to Iceep
themselves alive? And when did a runaway slave ever die of hunger? Yet
you are all of a flutter and keep awake at nights for fear you should
run short of necessaries. ... How often did you boast that you could
face death at any rate with a quiet mind!

‘Yes. but my family will starve.’

What of that? Does their hunger lead in a different direction? Is not
the way that leads below the same, and the world it leads to the
same?  ... Even the richest and those who have held the highest
offices must descend, nay even kings and emperors Only you will
descend hungry, if it so chance, and they will burst with over eating
and overdrinking. ...

Can you not draw water, or write, or take charge of children, or be
another man’s doorkeeper?

But it is disgraceful, you say, to be reduced to this necessity.

First learn then what is disgraceful, and then tell us that you are a
philosopher; but for the present, if another call you so, do not allow
him.
