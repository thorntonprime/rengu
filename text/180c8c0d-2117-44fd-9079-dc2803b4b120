This (Knowledge) should be imparted only to him whose mind has been
pacified, who has controlled his senses and is freed from all defects,
who has practised the duties (enjoined by the scriptures) and is
possessed of good qualities, who is always obedient (to the teacher)
and aspires after liberation only.
