List ye. good people allï¼š there is none happier than he who stands in
uttermost detachment. No temporal, carnal pleasure but brings some ghostly
mischief in its train, for the flesh lusts after things that run counter to
the spirit and spirit lusts for things that are repugnant to the flesh. He
who sows the tares of love in flesh reaps death but he who sows good love
seed in the spirit reaps of the spirit eternal life. The more man flees from
creatures the faster hastens to him their creator.
