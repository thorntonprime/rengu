  - Sacrifice-Death=Death=The Happy Death
By: Peter Sterry
Commentary: the essence (purusha) is reunited with the primordial
  substance (prakriti) in the 'glorified body'.

This is the precious, the blessed work of Death in a Believer. It
breaketh the union, it maketh a separation not betweerrChrist. and a
Believer, not between the Soul, and Body of a Believer, as they are
joyned together in Christ by the band, and unity of the Eternal
Spirit, and make one Spiritual Man, or Person in Christ; but between
the precious, and the vile, between the Carnal and Spiritual Principle
of a Saint both in Soul and Body.
