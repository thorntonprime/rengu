Know that our Mercury is before the eyes of all men, though it is
known to few. When it is prepared, its splendour is most admirable;
but the sight is vouchsafed to none, save the sons of knowledge. Do
not despise it. therefore, when you see it in sordid guise; for if you
do. you will never accomplish our Magistery -- and if you can change
its countenance, the transformation will be glorious. For our water is
a most pure virgin, and is loved of many, but meets all her wooers in
foul garments, in order that she may be able to distinguish the worthy
from the unworthy.
