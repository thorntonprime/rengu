Seek not for life on earth or in heaven. Thirst for life is delusion.
Knowing life to be transitory, wake up from this dream of ignorance
and strive to attain knowledge and freedom before death shall claim
thee. The purpose of this mortal life is to reach the shore of
immortality by conquering both life and death.
