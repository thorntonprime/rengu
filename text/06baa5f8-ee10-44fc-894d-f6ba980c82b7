To be capable of knowing God, and to wish and hope to know him, is the
road which leads straight to the Good; and it is an easy road to
travel.  Everywhere God will come to meet you, everywhere he will
appear to you, at places and times at which you look not for it, in
your waking hours and in your sleep, when you are journeying by water
and by land, in the night-time and in the day-time, when you are
speaking and when you are silent; for there is nothing which is not
God.
