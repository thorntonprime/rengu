In the same way that the mind seeks variety in foods and other things,
so does it want diversity in sâdhanâ. It rebels against monotonous
practices To cease sâdhanâ is a grave error. The practice must never
be renounced under any circumstances. Bad thoughts will always be
pressing to penetrate into the mental laboratory： if the aspirant
suspends his sâdhanâ his mind becomes the workshop of Satan.
