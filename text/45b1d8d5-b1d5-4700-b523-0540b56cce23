The mind of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is
always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to
those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. And
he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect
mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he forgets earthly interests
and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do not
see that he is inspired.
