Religion is no sullen Stoicism, no sour Pharisaism; it does not
consist in a few melancholy passions, in some dejected looks or
depressions of mindï¼š but it consists in freedom, love, peace, life,
and power; the more it comes to be digested into our lives, the more
sweet and lovely we shall find it to be. Those spots and wrinkles
which corrupt minds think they see in the face of religion, are indeed
nowhere else but in their own deformed and misshapen apprehensions. It
is no wonder when a defiled fancy comes to be the glass, if you have
an unlovely reflection.
