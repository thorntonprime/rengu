Like the baseless fabric of this vision.
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces.
The solemn temples, the great globe itself.
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded.
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.
