Would you see the deepest root and iron strength of pride and self-adoration,
you must enter into the dark chamber of man’s fiery soul, where the light of
God (which alone gives humility and meek submission to all created spirits)
being extinguished by the death which Adam died, Satan, or which is the same
thing, self-exaltation, became the strong man that kept possession of the
house till a stronger than he should come upon him.  ...  The fancied riches
of parts, the glitter of genius, the flights of imagination, the glory of
learning, and the self-conceited strength of natural reason： these are the
strongholds of fallen nature, the master-builders of pride’s temple in the
heart of man, and which, as so many priests, keep up the daily worship of
idol-self.
