If you think there is uncertainty as to the efficacy of calling upon
the sacred name once, then it means that there is doubt about it every
time you call upon the sacred name. The Buddha’s Vow was to give birth
into the Pure Land to those who would call upon his name even once,
and so there is efficacy in every repetition of the sacred name.
