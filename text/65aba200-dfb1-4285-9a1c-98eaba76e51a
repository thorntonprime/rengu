Vocation to Solitude --
To deliver oneself up,
to hand oneself over,
entrust oneself completely to the silence
of a wide landscape of woods and hills,
or sea, or desert;
to sit still while the sun comes up over land
and fills its silences with light.
To pray and work in the morning
and to labor in meditation in the evening
when night falls upon that land
and when the silence fills itself with darkness and with stars.
This is a true and special vocation.
There are few who are willing to belong
completely to such silence,
to let it soak into their bones,
to breathe nothing but silence,
to feed on silence,
and to turn the very substance of their life
into a living and vigilant silence.
