If you wish not your head to be lost, be (lowly as) a foot： be under
the protection of the Qutb (spiritual Pole) who is possessed of
discernment.

Though you be a king, deem not yourself above him： though you be
honey, gather naught but his sugar-cane. ...

As you have no strength, keep making a lamentation; since you are
blind, take care, do not turn your head away from him that sees the
road.
