Will-power should be understood to be the strength of mind which makes
it capable of meeting success or failure with equanimity. ... Success
develops arrogance and the man's spiritual progress is thus arrested.
Failure on the other hand is beneficial, in as much as it opens the
eyes of the man to his limitations and prepares him to surrender
himself.  Self-surrender is synonymous with eternal happiness.
Therefore one should try to gain the equipoise of mind under all
circumstances. That is will-power.
