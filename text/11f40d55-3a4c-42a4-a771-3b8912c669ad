Created beings, although they are destroyed (in their original forms)
at the periods of dissolution, yet, being affected by the good or evil
acts of former existence, are never exempted from their consequences;
and when Brahmâ creates the world anew, they are the progeny of his
will, in the fourfold condition of gods, men, animals, and inanimate
things.
