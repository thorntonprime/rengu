I was thinking about the river's flow and how it doesn't know why, but
it never stops

And the ocean's tides they rise and they drop, but they never stop

And this world is spinning without end or beginning and it never
stops, I hope she never stops

So I love you for nothing, one of natures hidden something and I'll
never stop

Because everything stops when I'm with you
The world I know stops when I'm with you

Two birds fall from the orange tree as will you and me
And the salt water shines in a swirling sea as will you and me
And these clouds climb in the cobalt skies as will you and me
Water cycles but it NEVER WILL DIE, nor will you and me

Because everything stops when I'm with you
The world I know stops when I'm with you

We flow just like water, we start slow, but never move backwards
This river becomes an ocean, evaporate into heaven

Because everything stops when I'm with you
The world I know stops when I'm with you
