Throughout eternity, that which we call Mind
has never been born and has never died.
Changeless, it has no past or future.
It is not subject to cause and effect.
It is not good or evil, true or false, male or female.
Mind is no one's property and it does not seek liberation.
It is formless and hard to percieve since it is not subject to the senses.
Many are those who seek It,
yet they do not realize that it already lies
within themselves.
It is what gives them life.
