We may rest assured that nothing whatever happens on earth without Godâ€™s
permission.  What a source of consolation to know that even the sufferings
and adversities which God sends us are for our very best, and have in view
our eternal salvation. Ah, how great will be our shame when we stand before
the judgment-seat of God and see clearly the loving intention of Divine
Providence in sending us those trials which we tried to evade, thus battling
against our own salvation!
