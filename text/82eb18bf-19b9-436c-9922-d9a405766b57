We rather glorify God by entertaining the impressions of his glory
upon us, than by communicating any kind of glory to him. Then does a
good man become the tabernacle of God wherein the divine Shechinah
does rest, and which the divine glory fills, when the  frame
of his mind and life is wholly according to that idea and pattern
which he receives from the mount. We best glorify him when we
grow most like to him.
