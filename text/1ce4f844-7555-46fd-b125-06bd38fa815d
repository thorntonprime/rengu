I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyok’d humour of your idleness：
Yet herein will I imitate the sun.
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world.
That when he please again to be himself.
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at.
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
