It is good that you are about to enter a profession [the military]
that will make you self-sufficient and set you on your own feet. Wait
patiently to see if your inner life narrows in the grip of this
profession. I consider it to be a very difficult and challenging one,
for it is greatly burdened with conventions and allows little room for
personal interpretations of its duties. But in the midst of these very
unfamiliar conditions your inner solitude will be a support and a home
to you. It will be the starting point of all your journeys.
