Commentary: This passage shows a profound spiritual affinity with the
  outlook of the American Indian, without it being any question of a
  ‘borrowing’ -- especially where the outward forms of the two societies
  in question are so evidently dissimilar.

Over-refinement of vision leads to debauchery in colour;
over-refinement of hearing leads to debauchery in sound;
over-refinement of charity leads to confusion in virtue;
over-refinement of duty towards one’s neighbour leads to perversion of
principle; overrefinement of music leads to lewdness of thought;
over-refinement of wisdom leads to an extension of mechanical art; and
over-refinement of shrewdness leads to an extension of vice. ...

Therefore, for the perfect man who is unavoidably summoned to power
over his fellows, there is naught like inaction. By means of inaction
he will be able to adapt himself to the natural conditions of
existence. And so it is that he who respects the state as his own body
is fit to support it, and he who loves the state as his own body is
fit to govern it. And if I can refrain from injuring my internal
economy, and from taxing my powers of sight and hearing, sitting like
a corpse while my dragon-power is manifested around, in profound
silence while my thunder-voice resounds, the powers of heaven
responding to every phase of my will, as under the yielding influence
of inaction all things are brought to maturity and thrive, -- what
leisure then have I to set about governing the world?
