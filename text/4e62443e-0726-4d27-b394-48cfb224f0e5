Title: Less Inclined to Drink
Description: January 10
---
She kissed the best, a dog I knew, and there were infinitely fewer
complications;

thus, at the end of the day I felt less inclined to drink.

Knowing it is to our advantage to never belittle anything

I feel I should say something positive about human lipsï¼š

I had some fine moments with them, we tried, we tangoed from different
angles,

but I like my affections and investments of time to be appreciated
enough on an ongoing basis

to see a pretty tail always wag.
