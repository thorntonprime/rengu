Common-sense is the fundamental factor in all Sadhanas (spiritual
disciplines). No rule is an eternal rule. Rules change from place to place,
time to time and from one condition to another condition. ... The objective
of all Anushthanas (religious austerities) is rigorous mental discipline and
not mere physical mortification. ... Abnormal cravings are against
Anushthana, not the normal requirements.
