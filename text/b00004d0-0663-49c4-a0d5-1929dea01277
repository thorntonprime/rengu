It should be noted that common gold is useless for this purpose, being
unsuitable and dead. ... You must, therefore, seek to obtain gold
which has a pure, living spirit, and of which the sulphur is not yet
weakened and sophisticated, but is pure and clear (by passing through
antimony, or by the heaven and sphere of Saturn, and being purged of
all its defilement); otherwise the first substance, being spiritual
and ethereal, will not combine with it. For this Magistery deals only
with pure bodies, and suffers no unclean thing near, on, or around it.
