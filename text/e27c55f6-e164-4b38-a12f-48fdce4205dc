Title: Several Times in the Last Week
---
Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the
streets trying to find you.

And several times in the last week, God Himself has even come to my
door -- asking me for your address!

Once I said, “God, I thought You knew everything. Why are you asking
me where Your lovers live?”

And the Beloved replied, Indeed, Hafiz, I do know everything—but it is
fun playing dumb once in awhile.

And I love intimate chat and the warmth of your heart’s fire.

Maybe we should make this poem into a song -- I think it has potential!

How does this refrain sound, for I know it is a truth：

Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the
streets trying to find you.

And several times in the last week, God Himself has come to my door --

so sweetly asking for your address, wanting the beautiful warmth of
your heart’s fire.
