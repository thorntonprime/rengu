---
O silence, my love silence,
I have feared youï¼š my tongue
has rattled on my teeth
dreading to be dumb so long
when I am done with breath.
  And I have needed prattle,
kind blather, and the come and go
of voices, human voices,
the sky whose moon you are,
the ground whose flower.
  But I beseech you come,
now, my love silence, O
reward and freedom, balance
beyond choices, in whom alone is heard
the meditation of the twilight bird
and the never to be spoken word.
