Actions, (both enjoined and prohibited), bring about one’s connection
with the body; when the connection with the body has taken place
pleasure and pain most surely follow; thence come attraction and
repulsion, from them actions follow again, as the results of which
merit and demerit appertain to an ignorant man, which again are
similarly followed by the connection with the body. This
transmigratory existence is thus going on continually for ever like a
wheel.
