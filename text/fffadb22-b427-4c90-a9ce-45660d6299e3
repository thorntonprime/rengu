It is in our power to choose the better, and likewise to choose the
worse The soul.  when it cleaves to evil things, draws near to
corporeal nature, and for this reason the man who has chosen the worse
is under the dominion of Destiny.

\... The intelligent substance in us is self-determining. The
intelligent substance remains ever in the same state without change,
not partaking of the nature of the things which come into being, and
therefore Destiny has no hold on it.
