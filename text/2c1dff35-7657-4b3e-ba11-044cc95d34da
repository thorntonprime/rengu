Whence comes it then, that we have so many complaints, each saying
that his occupation is a hindrance to him, while notwithstanding his
work is of God, who hindereth no man? Whence comes this inward reproof
and sense of guilt which torment and disquiet you? Dear children, know
that it is not your work which gives you this disquiet. No; it is your
want of order in fulfilling your work. If you performed your work in
the right method, with a sole aim to God, and not to yourselves, your
own likes and dislikes, and neither feared nor loved aught but God,
nor sought your own gain or pleasure, but only God's glory, in your
work, it would be impossible that it should grieve your conscience.
