The foundation of spiritual blessing is thisï¼š
that the soul look at God
without anything between;
here it receives its being and life
and draws its essence from the core of God,
unconscious of the knowing-process,
or love,
or anything else.

Then it is quite still in the essence of God,
not knowing at all where it is,
knowing nothing but God.
