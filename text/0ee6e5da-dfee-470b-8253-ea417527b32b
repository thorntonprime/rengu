Know that no man in this life ever gave up so much that he could not find
something else to let go. Few people, knowing what this means, can stand it
long, and yet it is an honest requital, a just exchange. To the extent that
you eliminate self from your activities.  God comes into them -- but not more
and no less. Begin with that, and let it cost you your uttermost. In this
way, and no other, is true peace to be found.
