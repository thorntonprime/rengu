Title: The Nighwatchman
Description: December 13 - December 14
---
I sit by the side of one who watches
like the stars at night without sleeping watch.

My friend sits on the roof at night.
I attend that watching.

During the day I help with the gardening.
He is both a tender of flowers
and flowering trees.

It is no shame to be in this friendship,
or if it is, it is.

I was on my way elsewhere
when I saw the nightwatchman
sitting on the sky's roof like a guard.

Like a king, like a gardener in his garden,
rainwet stones, like the body's hand-me-down.

The nightwatchman knows the way
from body to soul, how soul moves
in stomach bile, in blood and semen, in saliva.

Soul works inside those fluids
to keep the body fresh and full of energy.

So the stars and the planets and this world
are moving to bring grace here
through the cold night-clarity.

Events like battle arrows crisscross
from every direction. There is only one archer.

The skill of the sheepdog comes from the shepherd.
A city has a collective intelligence,
and each person there has a unique knowing.

Sometimes random bits pretend
to be a caravan, but it was a good messenger
who brought us the order out on the road
to Come back. Come back.
