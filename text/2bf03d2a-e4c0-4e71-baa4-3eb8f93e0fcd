The benefits that God contrives to give in any one way are to be found
and gotten in good ways one and all, and we ought to find in one way
the good things common to them, not those peculiar to that one. For
man must always do one thing, he cannot do them all.  He must always
be one thing and in that one find all. To try and do everything, this
as well as that, to give up his own method for another which for the
moment he likes better, believe me, is a fertile source of
instability.
