Zen students are with their masters at least ten years before
they presume to teach others. Nan-in was visited by Tenno, who,
having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher. The day
happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and carried an
umbrella. After greeting him Nan-in remarked： "I suppose you
left your wodden clogs in the vestibule. I want to know if your
umbrella is on the right or left side of the clogs."

Tenno, confused, had no instant answer. He realized that he was
unable to carry his Zen every minute. He became Nan-in's pupil,
and he studied six more years to accomplish his every-minute
Zen.
