The supreme Spirit, unlimited by time and space, of His own will and by the
power of His omnipotence, takes upon Himself the limited forms of time and
space. Know that the world, although appearing as substantial, has nothing
substantial in it： it is a void, being merely an appearance created by the
images and vagaries of the mind. Know the world to be an enchanted scene,
presented by the magic of maya.
