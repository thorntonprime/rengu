And they say： When we are bones and fragments, shall we, forsooth, be
raised up as a new creation?

Say： Be ye stones or iron

Or something yet more unyielding in your estimation! Then will they
say： Who shall restore us? Say： He Who created you the first time.
Then will they shake their heads at thee, and say： When shall that
be? Say： It will perhaps be soon.
