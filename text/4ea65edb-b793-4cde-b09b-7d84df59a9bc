Title: Just the Way I Would
---
The dreams we share of freedom.
The dreams we share of love.

There is such a unison in our every
movement, in our every desire;

we are so alike that I cannot tell the
difference anymore between us.

I could walk into any house and feel
at home,

because you have arranged everything
just the way I would.
