Title: The Color of Your Ocean Will Change
Description: February 20
---
It is possible that just a drop of dye from a vial the Friend holds
could change the color of an ocean.

I know I have talked about this in different poems, this basic
concept,

but will now say it from a slightly different angle in case that first
arrow I shot completely missed.

The presence of a Perfect One reaches a seed that is planted in you,

and from that divine warmth, God will lose His shyness, thaw as it
were, and no matter what now,

no matter what you do, the sacred will begin to grow inside. The color
of your ocean will change.

The drop of holy water, the needed dye, has touched your forehead,

the air did that to you at birth, as did the first hands that touched
you,

and the soft walls -- so many times -- of your Motherâ€™s womb you lay
against.
