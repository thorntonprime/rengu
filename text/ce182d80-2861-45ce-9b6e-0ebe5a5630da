This then is the sum of great knowledge for a man to know that by
himself he is nothing, and that whatever he is, he is from God and is
for God. ... It is however not enough that thou acknowledge that which
in thee is good to be from God, unless also on that account thou exalt
not thyself above him that hath not yet, who perchance will outstrip
thee when he shall have received.
