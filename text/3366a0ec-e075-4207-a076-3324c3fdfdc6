He that thus seeks shall find; he shall live in truth, and that shall
live in him; it shall be like a stream of living waters issuing out of
his own soul; he shall drink of the waters of his own cistern, and be
satisfied; he shall every morning find this heavenly manna lying upon
the top of his own soul, and be fed with it to eternal life; he will
find satisfaction within, feeling himself in conjunction with truth,
though all the world should dispute against him.
