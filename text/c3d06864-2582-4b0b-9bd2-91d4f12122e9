Title: My Teacher Once Told Me a Story
Description: March 27
---
My teacher once told me a story of a great saint, of a Perfect One,
who wanted to travel around his part of the world before he died and
talk about some spiritual matters to those who would come to listen.

And when his men and he reached a certain country he said to some of
his companions,

“Sensuality is in fine shape here, maybe even too fine shape, but my
basic concern is that we fit in well and that we get a few to listen
to my words which will plant seeds here for generations. So I want you
to employ twelve of the most beautiful erotic dancers who can travel
with us for the next month as we tour this land.”

So the dancers were employed, and from town to town and city to city
the great Master traveled. The dancers would begin the show as it
were, and once a nice crowd had gathered the saint would speak for
just a few minutes, then let the performers resume their art.

My own Master then stopped the story, looked at me in a very sweet and
somewhat amused way, then said,

“Hafiz, don’t forget the dancers in your poems.”
