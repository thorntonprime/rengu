The whole method begins and ends with a single method： COCTION.

Here is the grand arcanum： it is a celestial spirit, progeny of the
sun, moon and stars, which is rendered perfect in the saturnine object
by a continual cooking, until it has reached the state of sublimation
and power necessary to transform base metals into gold.  This
operation is accomplished by the hermetic fire. The separation of the
subtle from the gross must be performed with care, by continually
adding water; for the more the materials are terrestrial, the more
must they be diluted and rendered mobile. Continue this method until
the separated soul is reunited with the body.
