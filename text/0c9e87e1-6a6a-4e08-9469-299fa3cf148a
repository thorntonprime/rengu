Title: When the Violin
Description: January 8
---
When the violin can forgive the past it starts singing.
When the violin can stop worrying about the future
you will become such a drunk laughing nuisance
the Sun will then lean down and start combing you into its hair.
When the violin can forgive every wound caused by others
your soul, your soul will start singing.
