Title: These Candles, Our Bodies
Description: February 17
---
These candles, our bodies, see how they burn.

How many hours will they last—days, months, years?

Look at the warmth and comfort we can give to each other or to
anything that comes close.

One of the components of lasting art is a spirit flame within the
created

that can ignite inspiration and hope, and survive time’s ways.
