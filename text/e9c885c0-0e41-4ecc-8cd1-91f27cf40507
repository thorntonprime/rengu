Title: Joseph
Description: March 28
---
Joseph has come, the handsome one of this age,
a victory banner floating over spring flowers.

Those of you whose work it is to wake the dead,
get up. This is a work day.

The lion that hunts lions charges into the meadow.
Yesterday and the day before are gone.
The beautiful coin of now slaps down in your hand.

Start the drumbeat. Everything we have said
about the Friend is true. The beauty of that
peacefulness makes the whole world restless.

Spread your love-robe out to catch
what sifts down from the ninth level.

You heart closed up in a chest, open,
for the Friend is entering you.

You feet, it is time to dance.
Don't talk about the old man.

He is young again. And don't mention
the past. Do you understand?
The beloved is here.
