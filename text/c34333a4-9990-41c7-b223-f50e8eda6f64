      Let me now beg you to observe that the light of a Master Mason is
      darkness visible, serving .only to express that gloom which rests on
      the prospect of futurity.

      A dungeon horrible, on all sides round.
      As one great furnace flames, yet from those flames
      No light, but rather darkness visible
      Served only to discover sights of woe.

      Of darkness visible, so much be lent
      As half to show, half veil, the deep intent.

Do not as Babel does, which amuses and comforts itself with the
philosopher’s stone, and boasts of it, but keeps only a gross mason’s
stone shut up in poison and death, instead of the precious
philosopher’s stone： What is it for Babel to have the stone, when it
lies wholly shut up in Babel? It is as if a lord bestowed a country
upon me, which indeed was mine, but I could not take possession of it,
and remained still a poor man notwithstanding, and yet I boasted of
the dominion, and so had the name, and not the power： Even thus it
goes with Babel about the precious stone of the new-birth in Christ
Jesus.
