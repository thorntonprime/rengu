Try to enter your inner treasure-house and you will see the
treasure-house of heaven.  For both the one and the other are the
same, and one and the same entrance reveals them both. The ladder
leading to the kingdom is concealed within you. that is. in your soul.
Wash yourself from sin and you will see the rungs of the ladder by
which you ascend thither.
