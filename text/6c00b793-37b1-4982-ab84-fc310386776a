Our names we make to shine before the people.
But secretly our hearts we all have tarnished.
Each breath sees us commit sins by the thousand.
Yet not once in our life repent we one sin.
Yielding to self we sin and know no limit --
What shall we do, O God, how make repentance?
No one of us but knows his heartâ€™s sedition,
Yet we have come, thy mercy to petition.
