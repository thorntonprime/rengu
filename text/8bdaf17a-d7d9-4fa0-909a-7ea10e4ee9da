Let no one deem it difficult to arrive at this however hard may seem,
and be, indeed, to start with, the parting from and dying to all
things. Having once got into it no life is more easy, more delightful
or more lovely. God is so very careful to be always with a man to
guide him to himself in case of his taking the wrong way. No man ever
wanted anything so much as God wants to make the soul aware of him.
God is ever ready, but we are so unready. God is near to us, but we
are far from him. God is in, we are out; God is at home, we are
strangers.
