No one can ascend to that Heaven which is sought by you unless He Who
came down from a Heaven which you seek shall not first enlighten. Ye
seek an incorruptible Medicine, which shall not only transmute the
body from corruption into a perfect mode but so preserve it
continually; yet except in Heaven itself, never anywhere will you
discover it.
