And these Thy servants who are gathered to slay me, in zeal for Thy
religion and in desire to win Thy favour, forgive them, O Lord, and
have mercy upon them; for verily if Thou hadst revealed to them that
which Thou hast revealed to me, they would not have done what they
have done; and if Thou hadst hidden from me that which Thou hast
hidden from them, I should not have suffered this tribulation. Glory
unto Thee in whatsoever Thou doest, and glory unto Thee in whatsoever
Thou wiliest.
