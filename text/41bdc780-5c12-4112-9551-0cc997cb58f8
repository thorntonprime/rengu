Title: You DOn't Have to Act Crazy Anymore
Description: November 26
---
You don’t have to act crazy anymore; we all know you were good at
that.

Now retire, my dear, from all that hard work you do

of bringing pain to your sweet eyes and heart.

Look in the clear mountain mirror -- see the beautiful ancient warrior

and the divine elements you always carry inside

that infused this universe with sacred life so long ago

and that join you eternally with all existence -- with God!

You don’t have to act nuts anymore; we all know ... you were good at
that, now and then.
