    Description: A pundit devoted to Sri Ramakrishna
---
Sex-life with a woman! What happiness is there in that? The realization of God
gives ten million times more happiness. Gauri used to say that when a man
attains ecstatic love of God all the pores of the skin, even the roots of the
hair, become like so many sexual organs, and in every pore the aspirant enjoys
the happiness of communion with the Atman.
