We do not wholly rely upon God. but will have earthly and fleshly things with
it. This is impossible, such things offend God and move Him to anger. God
must be alone, without a competitor. ... Hence it comes that courageous
persons and such as with magnanimity wholly give up themselves -- that is,
who wholly deny and sink themselves in God -- cannot bear (without the utmost
discontent) that one should deal with God so cowardly, as to hold sometimes
with Him and sometimes with the world, in that they well know that this comes
from the failings of such persons and that all their uneasiness is owing to
their timidity or reserve towards God. They cannot well refrain from telling
such persons of it. which however offends them -- yea. often makes them have
an aversion for those that inform them of their failings; since, according to
their self-love, they would rather that we should bewail them and look on
their grievance with compassion; nay, they would have us believe it to be
God’s workings. But these enlightened and courageous souls do not choose to
act in such a manner： they must give evidence to the truth, which self-love
in the others cannot endure.
