mountain sounds carry a chill wisdom
an upwelling spring whispers subtle tales
pine breezes stir the fire beneath my tea
bamboo shadows soak deep into my robe

I grind my ink： clouds scraping across the crags
copy out a verse： birds settling on branches
as the world rolls right on by
its every turn tracing out non-action
