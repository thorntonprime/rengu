There is no existence for the unreal and the real can never be non-existent.
The Seers of Truth know the nature and final ends of both.

Know That to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one is ever
able to destroy that Immutable.

These bodies are perishable; but the Dweller in these bodies is eternal,
indestructible and impenetrable. Therefore fight, O descendant of Bharata!

He who considers this (Self) as a slayer or he who thinks that this (Self)
is slain, neither of these knows the Truth. For It does not slay, nor is
It slain.

This (Self) is never born, nor does It die, nor after once having been, does
It go into non-being. This (Self) is unborn, eternal, changeless, ancient.
It is never destroyed even when the body is destroyed.
