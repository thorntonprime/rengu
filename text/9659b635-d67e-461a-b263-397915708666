I beseech you the executioners, crucify me thus, with the head
downward and not otherwise ： ... concerning which the Lord saith in a
mystery： Unless ye make the things of the right hand as those of the
left, and those of the left as those of the right, and those that are
above as those below, and those that are behind as those that are
before, ye shall not have knowledge of the kingdom.
