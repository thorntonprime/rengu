That man is more praiseworthy who, having an evil nature, controls and
governs himself in opposition to the impulse of that nature, than he who,
having a good disposition, leads a good life, and should he go astray,
returns to the right; as it is more praiseworthy to manage a bad horse
than one that is not vicious.
