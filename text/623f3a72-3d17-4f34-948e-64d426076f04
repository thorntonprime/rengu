I look forward with joy to the wild animals held in readiness for me,
and I pray that they may attack me; ... come fire and cross and
grapplings with wild beasts, wrenching of bones, hacking of limbs,
crushings of my whole body; only be it mine to attain unto Jesus
Christ. ... I am God’s wheat, and I am ground by the teeth of wild
beasts, that I may be found Christ’s pure bread.
