I wonder at those who seek His temple in this worldï¼š why do not they
seek contemplation of Him in their hearts? The temple they sometimes
attain and sometimes miss, but contemplation they might enjoy always.
If they are bound to visit a stone, which is looked at only once a
year, surely they are more bound to visit the temple of the heart,
where He may be seen three hundred and sixty times in a day and night.
But the mystic's every step is a symbol of the journey to Mecca, and
when he reaches the sanctuary he wins a robe of honour for every step.
