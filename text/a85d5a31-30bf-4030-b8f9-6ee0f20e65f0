God lays the soul in His glowing heart so that He, the great God, and she, the
humble maid, embrace and are one as water with wine. ...

My body is in long torment, my soul in high delight, for she has seen and
embraced her Beloved. Through Him, alas for her! she suffers torment. As He
draws her to Himself, she gives herself to Him. She cannot hold back and so He
takes her to Himself. Gladly would she speak but dares not. She is engulfed in
the glorious Trinity in high union. He gives her a brief respite that she may
long for Him. She would fain sing His praises but cannot. She would that He
might send her to Hell, if only He might be loved above all measure by all
creatures. She looks at Him and says. ‘Lord! Give me Thy blessing!’ He looks at
her and draws her to Him with a greeting the body may not know --

Thus the body speaks to the soul
‘Where hast thou been? I can bear this no more!'
And the soul replies ‘Silence! Thou art a fool!
I will be with my Love
Even shouldst thou never recover!
I am His joy： He is my torment --'
