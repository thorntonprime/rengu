Who is he who pleaseth God? He whom God hath pleased. God cannot
displease Himself. May He please thee also, that thou mayest please
Him. But He cannot please thee, except thou hast displeased thyself.
But if thou displeasest thyself, remove thine eyes from thyself. For
why dost thou regard thyself? For if thou truly regard thyself, thou
findest in thee what will displease thee; and thou sayest to God, ‘My
sin is always before me’ (Ps. L, 5 --  Douay). Let thy sin be before
thee, that it may not be before God; and refuse to be before thyself,
that thou mayest be before God. For as we wish that God may not turn
away His face from us, so do we wish that He may turn His face from
our sins. ...  If thou turn not away thy face from them, thou art
thyself angry with thy sins, and if thou turn not away thy face from
thy sins, thou dost confess them and God will pardon them.
