Happiness is nothing else, as we usually describe it to ourselves, but
the enjoyment of some chief good; and therefore the Deity is so
boundlessly happy, because it is every way one with its own immense
perfection; and every thing so much the more feelingly lives upon
happiness, by how much the more it comes to partake of God. and to be
made like to him And, as it is impossible to enjoy happiness without a
fruition of God; so it is impossible to enjoy him without an
assimilation and conformity of our natures to him in a way of true
goodness and godlike perfection.
