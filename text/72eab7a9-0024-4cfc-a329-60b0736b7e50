Why have I not performed the Pilgrimage? It is no great matter that
thou shouldst tread under thy feet a thousand miles of ground in order
to visit a stone house. The true man of God sits where he is. and the
Bayt al-Ma'mûr comes several times in a day and night to visit him and
perform the circumambulation above his head. Look and see!
