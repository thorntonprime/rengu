As a thread does not pass through an unbored pearl, so the teachings
of the Queen did not influence the heart of the King. O Rama-ji,
unless the pupil himself meditates and reflects and puts the teaching
into practice with interest and perseverance, even the words of Brahma
Himself fall flat on his ears. The reason is that Atman knows Itself
and is not the object of reason or the senses.
