Men of wisdom exhort us： ‘Do not cry for the perishable.' Weep not for the
dead. Stand firmly fixed in the consciousness of your immortal Existence and
see as an unperturbed witness, the passing vicissitudes of life, just as you
witness the clouds that pass before your gaze. Let us watch the divine play
on the world stage. People appear on it and disappear from it. The world is a
passing show. We are the sun of Truth and the world a flitting panorama like
the clouds. Whatever has name and form must change and vanish.  It is only
that immortal Truth, Spirit or God, that nameless, formless, birthless and
deathless Reality -- with which we are one -- that never changes and ever
exists
