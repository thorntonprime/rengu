Now God, though He is absolutely immaterial, can alone by His own power
produce matter by creation; and so He alone can produce a form in matter,
without the aid of any preceding material form Therefore, as no pre-existing
body had been formed, through whose power another body of the same species
could be generated, the first human body was of necessity made immediately
by God.
