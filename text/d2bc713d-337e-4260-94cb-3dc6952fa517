The consciousness that ‘This is I’ is like the shadow of night and is
dispelled by the rising of the sun of true knowledge. Think neither of
the entity nor the non-entity of yourself or others. Preserve the
tranquillity of your mind, by ignoring the thought of both positive
and negative existence, and be rid of the sense of distinction between
cause and effect.
