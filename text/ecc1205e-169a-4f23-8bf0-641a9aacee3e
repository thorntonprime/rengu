Title: Forgiveness Is the Cash
---
Forgiveness is the cash you need. All the other kinds of silver really
buy just strange things.

Everything has its music. Everything has the genes of God inside.

But learn from those courageous addicted lovers of glands and ganja
and gold --

look, they cannot jump high or chuckle long when they are whirling.

And the moon and the stars become sad when their tender light is used
for night wars.

Forgiveness is part of the treasure you need to craft your falcon
wings

and return to your true realm, our true realm of divine freedom.
