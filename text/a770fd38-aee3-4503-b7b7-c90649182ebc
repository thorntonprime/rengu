‘Behold the savage beast with the pointed tail, that passes mountains,
and breaks through walls and weapons; behold him that pollutes the
whole world.’

Thus began my guide to speak to me; and beckoned him to come ashore,
near the end of our rocky path;

and that uncleanly image of Fraud came onward, and landed his head and
bust, but drew not his tail upon the bank.

His face was the face of a just man, so mild an aspect had it
outwardly; and the rest was all a reptile’s body.
