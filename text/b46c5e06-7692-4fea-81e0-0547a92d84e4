I spoke a word, and the word glorified Me;
then of the glorifying of the word created I a light and a darkness.
Of the light I created the spirits of such as believe,
and of the darkness created I the spirits of such as disbelieve.
Then I mingled the light with the darkness,
and made it to be a stone-jewel;
the jewelness was of the light,
and the stoniness was of the darkness.
