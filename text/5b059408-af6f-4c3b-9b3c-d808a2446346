This pearl of eternity is the peace and joy of God within thee, but can only
be found by the manifestation of the life and power of Jesus Christ in thy
soul. But Christ cannot be thy power and thy life till, in obedience to His
call, thou deniest thyself, takest up thy daily cross and followest Him in
the regeneration. This is peremptory, it admits of no reserve or evasion, it
is the one way to Christ and eternal life. But be where thou wilt, either
here or at Rome or Geneva, if self is undenied, if thou livest to thine own
will, to the pleasures of thy natural lust and appetites, senses, and
passions, and in conformity to the vain customs and spirit of this world,
thou art dead whilst thou livest, ... a stranger to all that is holy and
heavenly within thee and utterly incapable of finding the peace and joy of
God in thy soul.
