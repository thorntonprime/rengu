Title: Be Your Note
Description: April 11
---
Remember the lips where wind-breath
originated, and let your note be clear.

Don't try to end it.
Be your note.

I'll show you how it's enough.
Go up on the roof at night
in this city of the soul.

Let everyone climb on their roofs
and sing their notes.

Sing loud!
