The most terrible pain in hell is the pain of perdition -- namely, the
loss of God. Those who have gratuitously betrayed Him in time have to
bear in hell His eternal privation, and this torment surpasses all
their torments. Since in scorning God they have burned for creatures
with an unjust fire, they are condemned beyond that to eternal fire.
Fire answers fire He who loves not God and who dies in coldness will
eternally shiver to the depths of his being in a cold without end. He
will be frozen for having scorned true love; he will be burned for
having adored false love. Cold summons, cold answers. Fire summons,
fire answers. ... I urge you to believe me, for I know whereof I
speak.
