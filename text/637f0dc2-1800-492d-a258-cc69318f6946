      The translation of the Bible is in error where it says that man was
      created in the image of God. The “in" should be left out so that it
      reads.“ Man IS the image of God.” The word “in” does not appear in
      the original. ... Man gets rid of the idea that he is not God by
      refusing to accept the negative statements. The statement. “I am God.”
      held habitually as the secret fact within his own nature, frees him
      from the negative statement that he is not God. It is always better to
      state the Truth than the untruth God is the beginning and is the Great
      Servant of mankind. To receive His spirit is to become the Sons of
      God, and then our attitude toward the world is to bestow our great
      gifts upon all around us, a gracious and generous service.

For I tell thee truly, that the devil hath his contemplatives as God hath
his.
