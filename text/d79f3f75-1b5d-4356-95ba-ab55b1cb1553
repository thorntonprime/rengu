Commentary: Mother secret and hidden is the antiphon to the Blessed
  Virgin for Advent
---
Mary was singularly hidden during her life. It is on this account that
the Holy Ghost and the Church call her Alma Mater -- ‘Mother secret
and hidden’. Her humility was so profound that she had no inclination
on earth more powerful or more constant than that of hiding herself,
from herself as well as from every other creature, so as to be known
to God only.
