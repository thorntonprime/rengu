The gist of the whole matter lies in the fact that the small and weak
cannot aid that which is itself small and weak, and a combustible
substance cannot shield another substance from combustion. That which
is to protect another substance against combustion must itself be safe
from danger. The latter must be stronger than the former, that is to
say, it must itself be essentially incombustible. He, then, who would
prepare the incombustible sulphur of the Sages, must look for our
sulphur in a substance in which it is incombustible.
