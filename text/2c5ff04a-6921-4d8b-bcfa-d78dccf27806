Title: A Tree You Can Wind Around
Description: March 15
---
I am the one always near. There are so many ways to touch me now. If
you sing, your sounds will press against my cheek in a way I desire.
If you dance I will become the ground you bless, as happiness does
this world. And if you make love with another form and can satisfy it,
any sighs of respite -- any congratulating noises -- are also mine.

This is just the way things have now become, in short： more delicious
our lives. One day, my angel, you will realize you accomplish
everything just by appearing amongst us.

If I thought you heard what I just said and could cash that in -- walk
off a wealthy person, I could spare myself repeating it, but I don’t
mind.

There is really nothing more you can do for us than you having ...
ever been. From a realization came dawn and every benevolent wave that
still spreads out exploring the endlessness of time.
