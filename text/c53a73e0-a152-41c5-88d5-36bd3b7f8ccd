Title: To Darkness
Description: February 15
---
You, darkness, of whom I am born --

I love you more than the flame
that limits the world
to the circle it illumines
and excludes all the rest.

But the dark embraces everythingï¼š
shapes and shadows, creatures and me,
people, nations -- just as they are.
