Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek
after her. and will go before them in the way of justice.

And he that loveth her. loveth life. ...

If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be
in assurance.

For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth
him.

She will bring upon him fear and dread and trialï¼š and she will scourge
him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her
laws, and trust his soul.

Then she will strengthen him. and make a straight way to him. and give
him joy.

And will disclose her secrets to him. and will heap upon him treasures
of knowledge and understanding of justice.

But if he go astray, she will forsake him. and deliver him into the
hands of his enemy.
