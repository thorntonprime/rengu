Title: Nothing Like a Yesterday
Description: March 1
---
When was the last time you felt complete, so complete, nothing dared
approach you?

Nothing like a yesterday, or a tomorrow. Nothing that could speak.

Nothing that could ever point to something that would ever need to be
done.

Nothing that could not do anything, anything but adore you. Adore you.
Adore.
