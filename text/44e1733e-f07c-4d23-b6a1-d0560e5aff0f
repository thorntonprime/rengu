Title: The Great Work of Sunrise
Description: May 24
By: Thomas Merton
---
The great work of sunrise again today.

The awful solemnity of it. The sacredness. Unbearable without prayer and
worship. I mean unbearable if you really put everything else aside and see what
is happening! Many, no doubt, are vaguely aware that it is dawn, but they are
protected from the solemnity of it by the neutralizing worship of their own
society, their own world, in which the sun no longer rises and sets.

Sense of importance, the urgency of seeing, fully aware, experiencing what is
hereï¼š not what is given by men, by society, but what is given by God and
hidden by (even monastic) society. Clear realization that I must begin with
these first elements. That it is absurd to inquire after my function in the
world, or whether I have one as long as I am not first of all alive and awake.
And if that, and no more, is my job (for it is certainly every man's job), then
I am grateful for it. The vanity of all false missions, when no one is sent.
All the universal outcry of people who have not been told to cry out, but who
are driven to this noise by their fear, their lack of what is right in front of
their noses.
