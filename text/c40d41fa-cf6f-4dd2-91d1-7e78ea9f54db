\‘Grant me grace for all men’ (said Bâyazîd al-Bistâmî in a moment of
spiritual ecstasy).

\‘O Bâyazîd,’ said a voice, ‘raise thine eyes.’

He raised his eyes and saw that the Lord, may He be exalted! was even
more disposed than he himself in indulgence for His slaves. And he
grew bold to ask：

\‘O God! be merciful even to Satan.'

Came the reply： ‘Satan is of fire; fire unto fire; make it thy study
not to merit the fire.’
