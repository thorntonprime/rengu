God is the helper of the helpless and the strength of the weak. He
stood by the side of the saints in their hour of trial.

So long as the Lord of Elephants trusted in his own strength he was
defeated.

The moment he forgot his own strength, and in his weakness called upon
the Lord, God was at hand to help him -- even before His name was
half-uttered.

Draupadi in her helplessness called upon the Lord.

Dushasana was worsted in his effort to unclothe her; for the Lord
became her clothing.

Try as one may the power of asceticism, or physical or temporal might,
a man is bound to fail.

Verily the strength of the defeated is the name of the Lord.
