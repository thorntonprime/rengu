Title: They Are Holding a Ball
Description: January 21
---
When there is a lot of confusion, the result is usually sadness.
Clarity and order, what is their worth, what follows them?

Any congested lanes of traffic inside come to a halt, carriages are
abandoned and moved off the road, horses get turned out to graze in
the firmament.

Freed from maintenance of small spaces and petty things, something
might raise your chin -- an invisible arm, your dimension can shift.

And the wonders you forgot are still there waiting to play.

There is an expanded field where all things are ever new. All objects
there are holding a ball they wish to toss,

just wanting you to have some lighthearted fun, catching light.
