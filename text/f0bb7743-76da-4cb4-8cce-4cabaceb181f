When a deer is being pursued by the hunters, it does not stop even to
look around for its fellows or look back at its pursuers, but with all
eagerness, hastens straight forward, and no matter' how many may be
following, it escapes in safety. It is with the same determination
that a man fully entrusts himself to the Buddha’s power, and without
regard to anything else, steadfastly sets his mind upon being born
into the Pure Land.
