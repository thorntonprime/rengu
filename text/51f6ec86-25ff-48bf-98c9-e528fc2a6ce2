Title: When His Foot Touches Earth Near Me
Description: January 12
---
Not like a lone beautiful bird, these poems now rise in great white
flocks, startled by God,

breaking a branch, when His foot touches earth ... near me.

Not like a lone beautiful bird need be your heart when I am close,
like this.
