Title: Lie Around and Get Zonked Out
Description: March 30
---
If we were smarter, it would have been enough that just one great
Prophet would have to make a personal appearance on earth.

He or She probably could have easily fixed some important things
forever, written a book that really gave us the total lowdown ... and
that no right-wing fanatic dare edit.

God in human form, as some called the Avatar -- or World Teacher --
seemingly could have easily shown us some tasty herb cocktails

that could cure any illness humans would ever know. But looks like it
does not work that way.

And what of us mules who like the harness? What would the workhorses
in this world do without some imaginary cause -- or situation -- we
felt needed to be championed, or scotch-taped?

Heaven forbid, everyone might become happy doing basically nothing

except to lie around and get zonked out on the wonder of our being.
