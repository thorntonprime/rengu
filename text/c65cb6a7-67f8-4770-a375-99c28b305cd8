Title: Brings Life to a Field
Description: April 19
---
It is not possible to complete yourself without sorrow.

Sorrow is a vital ingredient that shapes the heart and enriches it.

So endure sadness the best you can when its season comes.

That rain that can fall from your eye brings life to a field,

and on other days when you laugh, a sun takes birth in a sky you will
someday know.

See how all the elements are inside of you.

See how your soul is a sire of light.
