    Filiation
By: Philalethes
Commentary: |
  As many alchemical citations appear in this book, it may be well to
  remind the reader that alchemy 'initiatically' is the spiritual
  perspective which objectifies the interior work in terms of chemical
  processes. Man is the oven, the heart the vessel, spirit the fire, and
  the elements of the soul the raw material which has to be transmuted
  through ‘Mercurial’ or spiritual influences into the final Stone or
  \‘powder’, capable in turn of transforming ‘base metals’ into gold --
  an operation which is the hallmark of the adept's realized state.

And this is the true key of the work -- to incrudate the mature by the
conjunction of an immature -- being incrudated to calcine it -- being
calcined to dissolve it -- and all this philosophically, not vulgarly.
