Title: Inhabitants on Other Planets
Description: May 22
---
I am wondering if someone slipped something in my tea about an hour ago? I feel
like I am on some mindaltering drug. And everything is telling me jokes.

You know it is not beyond God to take pity on many down here. He might just
surprise you someday and grind a few million tons of opium into a fine dust

and then sprinkle it over your house so that you stop complaining.

You might have to shovel your way out, as if a big snow came along, smoking
it -- breathing it in all the time as it were.

Maybe God does that routinely for inhabitants on other planets who donâ€™t take
politics and gender so seriously ... or something.
