The Way does not itself produce results in men. but those who do
produce such results need the Way for the production. The foot marches
on the road and so moves onï¼š but the road which is marched on needs to
be a non-marching thing, for the body needs hand and foot if it is to
move and thereby depends on something which does not move. Thus it is
that sometimes the thing which is useless and yet useful is needed to
produce results, and the non-production of results is, as it were,
what (everything) depends on.
