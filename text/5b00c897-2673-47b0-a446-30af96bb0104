By: William Law

There is nothing that so sanctifies the heart of man, that keeps us in
such habitual love, prayer, and delight in God; nothing that so kills
all the roots of evil in our nature, that so renews and perfects all
our virtues, that fills us with so much love, goodness, and good
wishes to every creature as this faith that God is always present in
us with His light and Holy Spirit.
