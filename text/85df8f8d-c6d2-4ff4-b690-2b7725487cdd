Every part therefore of the bodies, perishing either in death or after
it, in the grave or wheresoever, shall be restored, renewed, and from
a natural and corruptible body it shall become immortal, spiritual,
and incorruptible. Be it all made into powder and dust, by chance or
cruelty, or dissolved into air or water, so that no part remain
undispersed, yet shall it not, yet can it not be kept hidden from the
omnipotency of the Creator, who will not have one hair of the head to
perish. Thus shall the spiritual flesh become subject to the spirit,
yet shall it be flesh still, as the carnal spirit before was subject
to the flesh, and yet a spirit still.
