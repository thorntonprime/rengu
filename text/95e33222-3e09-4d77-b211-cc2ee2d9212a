Wouldst thou know for certain whether thy sufferings are thine own or God's?
Tell by these tokens. Suffering for thyself, in whatever way. the suffering
hurts thee and is hard to bear. But suffering for God and God alone thy
suffering hurts thee not nor does it burden thee, for God bears the load.
Believe me. if there were a man willing to suffer on account of God and of
God alone, then though he fell a sudden prey to the collective sufferings of
all the world it would not trouble him nor bow him down, for God would be the
bearer of his burden.
