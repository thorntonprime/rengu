From the time that the first man opened his ears to the voice of the Enemy,
he became deaf thereby, and all we after him, so that we cannot hear or
understand the sweet voice of the Eternal Word. Yet we know that the Eternal
Word is still ... unutterably nigh to us inwardly, in the very principle of
our being And it is ever speaking in man; but he hears it not by reason of
the sore deafness that has come upon him. ... The cause whereof is that the
Enemy has whispered in his ear, and he has listened to the voice, and hence
has he grown deaf and dumb. What is this most hurtful whispering of the Enemy?
It is every disorderly image or suggestion that starts up in thy mind,
whether belonging to thy creature likings and wishes, or the world and the
things thereof; whether it be thy wealth, reputation, friends or relations,
or thy own flesh, or whatever it be that lays hold of thy fancy, making thee
to like or do somewhat. ... Not only worldly but also religious men are liable
to this deafness, if they make the creature their idol and aim, and their hearts
are possessed therewith. The Devil has marked this, and suggests to them the
imaginations to which he finds them inclined. With some their ears are stopped
up with their own inventions, and the daily routine of habit with which they go
through certain outward acts.
