Let therefore even the whole universe, that greatest and most perfect flock of
the God who IS, say, ‘The Lord shepherds me, and nothing shall fail me’ (Ps,
xxiii. 1) ... . For it cannot be that there should be any lack of a fitting
portion, when God rules, whose wont it is to bestow good in fullness and
perfection on all that is.
