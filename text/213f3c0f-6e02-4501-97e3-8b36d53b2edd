Title: Scatterbrain Sweetness
---
There is a glory that breathes life back into a corpse
and brings strangers together as friends.

Call that one back who fills the held-out robe
of a thornbush with flowers, who clears muddied minds,
who gives a two-day-old infant wisdom
beyond anyone's learning. What baby? you ask.

There is a fountain, a passion circulating.
I am not saying this well because I am too much
in the scatterbrain sweetness. Listen anyway.

It must be said. There are eyes that see into eternity.
A presence beyond the power and magic of shamans.

Let that in. Sink to the floor, full prostration.
