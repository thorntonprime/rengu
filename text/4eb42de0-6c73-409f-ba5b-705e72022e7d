Such a (disciple of philosophy) may be compared to a man who has
fallen among wild beasts -- he will not join in the wickedness of his
fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce
natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State
or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his
life without doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his
peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm of dust
and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the
shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness,
he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil
or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright
hopes.
