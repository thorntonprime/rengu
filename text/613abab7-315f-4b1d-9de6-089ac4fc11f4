O truly sacred mysteries! O pure light! In the blaze of the torches I
have a vision of heaven and of God. I become holy by initiation： The
Lord reveals the mysteries; He marks the worshipper with His seal,
gives light to guide his way, and commends him, when he has believed,
to the Father’s care, where he is guarded for ages to come.  These are
the revels of my mysteries! If thou wilt, be thyself also initiated,
and thou shalt dance with angels around the unbegotten and
imperishable and only true God, the Word of God joining with us in our
hymn of praise.
