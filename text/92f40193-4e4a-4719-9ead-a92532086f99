By burning anything to ashes you may gain its salt. If in this dissolution
the sulphur and mercury be kept apart, and restored to its salt, you may
once more obtain that form which was destroyed by the process of combustion.
This assertion the wise of this world denounce as the greatest folly,
and count as a rebellion, saying that such a transformation would amount
to a new creation, and that God has denied such creative power to sinful man.
But the folly is all on their side. For they do not understand that our
Artist does not claim to create anything, but only to evolve new things
from the seed made ready to his hand by the Creator.
