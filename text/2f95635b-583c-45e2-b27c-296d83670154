\'This man and that man is born in herâ€™, says the Holy Ghost through the Royal
Psalmist. According to the explanation of some of the Fathers, the first man
that is born in Mary is the Man-God. Jesus Christ; the second is a mere man.
the child of God and Mary by adoption. If Jesus Christ the Head of men is born
in her. the predestinate, who are members of that Head, ought also to be born
in her. by a necessary consequence. ... As she is the dawn which precedes and
reveals the Sun of Justice. Who is Jesus Christ, she must be seen and
recognized in order that Jesus Christ may also be. ... In seeing her. we see
our pure nature. She is not the sun. which by the brightness of its rays blinds
us because of our weakness; but she is fair and gentle as the moon, which
receives the light of the sun. and tempers it to make it more suitable to our
capacity. She is so charitable that she repels none of those who ask her
intercession, no matter how great sinners they have been; for, as the saints
say, never has it been heard since the world was the world that anyone has
confidently and perseveringly had recourse to our Blessed Lady and yet has been
repelled. She is so powerful that none of her petitions has ever been refused.
