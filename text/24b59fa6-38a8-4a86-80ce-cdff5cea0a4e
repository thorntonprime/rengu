We must come without the will to get or the will to avoid, just as the
wayfarer asks the man he meets which of two ways leads anywhere, not
wanting the right hand to be the road rather than the left, for he
does not wish to go one particular road, but the road which leads to
his goal. We ought to approach God as we approach a guide, dealing
with Him as we deal with our eyes, not beseeching them to show us one
sort of things rather than another, but accepting the impressions of
things as they are shown us.
