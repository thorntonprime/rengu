It is certainly true that all composite substances are liable to
decomposition; that this decomposition, when it takes place in the animal
world, is called death; and that the human body is a substance compounded
of the four elements. But it is also true that the elements of Paradise,
where man was created, are not subject to this law, seeing that they are
most pure and incorruptible heavenly essences; and if man had remained in
this pure and celestial region, his body would have been incapable of
natural decay. Adam, however, in an evil day for our race, disobeyed his
Creator, and straightway was driven forth to the beasts, into the world
of corruptible elements which God had created for the beasts only. From
that day forward his food was derived from perishable substances, and
death began to work in his members. The pure elements of his creation were
gradually mingled and infected with the corruptible elements of the outer
world, and thus his body became more and more gross, and liable, through
its grossness, to natural decay and death.  The process of degeneration was,
of course, slow in the case of Adam and his first descendants; but, as time
went on, the seed out of which men were generated became more and more
infected with perishable elements. The continued use of corruptible food
rendered their bodies more and more grossâ€”and human life was soon
shortened to a very brief span indeed.
