A desire arises in the mind. It is satisfied： immediately another
comes. In the interval which separates two desires a perfect calm
reigns in the mind. It is at this moment freed from all thought
(sankalpa). love or hate. Complete peace (shânti) equally reigns
between two mental waves (vrittis).

When the mind is concentrated on Brahman or the supreme Self, it
becomes one with it.  like camphor with the flame, or salt with water,
or water with milk. The mind is dissolved in Brahman and becomes of
the nature of Brahman. There is no longer duality. The person
meditating has become Brahman, and this is the state of liberation
(kaivalya).
