And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between
them in vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe
unto those who disbelieve, from the Fire!

Or shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who
spread corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the
wicked?

A Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing, that
they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may
reflect.
