It may be generally much better for us, while we are so apt to magnify and
court any mundane beauty and glory, as we are, that providence should
disorder and deface these things, that we might all be weaned from the love
of them, than that their lovely looks should so bewitch and enchant our souls
as to draw them off from better things. And I dare say, that a sober mind
that shall contemplate the state and temper of menâ€™s minds, and the confused
frame of this outward world, will rather admire the infinite wisdom of a
gracious providence in permitting and ordering that ataxy which is in it,
than he would were it to be beheld in a more comely frame and order.
