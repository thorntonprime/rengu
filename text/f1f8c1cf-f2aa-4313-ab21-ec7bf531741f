Man attains perfection, being engaged in his own duty. Hear now how
one engaged in his own duty attains perfection.

Him from Whom is the evolution of all beings, by Whom all this is
pervaded, by worshipping Him with his own duty man attains perfection.

Better is one’s own duty, although imperfect, than that of another
well performed. He Conform.  who does the duty born of his own nature
incurs no sin. 180

O son of Kunti, one should not relinquish the duty to which he is
born, though it is defective, for all undertakings are surrounded by
evil as fire by smoke.
