It is told how Jesus, son of Mary, met an old man on a mountain, who lived in
the open air without shelter against heat and cold. ‘Why dost thou not build
a house?' he asked him.

‘O Spirit of God’, replied the old man, ‘prophets before thee predicted that
I would only live for 700 years; therefore it is not worth my trouble to
settle down.’
