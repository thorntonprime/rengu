Time is an unwholesome physician, for it deceives the patient daily with the
expectation of the future, and before expelling the old pains, it adds new
ones to the old and accumulates daily so many evils that through the
fallacious hope of life it leads to death.  We must live todayï¼š he who lives
tomorrow never lives. If you want to live today, live for God, in whom
yesterday and tomorrow are naught but today.
