  - Beauty-Peace=Beauty=The Uncreate Source of Beauty

The Nature, then, which creates things so lovely must be itself of a far
earlier beauty; we, undisciplined in discernment of the inward, knowing

which stirs us; we are in the case of one who sees his own reflection but not
realizing whence it comes goes in pursuit of it.
