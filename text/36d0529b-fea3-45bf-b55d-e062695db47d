  The great Sufi referenced is Al Hallâj. He had recently been
  executed, and Kalâbâdhi deemed it preferable to keep his citations
  anonymous, knowing that Sufis would readily identify the source.

Benefactor, and confessing (His) lordship.’ ...

One of the great Sufis said： ‘Gratitude consists in being unconscious
of gratitude through the vision of the Benefactor.’
