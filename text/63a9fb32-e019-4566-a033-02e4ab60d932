If it is literally true what our Lord said, that His Kingdom was not of this
world, then it is a truth of the same certainty, that no one is a member of
this kingdom but he that, in the literal sense of the words, renounces the
spirit of this world. Christians might as well part with half the Articles of
their Creed, or but half believe them, as really to refuse or but by halves
enter into these self-denials.
