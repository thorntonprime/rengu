Transmute the nature, and you will find what you want. For in our
Magistery we obtain first from the gross the subtle, or the spirit;
then from the moist the dry, i.e., earth from water. Thus we transmute
the corporeal into the spiritual, and the spiritual into the
corporeal, the lowest into the highest, and the highest into the
lowest.
