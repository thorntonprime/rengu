For it behoves the mind that would be led forth and let go free to
withdraw itself from the influence of everything, the needs of the
body, the organs of sense, specious arguments, the plausibilities of
reasoning, last of all itself. For this reason Abraham glories saying
‘The Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me
out of my father’s house’ (Gen. xxiv. 7)： for it is not possible that
he whose abode is in the body and the mortal race should attain to
being with God： this is possible only for him whom God rescues out of
the prison When the soul in all utterances and all actions has
attained to perfect sincerity and godlikeness, the voices of the
senses cease and all those abominable sounds that used to vex it. ...
All these cease when the mind goes forth from the city of the soul and
finds in God the spring and aim of its own doings and intents.
