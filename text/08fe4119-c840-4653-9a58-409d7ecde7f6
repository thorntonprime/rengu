Title: Why Saadi Sits Alone
Description: April 17
Glossary:
  Person: Saadi Shirazi, Sheikh Mosleh al-Din
  Born: c 1184
  Died: 1283
  Description: Better known as Saadi, [he] was one of the major Persian
    poets of the medieval period. His still very popular work is
    recognized not only for the quality of his writing but also for the
    depth of his social thought. A famous poem of his is displayed in the
    United Nations building in New York.  President Obama brought
    world-wide attention to that poem in 2009, when he recited it for the
    commemoration of Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Emerson translated some
    of Saadi’s work. And Hafiz considered Saadi a hero—and teacher— as he
    was growing up. Hafiz was born nearly 40 years after Saadi died. Their
    tombshrines, both in Shiraz, are considered the jewels of that
    city.

Your destiny is winding toward the Perfect.

Someday you will be like Saadi, who sits alone in wonder,

unable to part from the Darling One, from the Complete, each of us is
becoming.
