He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light, and
measured for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years,
and the reckoning.  Allâh created not all that save in truth. He
detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge.

Lo! in the difference of day and night and all that Allâh hath created
in the heavens and the earth are portents, verily, for the
God-fearing.
