Title: Like a Winter Coat
Description: March 2
---
Names have started to admit their inabilities. I am glad they are
being honest.

Honesty always helps; there are fewer chores then to attend.

Labels shield one from the truth; they are like a winter coat in a
way --

who wants to wear one in this summer we can spend with you, playing?
