Title: Soul, Heart, and Body One Morning
---
There is a morning when presence comes over your soul.
You sing like a rooster in your earth-colored shape.

Your heart hears and, no longer frantic, begins to dance.
At that moment, soul reaches total emptiness.

Your heart becomes Mary, miraculously pregnant,
and your body, like a two-day-old Jesus, says wisdom words.

Now the heart, which is the source of your loving,
turns to universal light, and the body
picks up the tempo in the elegance of its motion.

Where Shams Tabriz walks the footprints become
notations of music and holes you fall through into space.
