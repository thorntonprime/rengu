Title: Why I Am Happy
---
Now has come, an easy time. I let it
roll. There is a lake somewhere

so blue and far nobody owns it.
A wind comes by and a willow listens
gracefully.

I hear all this, every summer. I laugh
and cry for every turn of the world,
its terribly cold, innocent spin.
That lake stays blue and freeï¼š it goes
on and on.

And I know where it is.
