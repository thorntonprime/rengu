Philosophers ador’d the Night, accounting it to have some great
Mystery and Deity in it.  The Night of Christ’s Cross hath very much
Mysterious and Divine in it. They that go down into the Deep, see the
Wonders o f the Lord, Psal. 107.23. ’Tis true of a deep of Woes, as
well as Waters. He that is content to enter into the Cloud, and the
saddest Retreat of it. meets with Wonders and Secrets of Glory.
