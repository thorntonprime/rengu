Title: How We Move Inside Grace (I)
Description: March 29
---
When our water here
becomes saturated with pollution,
it gets led back to the original water, the ocean.

After a year of receiving starlight,
the water returns, sweeping new robes along.

Where have you been? In the ocean of purity.
Now I am ready for more cleaning work.
If there were no impurity, what would water do?
It shows its glory in how it washes a face,
and in other qualities as well,
the way it grows the grass
and lifts a ship across to another port.

When the river slows with the weight of silt
and corrruption, it grows sad and prays,
Lord, what you gave me I gave others.
Is there more? Can you give more?

Clouds draw the water up to become rain;
the ocean takes the river back into itself.

What this means is
we often need to be refreshed.
