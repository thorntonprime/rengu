Commentary: In damnation, unlike transmigration, the human or
  central state is maintained, but inverted, following the
  descending or ‘infernal' direction of the world axis.

Our Lady stretched out her hands, and bright rays came forth which
seemed to penetrate into the earth. All at once the ground vanished,
and the children found themselves standing on the brink of a sea of
fire. As they peered into this dreadful place, the terrified
youngsters saw huge numbers of devils and damned souls.  The devils
resembled hideous black animals, each filling the air with despairing
shrieks. The damned souls were in their human bodies and seemed to be
brown in color, tumbling about constantly in the flames and screaming
with terror. All were on fire within and without their bodies, and
neither devils nor damned souls seemed able to control their
movements.  They were tossing about in the flames like fiery coals in
a furnace.  There was never an instant’s peace or freedom from pain.
