Come, whoever is clean of all pollution and whose soul has not
consciousness of sin.  Come, whosoever hath lived a life of
righteousness and justice. Come all ye who are pure of heart and of
hand, and whose speech can be understood. Whosoever hath not clean
hands, a pure soul, and an intelligible voice must not assist at the
Mysteries.
