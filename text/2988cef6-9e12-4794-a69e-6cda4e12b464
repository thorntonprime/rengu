Hogen, a Chinese Zen teacher, lived alone in a small temple in
the country. One day four traveling monks appeared and asked if
they might make a fire in his yard to warm themselves.

While they were building the fire, Hogen heard them arguing
about subjectivity and objectivity. He joined them and said：
"There is a big stone. Do you consider it to be inside or
outside your mind?"

One of the monks replied： "From the Buddhist viewpoint
everything is an objectification of mind, so I would say that
the stone is inside my mind."

"Your head must feel very heavy," observed Hogen, "if you are
carrying around a stone like that in your mind."
