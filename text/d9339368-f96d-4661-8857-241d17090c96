As in this body the embodied soul passes through childhood, youth and
old age, in the same manner it goes from one body to another;
therefore the wise are never deluded regarding it. ...

As man casts off worn-out garments and puts on others which are new.
similarly the embodied soul, casting off worn-out bodies, enters into
others which are new.
