No life can express, nor tongue so much as name what this enflaming,
all-conquering love of God is. It is brighter than the sun; it is sweeter than
anything that is called sweet; it is stronger than all strength; it is more
nutrimental than food; more cheering to the heart than wine, and more pleasant
than all the joy and pleasantness of this world. Whosoever obtaineth it, is
richer than any monarch on earth; and he who getteth it, is nobler than any
emperor can be, and more potent and absolute than all power and authority.
