He that thinks or holds that outward exercises of religion hurt or are
too low for his degree of spirituality, shows plainly that his
spirituality is only in idea; that it is something that is in him only
as a speculation, or as something that is in his head and not in his
heart.

The truly spiritual man is he that sees God in all things, that sees
all things in God, that receives all things as from Him, that ascribes
all things to Him, that loves and adores Him in and for all things, in
all things absolutely resigned unto Him, doing them for Him from a
principle of pure and perfect love of Him. There is no spiritual
person but this ... and to such a one the outward institutions of
religion are ten times more dear and valuable than to those that are
less spiritual And to think that the spirituality of religion is hurt
by the observance of outward institutions of religion is as absurd as
to think that the inward spirit of charity is hurt by the observance
of outward acts of charity. ...

And I defy any man ... to show that the outward word or outward
prayers and outward psalmody and outward teaching is consistent with a
religion that is too spiritual to admit of outward institutions.
