All that you have uttered,
all that you have heard,
all that you knew,
and all that you have seen,
all of it from the very start
is just the beginning of the fairy tale.

Disappear. This ruin is not your abode.
What matters is the essence of truth ...
When the True Sun shines eternal,
does it matter if here is an atom
or here, its shadow?
