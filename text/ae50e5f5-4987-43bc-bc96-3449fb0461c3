The threads which they (the Fates) spin are so unchangeable, that,
even if they decreed to someone a kingdom which at the moment belonged
to another, and even if that other slew the man of destiny, to save
himself from ever being deprived by him of his throne, nevertheless
the dead man would come to life again in order to fulfil the decree of
the Fates.
