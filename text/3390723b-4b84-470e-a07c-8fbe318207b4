Commentary: This does not invalidate prayers for the dead. It means
  rather that God's decrees are irreversible once consummated.

The Day of Judgement is decisive, and displays unto all the seal of
truth. Even as now a father may not send a son, or a son his father,
or a master his slave, or a friend his dearest, that in his stead he
may be ill, or sleep, or eat, or be healed; so shall none then pray
for another on that Day, neither shall one lay a burden on another;
for then every one shall bear his own righteousness or
unrighteousness. ... So shall no man then be able to have mercy on him
who is condemned in the Judgement, nor overwhelm him who is
victorious.
