Devotee： Is it not selfishness to remain Self-realised without helping
the world?

Maharshi： The Self was pointed out to you to cover the universe and
also transcend it.
The world cannot remain apart from the Self. If the realisation of
such Self be called
selfishness that selfishness must cover the-world also. It is nothing
contemptible.
