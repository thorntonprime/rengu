As long as a man has ... worldly desires, he must perform actions and
consequently suffer from worry, anxiety, and restlessness. No sooner
does he renounce these desires than his activities fall away and he
enjoys peace of soul. ... When love of God is awakened, work drops
away of itself. If God makes some men work, let them work. It is now
time for you to give up everything.
