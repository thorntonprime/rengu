My lowliness raises up God and the lower I humble myself the higher do
I exalt God and the higher I do exalt God the more gently and sweetly
he pours into me his divine gift, his divine influx. For the higher
the inflowing thing the more easy and smooth is its flow.  How God is
raised upon my lowliness I argue thusï¼š the more I abase and keep
myself down the higher God towers above me. The deeper the trough the
higher the crest. In just the same way, the more I abase and humble
myself the higher God goes and the better and easier he pours into me
his divine influx. So it is true that 1 exalt God by my lowliness.
