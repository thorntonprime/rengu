Title: Visiting a Foreign Country
Description: April 10
---
If you were planning to move to a foreign country and thought you
might never return,

would not it then be prudent to acclimate yourself to any custom they
might have

of say ... only drinking one certain liquid and nothing else?

Then, dears, run to the wineshop, run.

For in heaven what can increase your soulâ€™s expanse is all that is
ever served.
