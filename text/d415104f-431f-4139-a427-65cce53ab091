Title: One Outgrows Choice
Description: February 14
---
No one but a rebel can get their mitts on God. And at some point you
will have to wean yourself from the pack. Wish the cares of others
well.

If you really want to do something for those you love, want to leave a
lasting legacy for this world,

you need to climb higher, or reach deeper within and what you then
find, well ...

well, you won’t need to think about what to do with it; free will is
an illusion.

God spoke your every word in His mind before your birth. And one
movement of His hand contained your every act.

There is an Infinite Knowledge that has always existed, and in it
resides everything. And that will someday dawn on you, for you are the
Infinite’s heir.

Real Knowing never makes love to choice, or even considers the
un-predestined an option.

For maybe and choice ... are worlds one outgrows. Still, fire burns;
and who is not careful around it?
