This is a Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto the
God-fearing. ...

Who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that
which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter.

These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.

As for the disbelievers, whether thou warn them or thou warn them not
it is all one for them; they believe not.

Allâh hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes
there is a covering.  Theirs will be an awful doom.
