We find in the prophet Isaiah that the ñre with which each one is punished is
described as his own; for he says. ’Walk ye in the light of your own fire,
and in the flame which ye have kindled' (Is. L 11). By these words it seems
to be indicated that every sinner kindles for himself the flame of his own
fire and is not plunged into some fire already kindled by another. Of this
fire the fuel and food are our sins.
