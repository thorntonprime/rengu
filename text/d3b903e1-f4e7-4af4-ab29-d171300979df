Earthly love is not for the material form but for the beauty manifested upon
it. ... The soul taking that outflow from the Divine is stirred; filled with a
holy ecstasy, stung by desire, it becomes Love. Before that, even Divine Mind
with all Its Loveliness did not stir the soul; for until it takes the light of
the Good the soul lies supine before It, cold, unquickened. But when there
enters into it a glow from the Divine, the soul gathers strength, spreads true
wings, and however distracted by its nearer environing, speeds its buoyant way
to something greater to its memory; so long as there exists anything loftier
than the near, its very nature bears it upwards, lifted by the giver of that
love. Beyond Divine Mind it passes, but beyond the Good it cannot, for nothing
stands above That.
