Let none therefore seek the efficient cause of an evil will; for it is
not efficient but deficient, nor is there effect but defect, namely
falling from that highest essence unto a lower, this is to have an
evil will. The causes whereof (being not efficient but deficient) if
one endeavour to seek, it is as if he should seek to see the darkness,
or to hear silence.
