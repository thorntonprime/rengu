The patient man hath a great and wholesome purgatory, who though he
receive injuries, yet grieveth more for the malice of another, than
for his own suffering; who prayeth willingly for his adversaries, and
from his heart forgiveth their offences. He delayeth not to ask
forgiveness of whomsoever he hath offended; he is sooner moved to
compassion than to anger; he often offereth violence to himself, and
laboreth to bring his body wholly into Suff.  subjection to the
spirit.
