By nature the soul loves nothing but good. The fact is. every man. if he is
really sensible, will find he loves nothing but perfect good, and that is why
God has not given perfect good to any creature. If the soul found perfect
good in creature she would unite with it. ... All creatures are crying aloud
to man, ‘Thou lookest for truth and goodness which we are not： seek God. he
is both truth and goodness." Man is always searching for holiness and
happiness. Satisfaction, perfection, does not belong to creature. One leads
on to another, food to drink and drink to clothes, etc. In all these things
we are allowed to taste the joys of the perfect good in God. St Augustine
says. 'Are ye seeking, then look in God." (God) is the end of creature, or
the soul could never have full satisfaction in God. or peace. In God the soul
will have all perfection at once： if any of it were outside God she would
want to have that as well： she would forget the most for the least and pay
the penalty. St Augustine says.  ‘It is arrant nonsense that the soul is
without him who is everywhere, that she is without him without whom she
cannot be. that she loves not him apart from whom she cannot love at all.'
