But Wonder is it that Wevers deale with such warks.
Free Masons and Tanners with poore Parish Clerks;
Tailors and Glasiers woll not thereof cease.
And eke sely Tinkers will put them in the prease
With greate presumption; but yet some collour there was.
For all such Men as give Tincture to Glasseï¼š
But many Artificers have byn over-swifte
With hasty Credence to fume away their thrifte.
