That prayer has great power which a person makes with all his might.
It makes a sour heart sweet, a sad heart merry, a poor heart rich, a
foolish heart wise, a timid heart brave, a sick heart well, a blind
heart full of sight, a cold heart ardent. It draws down the great God
into the little heart, it drives the hungry soul up into the fullness
of God, it brings together two lovers. God and the soul in a wondrous
place where they speak much of love.
