Therefore, if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable
Mystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man,
but by the grace of God. and that not our will or desire, but only the
mercy of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. ...

When you are in inward harmony with God’s world, outward conformity
will not be wanting. Yet our artist can do nothing but sow, plant, and
water： God must give the increase.
