Thou wast not, and thou wast created. What hast thou given to God?
Thou wast evil.  and thou wast redeemed. What hast thou given to God?
What is there that thou hast not received from Him gratuitously? With
reason it is called ‘grace’ because it is bestowed ‘gratis’. What is
required of thee, therefore, is this, that thou too shouldst worship
Him ‘gratis’; not because He gives things temporal, but because He
offers thee things eternal.
