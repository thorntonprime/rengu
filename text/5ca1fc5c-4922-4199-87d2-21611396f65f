Title: The Shape of Color
Description: December 5
---
The shape of night, the shape of day, the shape of color, the shape of
us. What holds all this?

Who made this miraculous mold and then too, cast everything?

Imagine the form that poured all forms, and then try to conceive the
Being

that whittled out the Holy Spirit from a single thought that took over
the Inconceivable.

What can entwine all this in its arms? What a container there must be
that some, still hung up on names, call ... God.

An atheist would not last long in front of my Beloved, as soon as His
lips touched theirs,

we could have one more religious fanatic to deal with.
