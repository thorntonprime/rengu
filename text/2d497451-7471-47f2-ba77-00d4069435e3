Man, if thou desirest a noble and holy life, and unceasingly prayeth
to God for it, if thou continue constant in this thy desire, it will
be granted unto thee without fail, even if only in the day or hour of
thy death; and if God should not give it thee then, thou shalt find it
in Him in eternityï¼š of this be assured.
