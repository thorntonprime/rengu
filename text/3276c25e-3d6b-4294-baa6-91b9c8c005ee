Title: A Voice through the Door
Description: December 8
---
Sometimes you hear a voice through the door
calling you, as fish out
of water hear the waves, or a hunting falcon
hears the drum's Come back. Come back.

This turning toward what you deeply love
saves you. Read the book of your life,
which has been given you.

A voice comes to your soul saying,
Lift your foot. Cross over.

Move into the emptiness
of question and answer and question.
