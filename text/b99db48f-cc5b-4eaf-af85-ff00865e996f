Just as worldly people glory in their riches, certain aspirants and
s√¢dhus are vain about their moral worth. This kind of pride
constitutes a serious obstacle to spiritual realization; it has to be
completely extirpated. As long as a man is vain, he remains the
minuscule and ordinary incarnation of a soul and cannot know the
divinity.
