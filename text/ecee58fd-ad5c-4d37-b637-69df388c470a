Know that the life of the world is but play1 and diversion and pageantry, and
boasting among you, and rivalry in wealth and children; as the likeness of
vegetation after rain, the growth whereof dumbfounds the sowers;1 then it
drieth up and thou seest it yellowing, then it will be scattered. And in the
Hereafter is grievous punishment, and forgiveness from Allah and His good
pleasure, whereas the life of the world is nought but the stuff of illusion.
