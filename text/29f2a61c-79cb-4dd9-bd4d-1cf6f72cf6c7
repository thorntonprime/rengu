Always flee from whatever you deem profitable to your (lower) self： drink
poison and spill the water of life.

Revile any one that praises you： lend (both) interest and capital to the
destitute.  Let safety go, and dwell in the place of fear： leave reputation
behind and be disgraced and notorious.

I have tried far-thinking (provident) intellect; henceforth I will make
myself mad.
