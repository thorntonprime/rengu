All whatever makes anguish and strife in nature, that makes mere joy in God：
for the whole host of heaven is set and tuned into one harmony： each
angelical kingdom into a peculiar instrument, but all mutually composed
together into one music, viz.  into the only love-voice of God： Every string
of this melody exalts and rejoices the other.
