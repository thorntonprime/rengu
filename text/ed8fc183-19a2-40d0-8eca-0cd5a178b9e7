Under the sway of strong impulse the man who is devoid of self-control
wilfully commits deeds that he knows to be fraught with future misery. But
the man of discrimination, even though moved by desires, at once becomes
conscious of the evil that is in them, and does not yield to their influence
but remains unattached.
