  - Life-Love=Faith=Fidelity
By: Sri Ramakrishna
Commentary: One must not mistakenly conclude that faith is subjective. What
  it does is 'activate' the spiritual influences attaching to a certain
  symbol or rite.

If a man is initiated by a human guru, he will not achieve anything if
he regards his guru as a mere man. The guru should be regarded as the
direct manifestation of God. Only then can the disciple have faith in
the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he achieves all.
The sudra Ekalavya learnt archery in the forest before a clay image of
Drona.  He worshipped the image as the living Drona; that by itself
enabled him to attain mastery in archery.
