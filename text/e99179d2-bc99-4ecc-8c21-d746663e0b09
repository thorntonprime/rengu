I remember one time when I ‘lamented’, and a great storm came from the
place where the sun goes down, and I talked with the Thunder-beings
who came with hail and thunder and lightning and much rain, and the
next morning I saw that there was hail all piled up on the ground
around the sacred place, yet inside it was perfectly dry. I think that
they were trying to test me. And then, on one of the nights the bad
spirits came and started tearing the offerings off the poles： and I
heard their voices under the ground, and one of them said： ‘Go and
see if he is crying." And I heard rattles, but all the time they were
outside the sacred place and could not get in. for I had resolved not
to be afraid, and did not stop sending my voice to Wakan-Tanka for
aid.
