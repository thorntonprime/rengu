God cannot be seen with these physical eyes. In the course of spiritual
discipline one gets a ‘love body', endowed with ‘love eyes', ‘love ears’, and
so on. One sees God with those ‘love eyes’. One hears the voice of God with
those ‘love ears'. One even gets a sexual organ made of love. ... With this
‘love body' the soul communes with God.
