A man is the creator of his own fate, and even in his foetal life he
is affected by the dynamics of the works of his prior existence. ...

This human body entombs a self which is nothing if not emphatically a
worker. It is the works of this self in a prior existence which
determine the nature of its organism in the next. ... What is lotted
cannot be blotted. A frightened mouse runs to its hole; a scared
serpent, to a well; a terrified elephant, to its stake -- but where
can a man fly from his Karma?
