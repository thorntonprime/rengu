Title: What King of Courage Is Required of Us?
Description: May 31

What kind of courage is required of us?

Imagine a person taken out of his room, and without preparation or transition
placed on the heights of a great mountain range. He would feel an unparalleled
insecurity, an almost annihilating abandonment to the nameless. He would feel
he was falling into outer space or shattering into a thousand pieces. What
enormous lie would his brain concoct in order to give meaning to this and
validate his senses? In such a way do all measures and distances change for the
one who realizes his solitude. These changes are often sudden and, as with the
person on the mountain peak, bring strange feelings and fantasies that are
almost unbearable. But it is necessary for us to experience that too. We must
accept our reality in all its immensity. Everything, even the unheard of, must
be possible within it. This is, in the end, the only kind of courage that is
required of us： the courage to meet the strangest, most awesome, and most
inexplicable of phenomena.
