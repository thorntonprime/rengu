\'If it were just a matter of playing football with the firmament,
stirring up the ocean, turning back rivers, carrying away mountains,
seizing the moon, moving the Pole-star or shifting a planet, I could
manage it easily enough. Even if it were a question of my head being
cut off and the brain removed or my belly being ripped open and my
heart cut out, or any kind of transference or transformation, I would
take on the job at once,’ said Monkey.  ‘But if it comes to sitting
still and meditating, I am bound to come off badly. It’s quite against
my nature to sit still.'
