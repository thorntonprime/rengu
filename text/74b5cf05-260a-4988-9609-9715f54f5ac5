Plato saith, That three sorts of Persons are led to God, The Musician by
Harmony, the Philosopher by the beam of Truth, the Lover by the light of
Beauty. All these Conductors to the supream Being meet in this Love, of which
we speak; the first and only true Beauty, being the first Birth, the first
Effulgency, the essential Image of the supream Goodness, is also the first, the
supream, the only Truth; the Original, the measure, the end of all Truth; which
by its amiable attractive Light, conducteth all Understandings in the search of
Truth, and giveth them rest only in its transparent and blissful Bosom. This
also is the first, the only, the universal Harmony, the Musick of all things in
Heaven and on Earthï¼š the Musick, in which all things of Earth and of Heaven,
meet to make one melodious Consort.
