Title: I Have Come into This WOrld to See This II
Description: November 23

every song of stream and rock, every song of tool and lyre and flute,
every song of gold and emerald and fire,

every song the heart should cry with magnificent dignity to know
itself as God;

for all other knowledge will leave us again in want and aching—only
imbibing the glorious Sun will complete us.

I have come into this world to experience this： women and men so true
to love they would rather die before speaking an unkind word,

women and men so true their lives are His covenant -- the promise of
hope.

I have come into this world to see this：

the sword drop from men’s hands even at the height of their arc of
rage

because we have finally realized, we have finally realized, there is
just one flesh we can wound and it is our own.
