If thou desire (spiritual) poverty, that depends on companionship
(with a Shaykh)： neither thy tongue nor thy hand avails.

Soul receives from soul the knowledge thereof, not by way of book nor
from tongue.

(Even) if those mysteries (of spiritual poverty) are in the
traveller’s heart, knowledge of the mystery is not yet possessed by
the traveller.
