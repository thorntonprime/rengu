TItle: More Inheritance
---
Love creates a synchronicity with what love
loves.

Why wouldn't it do that, knowing harmony's
vital role.

The calm heart's reach is vast and lasting.
Bring yourself, again, into the presence of

somone who knows God, for more inheritance
is there for you.

Hold hands with the Buddha, if a living saint's
warmth has been forgotten.

Like a special day when you can naturally feel
uplifted by something in the air, should be a

truth ... we always carry.
