God is marvellous in His works, and He is not mocked. 1 could give
some instances of men who set about this matter with great levity and
were heavily punished by meeting (some of them) with fatal accidents
in their laboratories. For this work is no light thing, as many
suppose, perhaps, because the Sages have called it childâ€™s play.
Those to whom God has revealed His secrets may indeed find the
experiment simple and easy. But do thou carefully beware of exposing
thyself to great danger by unseasonable carelessness. Rather begin thy
work with reverent fear and awe and with earnest prayer, and then thou
wilt be in little danger.
