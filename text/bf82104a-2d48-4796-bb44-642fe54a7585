Description: December 23

It is the Beloved who is revealed in every face, sought in every sign,

gazed upon by every eye, worshipped in every object that is adored,
pursued in the visible and in the unseen.

Not a single one of His creatures, not a single one, my dears, will

fail to someday find the divine Source in all of its primordial and
glorious nature.

And be forever united with the Infinite, because that -- God -- is
really you.

Muhyiddin Ibn â€™Arabi, look what your words have become -- the
restoration of Truth, the regeneration of Life itself.
