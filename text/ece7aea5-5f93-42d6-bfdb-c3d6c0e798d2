Sanyâsa is to renounce one’s individuality. This is not the same as tonsure
and ochre robes. A man may be a grhi (householder); yet if he does not think
he is a grhi, he is a sanyâsi. On the contrary a man may wear ochre robes and
wander about; yet if he thinks he is a sanyâsi he is not that. To think of
sanyâsa defeats its own purpose. ...

It consists in renunciation not of material objects but of attachment to
them.
