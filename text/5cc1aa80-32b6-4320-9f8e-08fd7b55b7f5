Title: When a Dog Runs Up
---
Start seeing everything as God, but keep
it a secret.

Become like the man and the woman who are
awestruck and nourished

listening to a golden nightingale sing
in a beautiful foreign language while God,
invisible to most, nests upon its tongue.

Hafiz, who can you tell in this world that
when a dog runs up to you wagging its
ecstatic tail, you lean over and whisper in
its ear,

"Beloved, I am so glad you are happy to
see me! Beloved, I am so glad, so very glad
you have come!"
