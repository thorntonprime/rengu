The soul is taken by God to a secret place where it must not ask nor pray for
anyone, for God alone will play with it in a game of which the body knows
nothing, any more than the peasant at the plough or the knight in the tourney;
not even His loving mother Mary; she can do nothing here. Thus God and the soul
soar further to a blissful place of which I neither can nor will say much. It is
too great and I dare not speak of it for I am a sinful creature.
