  It is reported in a biography of Ananda Moyi that she herself is capable
  of both prodigious eating and prodigious fasting. Cf. also the remarkable
  tour de force of Abu Sa‘id ibn Abi 'l-Khayr. recounted in Nicholson's Studies
  in Islamic Mysticism, pp. 7 1 - 72.

Much has been discussed about the necessity of pure nourishment in order to
have spiritual development. For me, true nourishment means the assimilation
of pure thoughts, and devotion to the Truth or God. In vain you may take the
most perfectly sâttvic meals each day; what nourishment will your soul derive
from this mass of pure food if your mind remains constantly absorbed in
material thoughts? ... Everything that the senses receive is nourishment. Be
careful therefore not to let yourself be encroached upon by your stomach.
And try always to remain the master of what you absorb.
