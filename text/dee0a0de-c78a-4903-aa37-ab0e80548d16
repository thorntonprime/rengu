Had there been any evil in all fallen nature, whether in life, death,
or hell, that had not attacked Him (Christ) with all its force. He
could not have been said to have overcome it.  And therefore so sure
as Christ as the Son of man was to overcome the world, death, hell and
Satan, so sure is it that all the evils which they could possibly
bring upon Him were to be felt and suffered by Him as absolutely
necessary in the nature of the thing to declare His perfection and
prove His superiority over them.
