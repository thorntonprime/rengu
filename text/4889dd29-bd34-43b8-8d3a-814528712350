God and the Guru are not really different： they are identical. He that
has earned the Grace of the Guru shall undoubtedly be saved and never
forsaken, just as the prey that has fallen into the tiger’s jaws will
never be allowed to escape. But the disciple, for his part, should
unswervingly follow the path shown by the Master.
