Title: You WIll Have to Factor Me In
Description: February 23
---
Another’s sounds should be careful in soliciting my attention and then
my response, unless the

crystal, the Looking Glass, they too wish to enter.

The way a river’s strength may move one in its current, so does my
gaze or wish.

What the rain can do for a well, so can the language from an illumined
heart.

When I woke up I found existence rented its space from me.

I am the wedding partner, every ring, and the priest who blesses the
union.

I am the tenderness that becomes a sacred oath,

thus even when you close the door and might want privacy,

what can I say? You will still have to factor me in.
