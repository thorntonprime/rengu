When they (worldly people) need water they begin to dig a well. But as
soon as they strike a stone they give up digging there and begin at
another place. Perhaps they come to a bed of sand. Finding nothing but
sand, they give that place up too. How can they succeed in getting
water unless they continue to dig persistently where they started?
