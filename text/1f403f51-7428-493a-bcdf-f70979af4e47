Hail, O cross, yea be glad indeed! ... I come unto thee that hast
yearned after me. I know thy mystery, for the which thou art set up：
for thou art planted in the world to establish the things that are
unstable： and the one part of thee stretcheth up toward heaven that
thou mayest signify the heavenly word (the head of all things)： and
another part of thee is spread out to the right hand and the left that
it may put to flight the envious and adverse power of the evil one,
and gather into one the things that are scattered abroad： And another
part of thee is planted in the earth, and securely set in the depth,
that thou mayest join the things that are in the earth and that are
under the earth unto the heavenly things. ...

Well done, O cross, that hast bound down the mobility of the world!
Well done, O shape of understanding that hast shaped the shapeless!
