Foreword

   IN PREPARING this edition of The Imitation of Christ, the aim was to
   achieve a simple, readable text which would ring true to those who are
   already lovers of this incomparable book and would attract others to
   it. For this reason we have attempted to render the text into English
   as it is spoken today rather than the cloudy, archaic terminology that
   encumbers so many translations of Christian classics. The result, we
   feel, has achieved a directness and conciseness which will meet the
   approval of modern readers. In the second place, we have made use of
   the familiar paragraph form, doing away with the simple statement or
   verse form of the original and of many translations. This was done in
   the interest of easier reading, and in order to bring out more clearly
   the connection between the single statements.

   No claim of literary excellence over the many English versions now
   extant is here advanced, nor any attempt to solve in further confusion
   the problem of the book's authorship.

   Theories most popular at the moment ascribe the Imitation to two or
   three men, members of the Brethren of the Common Life, an association
   of priests organized in the Netherlands in the latter half of the
   fourteenth century. That Thomas Hemerken of Kempen, or Thomas à Kempis
   as he is now known, later translated a composite of their writings,
   essentially a spiritual diary, from the original Netherlandish into
   Latin is generally admitted by scholars. This Thomas, born about the
   year 1380, was educated by the Brethren of the Common Life, was moved
   to join their community, and was ordained priest. His career thereafter
   was devoted to practicing the counsels of spiritual perfection and to
   copying books for the schools. From both pursuits evolved The Imitation
   of Christ. As editor and translator he was not without faults, but
   thanks to him the Imitation became and has remained, after the Bible,
   the most widely read book in the world. It is his edition that is here
   rendered into English, without deletion of chapters or parts of them
   because doubts exist as to their authorship, or because of variants in
   style, or for any of the other more or less valid reasons.

   There is but one major change. The treatise on Holy Communion, which à
   Kempis places as Book Three, is here titled Book Four. The move makes
   the order of the whole more logical and agrees with the thought of most
   editors.

THOUGHTS HELPFUL

IN THE LIFE OF THE SOUL


     __________________________________________________________________

    The First Chapter

  Imitating Christ and Despising All Vanities on Earth

   HE WHO follows Me, walks not in darkness," says the Lord (John 8:12).
   By these words of Christ we are advised to imitate His life and habits,
   if we wish to be truly enlightened and free from all blindness of
   heart. Let our chief effort, therefore, be to study the life of Jesus
   Christ.

   The teaching of Christ is more excellent than all the advice of the
   saints, and he who has His spirit will find in it a hidden manna. Now,
   there are many who hear the Gospel often but care little for it because
   they have not the spirit of Christ. Yet whoever wishes to understand
   fully the words of Christ must try to pattern his whole life on that of
   Christ.

   What good does it do to speak learnedly about the Trinity if, lacking
   humility, you displease the Trinity? Indeed it is not learning that
   makes a man holy and just, but a virtuous life makes him pleasing to
   God. I would rather feel contrition than know how to define it. For
   what would it profit us to know the whole Bible by heart and the
   principles of all the philosophers if we live without grace and the
   love of God? Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God
   and serve Him alone.

   This is the greatest wisdom--to seek the kingdom of heaven through
   contempt of the world. It is vanity, therefore, to seek and trust in
   riches that perish. It is vanity also to court honor and to be puffed
   up with pride. It is vanity to follow the lusts of the body and to
   desire things for which severe punishment later must come. It is vanity
   to wish for long life and to care little about a well-spent life. It is
   vanity to be concerned with the present only and not to make provision
   for things to come. It is vanity to love what passes quickly and not to
   look ahead where eternal joy abides.

   Often recall the proverb: "The eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the
   ear filled with hearing." [1] Try, moreover, to turn your heart from
   the love of things visible and bring yourself to things invisible. For
   they who follow their own evil passions stain their consciences and
   lose the grace of God.

    The Second Chapter

  Having a Humble Opinion of Self

   EVERY man naturally desires knowledge [2] ; but what good is knowledge
   without fear of God? Indeed a humble rustic who serves God is better
   than a proud intellectual who neglects his soul to study the course of
   the stars. [3] He who knows himself well becomes mean in his own eyes
   and is not happy when praised by men.

   If I knew all things in the world and had not charity, what would it
   profit me before God Who will judge me by my deeds?

   Shun too great a desire for knowledge, for in it there is much fretting
   and delusion. Intellectuals like to appear learned and to be called
   wise. Yet there are many things the knowledge of which does little or
   no good to the soul, and he who concerns himself about other things
   than those which lead to salvation is very unwise.

   Many words do not satisfy the soul; but a good life eases the mind and
   a clean conscience inspires great trust in God.

   The more you know and the better you understand, the more severely will
   you be judged, unless your life is also the more holy. Do not be proud,
   therefore, because of your learning or skill. Rather, fear because of
   the talent given you. If you think you know many things and understand
   them well enough, realize at the same time that there is much you do
   not know. Hence, do not affect wisdom, but admit your ignorance. Why
   prefer yourself to anyone else when many are more learned, more
   cultured than you?

   If you wish to learn and appreciate something worth while, then love to
   be unknown and considered as nothing. Truly to know and despise self is
   the best and most perfect counsel. To think of oneself as nothing, and
   always to think well and highly of others is the best and most perfect
   wisdom. Wherefore, if you see another sin openly or commit a serious
   crime, do not consider yourself better, for you do not know how long
   you can remain in good estate. All men are frail, but you must admit
   that none is more frail than yourself.

    The Third Chapter

  The Doctrine of Truth

   HAPPY is he to whom truth manifests itself, not in signs and words that
   fade, but as it actually is. Our opinions, our senses often deceive us
   and we discern very little.

   What good is much discussion of involved and obscure matters when our
   ignorance of them will not be held against us on Judgment Day? Neglect
   of things which are profitable and necessary and undue concern with
   those which are irrelevant and harmful, are great folly.

   We have eyes and do not see.

   What, therefore, have we to do with questions of philosophy? He to whom
   the Eternal Word speaks is free from theorizing. For from this Word are
   all things and of Him all things speak--the Beginning Who also speaks
   to us. Without this Word no man understands or judges aright. He to
   whom it becomes everything, who traces all things to it and who sees
   all things in it, may ease his heart and remain at peace with God.

   O God, You Who are the truth, make me one with You in love everlasting.
   I am often wearied by the many things I hear and read, but in You is
   all that I long for. Let the learned be still, let all creatures be
   silent before You; You alone speak to me.

   The more recollected a man is, and the more simple of heart he becomes,
   the easier he understands sublime things, for he receives the light of
   knowledge from above. The pure, simple, and steadfast spirit is not
   distracted by many labors, for he does them all for the honor of God.
   And since he enjoys interior peace he seeks no selfish end in anything.
   What, indeed, gives more trouble and affliction than uncontrolled
   desires of the heart?

   A good and devout man arranges in his mind the things he has to do, not
   according to the whims of evil inclination but according to the
   dictates of right reason. Who is forced to struggle more than he who
   tries to master himself? This ought to be our purpose, then: to conquer
   self, to become stronger each day, to advance in virtue.

   Every perfection in this life has some imperfection mixed with it and
   no learning of ours is without some darkness. Humble knowledge of self
   is a surer path to God than the ardent pursuit of learning. Not that
   learning is to be considered evil, or knowledge, which is good in
   itself and so ordained by God; but a clean conscience and virtuous life
   ought always to be preferred. Many often err and accomplish little or
   nothing because they try to become learned rather than to live well.

   If men used as much care in uprooting vices and implanting virtues as
   they do in discussing problems, there would not be so much evil and
   scandal in the world, or such laxity in religious organizations. On the
   day of judgment, surely, we shall not be asked what we have read but
   what we have done; not how well we have spoken but how well we have
   lived.

   Tell me, where now are all the masters and teachers whom you knew so
   well in life and who were famous for their learning? Others have
   already taken their places and I know not whether they ever think of
   their predecessors. During life they seemed to be something; now they
   are seldom remembered. How quickly the glory of the world passes away!
   If only their lives had kept pace with their learning, then their study
   and reading would have been worth while.

   How many there are who perish because of vain worldly knowledge and too
   little care for serving God. They became vain in their own conceits
   because they chose to be great rather than humble.

   He is truly great who has great charity. He is truly great who is
   little in his own eyes and makes nothing of the highest honor. He is
   truly wise who looks upon all earthly things as folly that he may gain
   Christ. He who does God's will and renounces his own is truly very
   learned.

    The Fourth Chapter

  Prudence in Action

   DO NOT yield to every impulse and suggestion but consider things
   carefully and patiently in the light of God's will. For very often, sad
   to say, we are so weak that we believe and speak evil of others rather
   than good. Perfect men, however, do not readily believe every
   talebearer, because they know that human frailty is prone to evil and
   is likely to appear in speech.

   Not to act rashly or to cling obstinately to one's opinion, not to
   believe everything people say or to spread abroad the gossip one has
   heard, is great wisdom.

   Take counsel with a wise and conscientious man. Seek the advice of your
   betters in preference to following your own inclinations.

   A good life makes a man wise according to God and gives him experience
   in many things, for the more humble he is and the more subject to God,
   the wiser and the more at peace he will be in all things.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifth Chapter

  Reading the Holy Scripture

   TRUTH, not eloquence, is to be sought in reading the Holy Scriptures;
   and every part must be read in the spirit in which it was written. For
   in the Scriptures we ought to seek profit rather than polished diction.

   Likewise we ought to read simple and devout books as willingly as
   learned and profound ones. We ought not to be swayed by the authority
   of the writer, whether he be a great literary light or an insignificant
   person, but by the love of simple truth. We ought not to ask who is
   speaking, but mark what is said. Men pass away, but the truth of the
   Lord remains forever. God speaks to us in many ways without regard for
   persons.

   Our curiosity often impedes our reading of the Scriptures, when we wish
   to understand and mull over what we ought simply to read and pass by.

   If you would profit from it, therefore, read with humility, simplicity,
   and faith, and never seek a reputation for being learned. Seek
   willingly and listen attentively to the words of the saints; do not be
   displeased with the sayings of the ancients, for they were not made
   without purpose.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Sixth Chapter

  Unbridled Affections

   WHEN a man desires a thing too much, he at once becomes ill at ease. A
   proud and avaricious man never rests, whereas he who is poor and humble
   of heart lives in a world of peace. An unmortified man is quickly
   tempted and overcome in small, trifling evils; his spirit is weak, in a
   measure carnal and inclined to sensual things; he can hardly abstain
   from earthly desires. Hence it makes him sad to forego them; he is
   quick to anger if reproved. Yet if he satisfies his desires, remorse of
   conscience overwhelms him because he followed his passions and they did
   not lead to the peace he sought.

   True peace of heart, then, is found in resisting passions, not in
   satisfying them. There is no peace in the carnal man, in the man given
   to vain attractions, but there is peace in the fervent and spiritual
   man.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Seventh Chapter

  Avoiding False Hope and Pride

   VAIN is the man who puts his trust in men, in created things.

   Do not be ashamed to serve others for the love of Jesus Christ and to
   seem poor in this world. Do not be self-sufficient but place your trust
   in God. Do what lies in your power and God will aid your good will. Put
   no trust in your own learning nor in the cunning of any man, but rather
   in the grace of God Who helps the humble and humbles the proud.

   If you have wealth, do not glory in it, nor in friends because they are
   powerful, but in God Who gives all things and Who desires above all to
   give Himself. Do not boast of personal stature or of physical beauty,
   qualities which are marred and destroyed by a little sickness. Do not
   take pride in your talent or ability, lest you displease God to Whom
   belongs all the natural gifts that you have.

   Do not think yourself better than others lest, perhaps, you be
   accounted worse before God Who knows what is in man. Do not take pride
   in your good deeds, for God's judgments differ from those of men and
   what pleases them often displeases Him. If there is good in you, see
   more good in others, so that you may remain humble. It does no harm to
   esteem yourself less than anyone else, but it is very harmful to think
   yourself better than even one. The humble live in continuous peace,
   while in the hearts of the proud are envy and frequent anger.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Eighth Chapter

  Shunning Over-Familiarity

   DO NOT open your heart to every man, but discuss your affairs with one
   who is wise and who fears God. Do not keep company with young people
   and strangers. Do not fawn upon the rich, and do not be fond of
   mingling with the great. Associate with the humble and the simple, with
   the devout and virtuous, and with them speak of edifying things. Be not
   intimate with any woman, but generally commend all good women to God.
   Seek only the intimacy of God and of His angels, and avoid the notice
   of men.

   We ought to have charity for all men but familiarity with all is not
   expedient. Sometimes it happens that a person enjoys a good reputation
   among those who do not know him, but at the same time is held in slight
   regard by those who do. Frequently we think we are pleasing others by
   our presence and we begin rather to displease them by the faults they
   find in us.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Ninth Chapter

  Obedience and Subjection

   IT IS a very great thing to obey, to live under a superior and not to
   be one's own master, for it is much safer to be subject than it is to
   command. Many live in obedience more from necessity than from love.
   Such become discontented and dejected on the slightest pretext; they
   will never gain peace of mind unless they subject themselves
   wholeheartedly for the love of God.

   Go where you may, you will find no rest except in humble obedience to
   the rule of authority. Dreams of happiness expected from change and
   different places have deceived many.

   Everyone, it is true, wishes to do as he pleases and is attracted to
   those who agree with him. But if God be among us, we must at times give
   up our opinions for the blessings of peace.

   Furthermore, who is so wise that he can have full knowledge of
   everything? Do not trust too much in your own opinions, but be willing
   to listen to those of others. If, though your own be good, you accept
   another's opinion for love of God, you will gain much more merit; for I
   have often heard that it is safer to listen to advice and take it than
   to give it. It may happen, too, that while one's own opinion may be
   good, refusal to agree with others when reason and occasion demand it,
   is a sign of pride and obstinacy.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Tenth Chapter

  Avoiding Idle Talk

   SHUN the gossip of men as much as possible, for discussion of worldly
   affairs, even though sincere, is a great distraction inasmuch as we are
   quickly ensnared and captivated by vanity.

   Many a time I wish that I had held my peace and had not associated with
   men. Why, indeed, do we converse and gossip among ourselves when we so
   seldom part without a troubled conscience? We do so because we seek
   comfort from one another's conversation and wish to ease the mind
   wearied by diverse thoughts. Hence, we talk and think quite fondly of
   things we like very much or of things we dislike intensely. But, sad to
   say, we often talk vainly and to no purpose; for this external pleasure
   effectively bars inward and divine consolation.

   Therefore we must watch and pray lest time pass idly.

   When the right and opportune moment comes for speaking, say something
   that will edify.

   Bad habits and indifference to spiritual progress do much to remove the
   guard from the tongue. Devout conversation on spiritual matters, on the
   contrary, is a great aid to spiritual progress, especially when persons
   of the same mind and spirit associate together in God.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Eleventh Chapter

  Acquiring Peace and Zeal for Perfection

   WE SHOULD enjoy much peace if we did not concern ourselves with what
   others say and do, for these are no concern of ours. How can a man who
   meddles in affairs not his own, who seeks strange distractions, and who
   is little or seldom inwardly recollected, live long in peace?

   Blessed are the simple of heart for they shall enjoy peace in
   abundance.

   Why were some of the saints so perfect and so given to contemplation?
   Because they tried to mortify entirely in themselves all earthly
   desires, and thus they were able to attach themselves to God with all
   their heart and freely to concentrate their innermost thoughts.

   We are too occupied with our own whims and fancies, too taken up with
   passing things. Rarely do we completely conquer even one vice, and we
   are not inflamed with the desire to improve ourselves day by day;
   hence, we remain cold and indifferent. If we mortified our bodies
   perfectly and allowed no distractions to enter our minds, we could
   appreciate divine things and experience something of heavenly
   contemplation.

   The greatest obstacle, indeed, the only obstacle, is that we are not
   free from passions and lusts, that we do not try to follow the perfect
   way of the saints. Thus when we encounter some slight difficulty, we
   are too easily dejected and turn to human consolations. If we tried,
   however, to stand as brave men in battle, the help of the Lord from
   heaven would surely sustain us. For He Who gives us the opportunity of
   fighting for victory, is ready to help those who carry on and trust in
   His grace.

   If we let our progress in religious life depend on the observance of
   its externals alone, our devotion will quickly come to an end. Let us,
   then, lay the axe to the root that we may be freed from our passions
   and thus have peace of mind.

   If we were to uproot only one vice each year, we should soon become
   perfect. The contrary, however, is often the case--we feel that we were
   better and purer in the first fervor of our conversion than we are
   after many years in the practice of our faith. Our fervor and progress
   ought to increase day by day; yet it is now considered noteworthy if a
   man can retain even a part of his first fervor.

   If we did a little violence to ourselves at the start, we should
   afterwards be able to do all things with ease and joy. It is hard to
   break old habits, but harder still to go against our will.

   If you do not overcome small, trifling things, how will you overcome
   the more difficult? Resist temptations in the beginning, and unlearn
   the evil habit lest perhaps, little by little, it lead to a more evil
   one.

   If you but consider what peace a good life will bring to yourself and
   what joy it will give to others, I think you will be more concerned
   about your spiritual progress.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twelfth Chapter

  The Value of Adversity

   IT IS good for us to have trials and troubles at times, for they often
   remind us that we are on probation and ought not to hope in any worldly
   thing. It is good for us sometimes to suffer contradiction, to be
   misjudged by men even though we do well and mean well. These things
   help us to be humble and shield us from vainglory. When to all outward
   appearances men give us no credit, when they do not think well of us,
   then we are more inclined to seek God Who sees our hearts. Therefore, a
   man ought to root himself so firmly in God that he will not need the
   consolations of men.

   When a man of good will is afflicted, tempted, and tormented by evil
   thoughts, he realizes clearly that his greatest need is God, without
   Whom he can do no good. Saddened by his miseries and sufferings, he
   laments and prays. He wearies of living longer and wishes for death
   that he might be dissolved and be with Christ. Then he understands
   fully that perfect security and complete peace cannot be found on
   earth.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirteenth Chapter

  Resisting Temptation

   SO LONG as we live in this world we cannot escape suffering and
   temptation. Whence it is written in Job: "The life of man upon earth is
   a warfare." [4] Everyone, therefore, must guard against temptation and
   must watch in prayer lest the devil, who never sleeps but goes about
   seeking whom he may devour, find occasion to deceive him. No one is so
   perfect or so holy but he is sometimes tempted; man cannot be
   altogether free from temptation.

   Yet temptations, though troublesome and severe, are often useful to a
   man, for in them he is humbled, purified, and instructed. The saints
   all passed through many temptations and trials to profit by them, while
   those who could not resist became reprobate and fell away. There is no
   state so holy, no place so secret that temptations and trials will not
   come. Man is never safe from them as long as he lives, for they come
   from within us--in sin we were born. When one temptation or trial
   passes, another comes; we shall always have something to suffer because
   we have lost the state of original blessedness.

   Many people try to escape temptations, only to fall more deeply. We
   cannot conquer simply by fleeing, but by patience and true humility we
   become stronger than all our enemies. The man who only shuns
   temptations outwardly and does not uproot them will make little
   progress; indeed they will quickly return, more violent than before.

   Little by little, in patience and long-suffering you will overcome
   them, by the help of God rather than by severity and your own rash
   ways. Often take counsel when tempted; and do not be harsh with others
   who are tempted, but console them as you yourself would wish to be
   consoled.

   The beginning of all temptation lies in a wavering mind and little
   trust in God, for as a rudderless ship is driven hither and yon by
   waves, so a careless and irresolute man is tempted in many ways. Fire
   tempers iron and temptation steels the just. Often we do not know what
   we can stand, but temptation shows us what we are.

   Above all, we must be especially alert against the beginnings of
   temptation, for the enemy is more easily conquered if he is refused
   admittance to the mind and is met beyond the threshold when he knocks.

   Someone has said very aptly: "Resist the beginnings; remedies come too
   late, when by long delay the evil has gained strength." First, a mere
   thought comes to mind, then strong imagination, followed by pleasure,
   evil delight, and consent. Thus, because he is not resisted in the
   beginning, Satan gains full entry. And the longer a man delays in
   resisting, so much the weaker does he become each day, while the
   strength of the enemy grows against him.

   Some suffer great temptations in the beginning of their conversion,
   others toward the end, while some are troubled almost constantly
   throughout their life. Others, again, are tempted but lightly according
   to the wisdom and justice of Divine Providence Who weighs the status
   and merit of each and prepares all for the salvation of His elect.

   We should not despair, therefore, when we are tempted, but pray to God
   the more fervently that He may see fit to help us, for according to the
   word of Paul, He will make issue with temptation that we may be able to
   bear it. Let us humble our souls under the hand of God in every trial
   and temptation for He will save and exalt the humble in spirit.

   In temptations and trials the progress of a man is measured; in them
   opportunity for merit and virtue is made more manifest.

   When a man is not troubled it is not hard for him to be fervent and
   devout, but if he bears up patiently in time of adversity, there is
   hope for great progress.

   Some, guarded against great temptations, are frequently overcome by
   small ones in order that, humbled by their weakness in small trials,
   they may not presume on their own strength in great ones.

    The Fourteenth Chapter

  Avoiding Rash Judgment

   TURN your attention upon yourself and beware of judging the deeds of
   other men, for in judging others a man labors vainly, often makes
   mistakes, and easily sins; whereas, in judging and taking stock of
   himself he does something that is always profitable.

   We frequently judge that things are as we wish them to be, for through
   personal feeling true perspective is easily lost.

   If God were the sole object of our desire, we should not be disturbed
   so easily by opposition to our opinions. But often something lurks
   within or happens from without to draw us along with it.

   Many, unawares, seek themselves in the things they do. They seem even
   to enjoy peace of mind when things happen according to their wish and
   liking, but if otherwise than they desire, they are soon disturbed and
   saddened. Differences of feeling and opinion often divide friends and
   acquaintances, even those who are religious and devout.

   An old habit is hard to break, and no one is willing to be led farther
   than he can see.

   If you rely more upon your intelligence or industry than upon the
   virtue of submission to Jesus Christ, you will hardly, and in any case
   slowly, become an enlightened man. God wants us to be completely
   subject to Him and, through ardent love, to rise above all human
   wisdom.

   NEVER do evil for anything in the world, or for the love of any man.
   For one who is in need, however, a good work may at times be purposely
   left undone or changed for a better one. This is not the omission of a
   good deed but rather its improvement.

   Without charity external work is of no value, but anything done in
   charity, be it ever so small and trivial, is entirely fruitful inasmuch
   as God weighs the love with which a man acts rather than the deed
   itself.

   He does much who loves much. He does much who does a thing well. He
   does well who serves the common good rather than his own interests.

   Now, that which seems to be charity is oftentimes really sensuality,
   for man's own inclination, his own will, his hope of reward, and his
   self-interest, are motives seldom absent. On the contrary, he who has
   true and perfect charity seeks self in nothing, but searches all things
   for the glory of God. Moreover, he envies no man, because he desires no
   personal pleasure nor does he wish to rejoice in himself; rather he
   desires the greater glory of God above all things. He ascribes to man
   nothing that is good but attributes it wholly to God from Whom all
   things proceed as from a fountain, and in Whom all the blessed shall
   rest as their last end and fruition.

   If man had but a spark of true charity he would surely sense that all
   the things of earth are full of vanity!

    The Sixteenth Chapter

  Bearing with the Faults of Others

   UNTIL God ordains otherwise, a man ought to bear patiently whatever he
   cannot correct in himself and in others. Consider it better
   thus--perhaps to try your patience and to test you, for without such
   patience and trial your merits are of little account. Nevertheless,
   under such difficulties you should pray that God will consent to help
   you bear them calmly.

   If, after being admonished once or twice, a person does not amend, do
   not argue with him but commit the whole matter to God that His will and
   honor may be furthered in all His servants, for God knows well how to
   turn evil to good. Try to bear patiently with the defects and
   infirmities of others, whatever they may be, because you also have many
   a fault which others must endure.

   If you cannot make yourself what you would wish to be, how can you bend
   others to your will? We want them to be perfect, yet we do not correct
   our own faults. We wish them to be severely corrected, yet we will not
   correct ourselves. Their great liberty displeases us, yet we would not
   be denied what we ask. We would have them bound by laws, yet we will
   allow ourselves to be restrained in nothing. Hence, it is clear how
   seldom we think of others as we do of ourselves.

   If all were perfect, what should we have to suffer from others for
   God's sake? But God has so ordained, that we may learn to bear with one
   another's burdens, for there is no man without fault, no man without
   burden, no man sufficient to himself nor wise enough. Hence we must
   support one another, console one another, mutually help, counsel, and
   advise, for the measure of every man's virtue is best revealed in time
   of adversity--adversity that does not weaken a man but rather shows
   what he is.

    The Seventeenth Chapter

  Monastic Life

   IF YOU wish peace and concord with others, you must learn to break your
   will in many things. To live in monasteries or religious communities,
   to remain there without complaint, and to persevere faithfully till
   death is no small matter. Blessed indeed is he who there lives a good
   life and there ends his days in happiness.

   If you would persevere in seeking perfection, you must consider
   yourself a pilgrim, an exile on earth. If you would become a religious,
   you must be content to seem a fool for the sake of Christ. Habit and
   tonsure change a man but little; it is the change of life, the complete
   mortification of passions that endow a true religious.

   He who seeks anything but God alone and the salvation of his soul will
   find only trouble and grief, and he who does not try to become the
   least, the servant of all, cannot remain at peace for long.

   You have come to serve, not to rule. You must understand, too, that you
   have been called to suffer and to work, not to idle and gossip away
   your time. Here men are tried as gold in a furnace. Here no man can
   remain unless he desires with all his heart to humble himself before
   God.

    The Eighteenth Chapter

  The Example Set Us by the Holy Fathers

   CONSIDER the lively examples set us by the saints, who possessed the
   light of true perfection and religion, and you will see how little, how
   nearly nothing, we do. What, alas, is our life, compared with theirs?
   The saints and friends of Christ served the Lord in hunger and thirst,
   in cold and nakedness, in work and fatigue, in vigils and fasts, in
   prayers and holy meditations, in persecutions and many afflictions. How
   many and severe were the trials they suffered--the Apostles, martyrs,
   confessors, virgins, and all the rest who willed to follow in the
   footsteps of Christ! They hated their lives on earth that they might
   have life in eternity.

   How strict and detached were the lives the holy hermits led in the
   desert! What long and grave temptations they suffered! How often were
   they beset by the enemy! What frequent and ardent prayers they offered
   to God! What rigorous fasts they observed! How great their zeal and
   their love for spiritual perfection! How brave the fight they waged to
   master their evil habits! What pure and straightforward purpose they
   showed toward God! By day they labored and by night they spent
   themselves in long prayers. Even at work they did not cease from mental
   prayer. They used all their time profitably; every hour seemed too
   short for serving God, and in the great sweetness of contemplation,
   they forgot even their bodily needs.

   They renounced all riches, dignities, honors, friends, and associates.
   They desired nothing of the world. They scarcely allowed themselves the
   necessities of life, and the service of the body, even when necessary,
   was irksome to them. They were poor in earthly things but rich in grace
   and virtue. Outwardly destitute, inwardly they were full of grace and
   divine consolation. Strangers to the world, they were close and
   intimate friends of God. To themselves they seemed as nothing, and they
   were despised by the world, but in the eyes of God they were precious
   and beloved. They lived in true humility and simple obedience; they
   walked in charity and patience, making progress daily on the pathway of
   spiritual life and obtaining great favor with God.

   They were given as an example for all religious, and their power to
   stimulate us to perfection ought to be greater than that of the
   lukewarm to tempt us to laxity.

   How great was the fervor of all religious in the beginning of their
   holy institution! How great their devotion in prayer and their rivalry
   for virtue! What splendid discipline flourished among them! What great
   reverence and obedience in all things under the rule of a superior! The
   footsteps they left behind still bear witness that they indeed were
   holy and perfect men who fought bravely and conquered the world.

   Today, he who is not a transgressor and who can bear patiently the
   duties which he has taken upon himself is considered great. How
   lukewarm and negligent we are! We lose our original fervor very quickly
   and we even become weary of life from laziness! Do not you, who have
   seen so many examples of the devout, fall asleep in the pursuit of
   virtue!

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Nineteenth Chapter

  The Practices of a Good Religious

   THE life of a good religious ought to abound in every virtue so that he
   is interiorly what to others he appears to be. With good reason there
   ought to be much more within than appears on the outside, for He who
   sees within is God, Whom we ought to reverence most highly wherever we
   are and in Whose sight we ought to walk pure as the angels.

   Each day we ought to renew our resolutions and arouse ourselves to
   fervor as though it were the first day of our religious life. We ought
   to say: "Help me, O Lord God, in my good resolution and in Your holy
   service. Grant me now, this very day, to begin perfectly, for thus far
   I have done nothing."

   As our intention is, so will be our progress; and he who desires
   perfection must be very diligent. If the strong-willed man fails
   frequently, what of the man who makes up his mind seldom or
   half-heartedly? Many are the ways of failing in our resolutions; even a
   slight omission of religious practice entails a loss of some kind.

   Just men depend on the grace of God rather than on their own wisdom in
   keeping their resolutions. In Him they confide every undertaking, for
   man, indeed, proposes but God disposes, and God's way is not man's. If
   a habitual exercise is sometimes omitted out of piety or in the
   interests of another, it can easily be resumed later. But if it be
   abandoned carelessly, through weariness or neglect, then the fault is
   great and will prove hurtful. Much as we try, we still fail too easily
   in many things. Yet we must always have some fixed purpose, especially
   against things which beset us the most. Our outward and inward lives
   alike must be closely watched and well ordered, for both are important
   to perfection.

   If you cannot recollect yourself continuously, do so once a day at
   least, in the morning or in the evening. In the morning make a
   resolution and in the evening examine yourself on what you have said
   this day, what you have done and thought, for in these things perhaps
   you have often offended God and those about you.

   Arm yourself like a man against the devil's assaults. Curb your
   appetite and you will more easily curb every inclination of the flesh.
   Never be completely unoccupied, but read or write or pray or meditate
   or do something for the common good. Bodily discipline, however, must
   be undertaken with discretion and is not to be practiced
   indiscriminately by everyone.

   Devotions not common to all are not to be displayed in public, for such
   personal things are better performed in private. Furthermore, beware of
   indifference to community prayer through love of your own devotions.
   If, however, after doing completely and faithfully all you are bound
   and commanded to do, you then have leisure, use it as personal piety
   suggests.

   Not everyone can have the same devotion. One exactly suits this person,
   another that. Different exercises, likewise, are suitable for different
   times, some for feast days and some again for weekdays. In time of
   temptation we need certain devotions. For days of rest and peace we
   need others. Some are suitable when we are sad, others when we are
   joyful in the Lord.

   About the time of the principal feasts good devotions ought to be
   renewed and the intercession of the saints more fervently implored.
   From one feast day to the next we ought to fix our purpose as though we
   were then to pass from this world and come to the eternal holyday.

   During holy seasons, finally, we ought to prepare ourselves carefully,
   to live holier lives, and to observe each rule more strictly, as though
   we were soon to receive from God the reward of our labors. If this end
   be deferred, let us believe that we are not well prepared and that we
   are not yet worthy of the great glory that shall in due time be
   revealed to us. Let us try, meanwhile, to prepare ourselves better for
   death.

   "Blessed is the servant," says Christ, "whom his master, when he
   cometh, shall find watching. Amen I say to you: he shall make him ruler
   over all his goods." [5]

    The Twentieth Chapter

  The Love of Solitude and Silence

   SEEK a suitable time for leisure and meditate often on the favors of
   God. Leave curiosities alone. Read such matters as bring sorrow to the
   heart rather than occupation to the mind. If you withdraw yourself from
   unnecessary talking and idle running about, from listening to gossip
   and rumors, you will find enough time that is suitable for holy
   meditation.

   Very many great saints avoided the company of men wherever possible and
   chose to serve God in retirement. "As often as I have been among men,"
   said one writer, "I have returned less a man." We often find this to be
   true when we take part in long conversations. It is easier to be silent
   altogether than not to speak too much. To stay at home is easier than
   to be sufficiently on guard while away. Anyone, then, who aims to live
   the inner and spiritual life must go apart, with Jesus, from the crowd.

   No man appears in safety before the public eye unless he first relishes
   obscurity. No man is safe in speaking unless he loves to be silent. No
   man rules safely unless he is willing to be ruled. No man commands
   safely unless he has learned well how to obey. No man rejoices safely
   unless he has within him the testimony of a good conscience.

   More than this, the security of the saints was always enveloped in the
   fear of God, nor were they less cautious and humble because they were
   conspicuous for great virtues and graces. The security of the wicked,
   on the contrary, springs from pride and presumption, and will end in
   their own deception.

   Never promise yourself security in this life, even though you seem to
   be a good religious, or a devout hermit. It happens very often that
   those whom men esteem highly are more seriously endangered by their own
   excessive confidence. Hence, for many it is better not to be too free
   from temptations, but often to be tried lest they become too secure,
   too filled with pride, or even too eager to fall back upon external
   comforts.

   If only a man would never seek passing joys or entangle himself with
   worldly affairs, what a good conscience he would have. What great peace
   and tranquillity would be his, if he cut himself off from all empty
   care and thought only of things divine, things helpful to his soul, and
   put all his trust in God.

   No man deserves the consolation of heaven unless he persistently
   arouses himself to holy contrition. If you desire true sorrow of heart,
   seek the privacy of your cell and shut out the uproar of the world, as
   it is written: "In your chamber bewail your sins." There you will find
   what too often you lose abroad.

   Your cell will become dear to you if you remain in it, but if you do
   not, it will become wearisome. If in the beginning of your religious
   life, you live within your cell and keep to it, it will soon become a
   special friend and a very great comfort.

   In silence and quiet the devout soul advances in virtue and learns the
   hidden truths of Scripture. There she finds a flood of tears with which
   to bathe and cleanse herself nightly, that she may become the more
   intimate with her Creator the farther she withdraws from all the tumult
   of the world. For God and His holy angels will draw near to him who
   withdraws from friends and acquaintances.

   It is better for a man to be obscure and to attend to his salvation
   than to neglect it and work miracles. It is praiseworthy for a
   religious seldom to go abroad, to flee the sight of men and have no
   wish to see them.

   Why wish to see what you are not permitted to have? "The world passes
   away and the concupiscence thereof." Sensual craving sometimes entices
   you to wander around, but when the moment is past, what do you bring
   back with you save a disturbed conscience and heavy heart? A happy
   going often leads to a sad return, a merry evening to a mournful dawn.
   Thus, all carnal joy begins sweetly but in the end brings remorse and
   death.

   What can you find elsewhere that you cannot find here in your cell?
   Behold heaven and earth and all the elements, for of these all things
   are made. What can you see anywhere under the sun that will remain
   long? Perhaps you think you will completely satisfy yourself, but you
   cannot do so, for if you should see all existing things, what would
   they be but an empty vision?

   Raise your eyes to God in heaven and pray because of your sins and
   shortcomings. Leave vanity to the vain. Set yourself to the things
   which God has commanded you to do. Close the door upon yourself and
   call to you Jesus, your Beloved. Remain with Him in your cell, for
   nowhere else will you find such peace. If you had not left it, and had
   not listened to idle gossip, you would have remained in greater peace.
   But since you love, sometimes, to hear news, it is only right that you
   should suffer sorrow of heart from it.

    The Twenty-First Chapter

  Sorrow of Heart

   IF YOU wish to make progress in virtue, live in the fear of the Lord,
   do not look for too much freedom, discipline your senses, and shun
   inane silliness. Sorrow opens the door to many a blessing which
   dissoluteness usually destroys.

   It is a wonder that any man who considers and meditates on his exiled
   state and the many dangers to his soul, can ever be perfectly happy in
   this life. Lighthearted and heedless of our defects, we do not feel the
   real sorrows of our souls, but often indulge in empty laughter when we
   have good reason to weep. No liberty is true and no joy is genuine
   unless it is founded in the fear of the Lord and a good conscience.

   Happy is the man who can throw off the weight of every care and
   recollect himself in holy contrition. Happy is the man who casts from
   him all that can stain or burden his conscience.

   Fight like a man. Habit is overcome by habit. If you leave men alone,
   they will leave you alone to do what you have to do. Do not busy
   yourself about the affairs of others and do not become entangled in the
   business of your superiors. Keep an eye primarily on yourself and
   admonish yourself instead of your friends.

   If you do not enjoy the favor of men, do not let it sadden you; but
   consider it a serious matter if you do not conduct yourself as well or
   as carefully as is becoming for a servant of God and a devout
   religious.

   It is often better and safer for us to have few consolations in this
   life, especially comforts of the body. Yet if we do not have divine
   consolation or experience it rarely, it is our own fault because we
   seek no sorrow of heart and do not forsake vain outward satisfaction.

   Consider yourself unworthy of divine solace and deserving rather of
   much tribulation. When a man is perfectly contrite, the whole world is
   bitter and wearisome to him.

   A good man always finds enough over which to mourn and weep; whether he
   thinks of himself or of his neighbor he knows that no one lives here
   without suffering, and the closer he examines himself the more he
   grieves.

   The sins and vices in which we are so entangled that we can rarely
   apply ourselves to the contemplation of heaven are matters for just
   sorrow and inner remorse.

   I do not doubt that you would correct yourself more earnestly if you
   would think more of an early death than of a long life. And if you
   pondered in your heart the future pains of hell or of purgatory, I
   believe you would willingly endure labor and trouble and would fear no
   hardship. But since these thoughts never pierce the heart and since we
   are enamored of flattering pleasure, we remain very cold and
   indifferent. Our wretched body complains so easily because our soul is
   altogether too lifeless.

   Pray humbly to the Lord, therefore, that He may give you the spirit of
   contrition and say with the Prophet: "Feed me, Lord, with the bread of
   mourning and give me to drink of tears in full measure." [6]

    The Twenty-Second Chapter

  Thoughts on the Misery of Man

   WHEREVER you are, wherever you go, you are miserable unless you turn to
   God. So why be dismayed when things do not happen as you wish and
   desire? Is there anyone who has everything as he wishes? No--neither I,
   nor you, nor any man on earth. There is no one in the world, be he Pope
   or king, who does not suffer trial and anguish.

   Who is the better off then? Surely, it is the man who will suffer
   something for God. Many unstable and weak-minded people say: "See how
   well that man lives, how rich, how great he is, how powerful and
   mighty." But you must lift up your eyes to the riches of heaven and
   realize that the material goods of which they speak are nothing. These
   things are uncertain and very burdensome because they are never
   possessed without anxiety and fear. Man's happiness does not consist in
   the possession of abundant goods; a very little is enough.

   Living on earth is truly a misery. The more a man desires spiritual
   life, the more bitter the present becomes to him, because he
   understands better and sees more clearly the defects, the corruption of
   human nature. To eat and drink, to watch and sleep, to rest, to labor,
   and to be bound by other human necessities is certainly a great misery
   and affliction to the devout man, who would gladly be released from
   them and be free from all sin. Truly, the inner man is greatly burdened
   in this world by the necessities of the body, and for this reason the
   Prophet prayed that he might be as free from them as possible, when he
   said: "From my necessities, O Lord, deliver me." [7]

   But woe to those who know not their own misery, and greater woe to
   those who love this miserable and corruptible life. Some, indeed, can
   scarcely procure its necessities either by work or by begging; yet they
   love it so much that, if they could live here always, they would care
   nothing for the kingdom of God.

   How foolish and faithless of heart are those who are so engrossed in
   earthly things as to relish nothing but what is carnal! Miserable men
   indeed, for in the end they will see to their sorrow how cheap and
   worthless was the thing they loved.

   The saints of God and all devout friends of Christ did not look to what
   pleases the body nor to the things that are popular from time to time.
   Their whole hope and aim centered on the everlasting good. Their whole
   desire pointed upward to the lasting and invisible realm, lest the love
   of what is visible drag them down to lower things.

   Do not lose heart, then, my brother, in pursuing your spiritual life.
   There is yet time, and your hour is not past. Why delay your purpose?
   Arise! Begin at once and say: "Now is the time to act, now is the time
   to fight, now is the proper time to amend."

   When you are troubled and afflicted, that is the time to gain merit.
   You must pass through water and fire before coming to rest. Unless you
   do violence to yourself you will not overcome vice.

   So long as we live in this fragile body, we can neither be free from
   sin nor live without weariness and sorrow. Gladly would we rest from
   all misery, but in losing innocence through sin we also lost true
   blessedness. Therefore, we must have patience and await the mercy of
   God until this iniquity passes, until mortality is swallowed up in
   life.

   How great is the frailty of human nature which is ever prone to evil!
   Today you confess your sins and tomorrow you again commit the sins
   which you confessed. One moment you resolve to be careful, and yet
   after an hour you act as though you had made no resolution.

   We have cause, therefore, because of our frailty and feebleness, to
   humble ourselves and never think anything great of ourselves. Through
   neglect we may quickly lose that which by God's grace we have acquired
   only through long, hard labor. What, eventually, will become of us who
   so quickly grow lukewarm? Woe to us if we presume to rest in peace and
   security when actually there is no true holiness in our lives. It would
   be beneficial for us, like good novices, to be instructed once more in
   the principles of a good life, to see if there be hope of amendment and
   greater spiritual progress in the future.

    The Twenty-Third Chapter

  Thoughts on Death

   VERY soon your life here will end; consider, then, what may be in store
   for you elsewhere. Today we live; tomorrow we die and are quickly
   forgotten. Oh, the dullness and hardness of a heart which looks only to
   the present instead of preparing for that which is to come!

   Therefore, in every deed and every thought, act as though you were to
   die this very day. If you had a good conscience you would not fear
   death very much. It is better to avoid sin than to fear death. If you
   are not prepared today, how will you be prepared tomorrow? Tomorrow is
   an uncertain day; how do you know you will have a tomorrow?

   What good is it to live a long life when we amend that life so little?
   Indeed, a long life does not always benefit us, but on the contrary,
   frequently adds to our guilt. Would that in this world we had lived
   well throughout one single day. Many count up the years they have spent
   in religion but find their lives made little holier. If it is so
   terrifying to die, it is nevertheless possible that to live longer is
   more dangerous. Blessed is he who keeps the moment of death ever before
   his eyes and prepares for it every day.

   If you have ever seen a man die, remember that you, too, must go the
   same way. In the morning consider that you may not live till evening,
   and when evening comes do not dare to promise yourself the dawn. Be
   always ready, therefore, and so live that death will never take you
   unprepared. Many die suddenly and unexpectedly, for in the unexpected
   hour the Son of God will come. When that last moment arrives you will
   begin to have a quite different opinion of the life that is now
   entirely past and you will regret very much that you were so careless
   and remiss.

   How happy and prudent is he who tries now in life to be what he wants
   to be found in death. Perfect contempt of the world, a lively desire to
   advance in virtue, a love for discipline, the works of penance,
   readiness to obey, self-denial, and the endurance of every hardship for
   the love of Christ, these will give a man great expectations of a happy
   death.

   You can do many good works when in good health; what can you do when
   you are ill? Few are made better by sickness. Likewise they who
   undertake many pilgrimages seldom become holy.

   Do not put your trust in friends and relatives, and do not put off the
   care of your soul till later, for men will forget you more quickly than
   you think. It is better to provide now, in time, and send some good
   account ahead of you than to rely on the help of others. If you do not
   care for your own welfare now, who will care when you are gone?

   The present is very precious; these are the days of salvation; now is
   the acceptable time. How sad that you do not spend the time in which
   you might purchase everlasting life in a better way. The time will come
   when you will want just one day, just one hour in which to make amends,
   and do you know whether you will obtain it?

   See, then, dearly beloved, the great danger from which you can free
   yourself and the great fear from which you can be saved, if only you
   will always be wary and mindful of death. Try to live now in such a
   manner that at the moment of death you may be glad rather than fearful.
   Learn to die to the world now, that then you may begin to live with
   Christ. Learn to spurn all things now, that then you may freely go to
   Him. Chastise your body in penance now, that then you may have the
   confidence born of certainty.

   Ah, foolish man, why do you plan to live long when you are not sure of
   living even a day? How many have been deceived and suddenly snatched
   away! How often have you heard of persons being killed by drownings, by
   fatal falls from high places, of persons dying at meals, at play, in
   fires, by the sword, in pestilence, or at the hands of robbers! Death
   is the end of everyone and the life of man quickly passes away like a
   shadow.

   Who will remember you when you are dead? Who will pray for you? Do now,
   beloved, what you can, because you do not know when you will die, nor
   what your fate will be after death. Gather for yourself the riches of
   immortality while you have time. Think of nothing but your salvation.
   Care only for the things of God. Make friends for yourself now by
   honoring the saints of God, by imitating their actions, so that when
   you depart this life they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.

   Keep yourself as a stranger here on earth, a pilgrim whom its affairs
   do not concern at all. Keep your heart free and raise it up to God, for
   you have not here a lasting home. To Him direct your daily prayers,
   your sighs and tears, that your soul may merit after death to pass in
   happiness to the Lord.

    The Twenty-Fourth Chapter

  Judgment and the Punishment of Sin

   IN ALL things consider the end; how you shall stand before the strict
   Judge from Whom nothing is hidden and Who will pronounce judgment in
   all justice, accepting neither bribes nor excuses. And you, miserable
   and wretched sinner, who fear even the countenance of an angry man,
   what answer will you make to the God Who knows all your sins? Why do
   you not provide for yourself against the day of judgment when no man
   can be excused or defended by another because each will have enough to
   do to answer for himself? In this life your work is profitable, your
   tears acceptable, your sighs audible, your sorrow satisfying and
   purifying.

   The patient man goes through a great and salutary purgatory when he
   grieves more over the malice of one who harms him than for his own
   injury; when he prays readily for his enemies and forgives offenses
   from his heart; when he does not hesitate to ask pardon of others; when
   he is more easily moved to pity than to anger; when he does frequent
   violence to himself and tries to bring the body into complete
   subjection to the spirit.

   It is better to atone for sin now and to cut away vices than to keep
   them for purgation in the hereafter. In truth, we deceive ourselves by
   our ill-advised love of the flesh. What will that fire feed upon but
   our sins? The more we spare ourselves now and the more we satisfy the
   flesh, the harder will the reckoning be and the more we keep for the
   burning.

   For a man will be more grievously punished in the things in which he
   has sinned. There the lazy will be driven with burning prongs, and
   gluttons tormented with unspeakable hunger and thirst; the wanton and
   lust-loving will be bathed in burning pitch and foul brimstone; the
   envious will howl in their grief like mad dogs.

   Every vice will have its own proper punishment. The proud will be faced
   with every confusion and the avaricious pinched with the most abject
   want. One hour of suffering there will be more bitter than a hundred
   years of the most severe penance here. In this life men sometimes rest
   from work and enjoy the comfort of friends, but the damned have no rest
   or consolation.

   You must, therefore, take care and repent of your sins now so that on
   the day of judgment you may rest secure with the blessed. For on that
   day the just will stand firm against those who tortured and oppressed
   them, and he who now submits humbly to the judgment of men will arise
   to pass judgment upon them. The poor and humble will have great
   confidence, while the proud will be struck with fear. He who learned to
   be a fool in this world and to be scorned for Christ will then appear
   to have been wise.

   In that day every trial borne in patience will be pleasing and the
   voice of iniquity will be stilled; the devout will be glad; the
   irreligious will mourn; and the mortified body will rejoice far more
   than if it had been pampered with every pleasure. Then the cheap
   garment will shine with splendor and the rich one become faded and
   worn; the poor cottage will be more praised than the gilded palace. In
   that day persevering patience will count more than all the power in
   this world; simple obedience will be exalted above all worldly
   cleverness; a good and clean conscience will gladden the heart of man
   far more than the philosophy of the learned; and contempt for riches
   will be of more weight than every treasure on earth.

   Then you will find more consolation in having prayed devoutly than in
   having fared daintily; you will be happy that you preferred silence to
   prolonged gossip.

   Then holy works will be of greater value than many fair words;
   strictness of life and hard penances will be more pleasing than all
   earthly delights.

   Learn, then, to suffer little things now that you may not have to
   suffer greater ones in eternity. Prove here what you can bear
   hereafter. If you can suffer only a little now, how will you be able to
   endure eternal torment? If a little suffering makes you impatient now,
   what will hell fire do? In truth, you cannot have two joys: you cannot
   taste the pleasures of this world and afterward reign with Christ.

   If your life to this moment had been full of honors and pleasures, what
   good would it do if at this instant you should die? All is vanity,
   therefore, except to love God and to serve Him alone.

   He who loves God with all his heart does not fear death or punishment
   or judgment or hell, because perfect love assures access to God.

   It is no wonder that he who still delights in sin fears death and
   judgment.

   It is good, however, that even if love does not as yet restrain you
   from evil, at least the fear of hell does. The man who casts aside the
   fear of God cannot continue long in goodness but will quickly fall into
   the snares of the devil.

    The Twenty-Fifth Chapter

  Zeal in Amending our Lives

   BE WATCHFUL and diligent in God's service and often think of why you
   left the world and came here. Was it not that you might live for God
   and become a spiritual man? Strive earnestly for perfection, then,
   because in a short time you will receive the reward of your labor, and
   neither fear nor sorrow shall come upon you at the hour of death.

   Labor a little now, and soon you shall find great rest, in truth,
   eternal joy; for if you continue faithful and diligent in doing, God
   will undoubtedly be faithful and generous in rewarding. Continue to
   have reasonable hope of gaining salvation, but do not act as though you
   were certain of it lest you grow indolent and proud.

   One day when a certain man who wavered often and anxiously between hope
   and fear was struck with sadness, he knelt in humble prayer before the
   altar of a church. While meditating on these things, he said: "Oh if I
   but knew whether I should persevere to the end!" Instantly he heard
   within the divine answer: "If you knew this, what would you do? Do now
   what you would do then and you will be quite secure." Immediately
   consoled and comforted, he resigned himself to the divine will and the
   anxious uncertainty ceased. His curiosity no longer sought to know what
   the future held for him, and he tried instead to find the perfect, the
   acceptable will of God in the beginning and end of every good work.

   "Trust thou in the Lord and do good," says the Prophet; "dwell in the
   land and thou shalt feed on its riches." [8]

   There is one thing that keeps many from zealously improving their
   lives, that is, dread of the difficulty, the toil of battle. Certainly
   they who try bravely to overcome the most difficult and unpleasant
   obstacles far outstrip others in the pursuit of virtue. A man makes the
   most progress and merits the most grace precisely in those matters
   wherein he gains the greatest victories over self and most mortifies
   his will. True, each one has his own difficulties to meet and conquer,
   but a diligent and sincere man will make greater progress even though
   he have more passions than one who is more even-tempered but less
   concerned about virtue.

   Two things particularly further improvement--to withdraw oneself
   forcibly from those vices to which nature is viciously inclined, and to
   work fervently for those graces which are most needed.

   Study also to guard against and to overcome the faults which in others
   very frequently displease you. Make the best of every opportunity, so
   that if you see or hear good example you may be moved to imitate it. On
   the other hand, take care lest you be guilty of those things which you
   consider reprehensible, or if you have ever been guilty of them, try to
   correct yourself as soon as possible. As you see others, so they see
   you.

   How pleasant and sweet to behold brethren fervent and devout, well
   mannered and disciplined! How sad and painful to see them wandering in
   dissolution, not practicing the things to which they are called! How
   hurtful it is to neglect the purpose of their vocation and to attend to
   what is not their business!

   Remember the purpose you have undertaken, and keep in mind the image of
   the Crucified. Even though you may have walked for many years on the
   pathway to God, you may well be ashamed if, with the image of Christ
   before you, you do not try to make yourself still more like Him.

   The religious who concerns himself intently and devoutly with our
   Lord's most holy life and passion will find there an abundance of all
   things useful and necessary for him. He need not seek for anything
   better than Jesus.

   If the Crucified should come to our hearts, how quickly and abundantly
   we would learn!

   A fervent religious accepts all the things that are commanded him and
   does them well, but a negligent and lukewarm religious has trial upon
   trial, and suffers anguish from every side because he has no
   consolation within and is forbidden to seek it from without. The
   religious who does not live up to his rule exposes himself to dreadful
   ruin, and he who wishes to be more free and untrammeled will always be
   in trouble, for something or other will always displease him.

   How do so many other religious who are confined in cloistered
   discipline get along? They seldom go out, they live in contemplation,
   their food is poor, their clothing coarse, they work hard, they speak
   but little, keep long vigils, rise early, pray much, read frequently,
   and subject themselves to all sorts of discipline. Think of the
   Carthusians and the Cistercians, the monks and nuns of different
   orders, how every night they rise to sing praise to the Lord. It would
   be a shame if you should grow lazy in such holy service when so many
   religious have already begun to rejoice in God.

   If there were nothing else to do but praise the Lord God with all your
   heart and voice, if you had never to eat, or drink, or sleep, but could
   praise God always and occupy yourself solely with spiritual pursuits,
   how much happier you would be than you are now, a slave to every
   necessity of the body! Would that there were no such needs, but only
   the spiritual refreshments of the soul which, sad to say, we taste too
   seldom!

   When a man reaches a point where he seeks no solace from any creature,
   then he begins to relish God perfectly. Then also he will be content no
   matter what may happen to him. He will neither rejoice over great
   things nor grieve over small ones, but will place himself entirely and
   confidently in the hands of God, Who for him is all in all, to Whom
   nothing ever perishes or dies, for Whom all things live, and Whom they
   serve as He desires.

   Always remember your end and do not forget that lost time never
   returns. Without care and diligence you will never acquire virtue. When
   you begin to grow lukewarm, you are falling into the beginning of evil;
   but if you give yourself to fervor, you will find peace and will
   experience less hardship because of God's grace and the love of virtue.

   A fervent and diligent man is ready for all things. It is greater work
   to resist vices and passions than to sweat in physical toil. He who
   does not overcome small faults, shall fall little by little into
   greater ones.

   If you have spent the day profitably, you will always be happy at
   eventide. Watch over yourself, arouse yourself, warn yourself, and
   regardless of what becomes of others, do not neglect yourself. The more
   violence you do to yourself, the more progress you will make.

  BOOK TWO


THE INTERIOR LIFE


     __________________________________________________________________

    The First Chapter

  Meditation

   THE kingdom of God is within you," says the Lord. [9]

   Turn, then, to God with all your heart. Forsake this wretched world and
   your soul shall find rest. Learn to despise external things, to devote
   yourself to those that are within, and you will see the kingdom of God
   come unto you, that kingdom which is peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,
   gifts not given to the impious.

   Christ will come to you offering His consolation, if you prepare a fit
   dwelling for Him in your heart, whose beauty and glory, wherein He
   takes delight, are all from within. His visits with the inward man are
   frequent, His communion sweet and full of consolation, His peace great,
   and His intimacy wonderful indeed.

   Therefore, faithful soul, prepare your heart for this Bridegroom that
   He may come and dwell within you; He Himself says: "If any one love Me,
   he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to
   him, and will make Our abode with him." [10]

   Give place, then, to Christ, but deny entrance to all others, for when
   you have Christ you are rich and He is sufficient for you. He will
   provide for you. He will supply your every want, so that you need not
   trust in frail, changeable men. Christ remains forever, standing firmly
   with us to the end.

   Do not place much confidence in weak and mortal man, helpful and
   friendly though he be; and do not grieve too much if he sometimes
   opposes and contradicts you. Those who are with us today may be against
   us tomorrow, and vice versa, for men change with the wind. Place all
   your trust in God; let Him be your fear and your love. He will answer
   for you; He will do what is best for you.

   You have here no lasting home. You are a stranger and a pilgrim
   wherever you may be, and you shall have no rest until you are wholly
   united with Christ.

   Why do you look about here when this is not the place of your repose?
   Dwell rather upon heaven and give but a passing glance to all earthly
   things. They all pass away, and you together with them. Take care,
   then, that you do not cling to them lest you be entrapped and perish.
   Fix your mind on the Most High, and pray unceasingly to Christ.

   If you do not know how to meditate on heavenly things, direct your
   thoughts to Christ's passion and willingly behold His sacred wounds. If
   you turn devoutly to the wounds and precious stigmata of Christ, you
   will find great comfort in suffering, you will mind but little the
   scorn of men, and you will easily bear their slanderous talk.

   When Christ was in the world, He was despised by men; in the hour of
   need He was forsaken by acquaintances and left by friends to the depths
   of scorn. He was willing to suffer and to be despised; do you dare to
   complain of anything? He had enemies and defamers; do you want everyone
   to be your friend, your benefactor? How can your patience be rewarded
   if no adversity test it? How can you be a friend of Christ if you are
   not willing to suffer any hardship? Suffer with Christ and for Christ
   if you wish to reign with Him.

   Had you but once entered into perfect communion with Jesus or tasted a
   little of His ardent love, you would care nothing at all for your own
   comfort or discomfort but would rejoice in the reproach you suffer; for
   love of Him makes a man despise himself.

   A man who is a lover of Jesus and of truth, a truly interior man who is
   free from uncontrolled affections, can turn to God at will and rise
   above himself to enjoy spiritual peace.

   He who tastes life as it really is, not as men say or think it is, is
   indeed wise with the wisdom of God rather than of men.

   He who learns to live the interior life and to take little account of
   outward things, does not seek special places or times to perform devout
   exercises. A spiritual man quickly recollects himself because he has
   never wasted his attention upon externals. No outside work, no business
   that cannot wait stands in his way. He adjusts himself to things as
   they happen. He whose disposition is well ordered cares nothing about
   the strange, perverse behavior of others, for a man is upset and
   distracted only in proportion as he engrosses himself in externals.

   If all were well with you, therefore, and if you were purified from all
   sin, everything would tend to your good and be to your profit. But
   because you are as yet neither entirely dead to self nor free from all
   earthly affection, there is much that often displeases and disturbs
   you. Nothing so mars and defiles the heart of man as impure attachment
   to created things. But if you refuse external consolation, you will be
   able to contemplate heavenly things and often to experience interior
   joy.

    The Second Chapter

  Humility

   BE NOT troubled about those who are with you or against you, but take
   care that God be with you in everything you do. Keep your conscience
   clear and God will protect you, for the malice of man cannot harm one
   whom God wishes to help. If you know how to suffer in silence, you will
   undoubtedly experience God's help. He knows when and how to deliver
   you; therefore, place yourself in His hands, for it is a divine
   prerogative to help men and free them from all distress.

   It is often good for us to have others know our faults and rebuke them,
   for it gives us greater humility. When a man humbles himself because of
   his faults, he easily placates those about him and readily appeases
   those who are angry with him.

   It is the humble man whom God protects and liberates; it is the humble
   whom He loves and consoles. To the humble He turns and upon them
   bestows great grace, that after their humiliation He may raise them up
   to glory. He reveals His secrets to the humble, and with kind
   invitation bids them come to Him. Thus, the humble man enjoys peace in
   the midst of many vexations, because his trust is in God, not in the
   world. Hence, you must not think that you have made any progress until
   you look upon yourself as inferior to all others.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Third Chapter

  Goodness and Peace in Man

   FIRST keep peace with yourself; then you will be able to bring peace to
   others. A peaceful man does more good than a learned man. Whereas a
   passionate man turns even good to evil and is quick to believe evil,
   the peaceful man, being good himself, turns all things to good.

   The man who is at perfect ease is never suspicious, but the disturbed
   and discontented spirit is upset by many a suspicion. He neither rests
   himself nor permits others to do so. He often says what ought not to be
   said and leaves undone what ought to be done. He is concerned with the
   duties of others but neglects his own.

   Direct your zeal, therefore, first upon yourself; then you may with
   justice exercise it upon those about you. You are well versed in
   coloring your own actions with excuses which you will not accept from
   others, though it would be more just to accuse yourself and excuse your
   brother. If you wish men to bear with you, you must bear with them.
   Behold, how far you are from true charity and humility which does not
   know how to be angry with anyone, or to be indignant save only against
   self!

   It is no great thing to associate with the good and gentle, for such
   association is naturally pleasing. Everyone enjoys a peaceful life and
   prefers persons of congenial habits. But to be able to live at peace
   with harsh and perverse men, or with the undisciplined and those who
   irritate us, is a great grace, a praiseworthy and manly thing.

   Some people live at peace with themselves and with their fellow men,
   but others are never at peace with themselves nor do they bring it to
   anyone else. These latter are a burden to everyone, but they are more
   of a burden to themselves. A few, finally, live at peace with
   themselves and try to restore it to others.

   Now, all our peace in this miserable life is found in humbly enduring
   suffering rather than in being free from it. He who knows best how to
   suffer will enjoy the greater peace, because he is the conqueror of
   himself, the master of the world, a friend of Christ, and an heir of
   heaven.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fourth Chapter

  Purity of Mind and Unity of Purpose

   A MAN is raised up from the earth by two wings--simplicity and purity.
   There must be simplicity in his intention and purity in his desires.
   Simplicity leads to God, purity embraces and enjoys Him.

   If your heart is free from ill-ordered affection, no good deed will be
   difficult for you. If you aim at and seek after nothing but the
   pleasure of God and the welfare of your neighbor, you will enjoy
   freedom within.

   If your heart were right, then every created thing would be a mirror of
   life for you and a book of holy teaching, for there is no creature so
   small and worthless that it does not show forth the goodness of God. If
   inwardly you were good and pure, you would see all things clearly and
   understand them rightly, for a pure heart penetrates to heaven and
   hell, and as a man is within, so he judges what is without. If there be
   joy in the world, the pure of heart certainly possess it; and if there
   be anguish and affliction anywhere, an evil conscience knows it too
   well.

   As iron cast into fire loses its rust and becomes glowing white, so he
   who turns completely to God is stripped of his sluggishness and changed
   into a new man. When a man begins to grow lax, he fears a little toil
   and welcomes external comfort, but when he begins perfectly to conquer
   himself and to walk bravely in the ways of God, then he thinks those
   things less difficult which he thought so hard before.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifth Chapter

  Ourselves

   WE MUST not rely too much upon ourselves, for grace and understanding
   are often lacking in us. We have but little inborn light, and this we
   quickly lose through negligence. Often we are not aware that we are so
   blind in heart. Meanwhile we do wrong, and then do worse in excusing
   it. At times we are moved by passion, and we think it zeal. We take
   others to task for small mistakes, and overlook greater ones in
   ourselves. We are quick enough to feel and brood over the things we
   suffer from others, but we think nothing of how much others suffer from
   us. If a man would weigh his own deeds fully and rightly, he would find
   little cause to pass severe judgment on others.

   The interior man puts the care of himself before all other concerns,
   and he who attends to himself carefully does not find it hard to hold
   his tongue about others. You will never be devout of heart unless you
   are thus silent about the affairs of others and pay particular
   attention to yourself. If you attend wholly to God and yourself, you
   will be little disturbed by what you see about you.

   Where are your thoughts when they are not upon yourself? And after
   attending to various things, what have you gained if you have neglected
   self? If you wish to have true peace of mind and unity of purpose, you
   must cast all else aside and keep only yourself before your eyes.

   You will make great progress if you keep yourself free from all
   temporal cares, for to value anything that is temporal is a great
   mistake. Consider nothing great, nothing high, nothing pleasing,
   nothing acceptable, except God Himself or that which is of God.
   Consider the consolations of creatures as vanity, for the soul that
   loves God scorns all things that are inferior to Him. God alone, the
   eternal and infinite, satisfies all, bringing comfort to the soul and
   true joy to the body.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Sixth Chapter

  The Joy of a Good Conscience

   THE glory of a good man is the testimony of a good conscience.
   Therefore, keep your conscience good and you will always enjoy
   happiness, for a good conscience can bear a great deal and can bring
   joy even in the midst of adversity. But an evil conscience is ever
   restive and fearful.

   Sweet shall be your rest if your heart does not reproach you.

   Do not rejoice unless you have done well. Sinners never experience true
   interior joy or peace, for "there is no peace to the wicked," says the
   Lord. [11] Even if they say: "We are at peace, no evil shall befall us
   and no one dares to hurt us," do not believe them; for the wrath of God
   will arise quickly, and their deeds will be brought to naught and their
   thoughts will perish.

   To glory in adversity is not hard for the man who loves, for this is to
   glory in the cross of the Lord. But the glory given or received of men
   is short lived, and the glory of the world is ever companioned by
   sorrow. The glory of the good, however, is in their conscience and not
   in the lips of men, for the joy of the just is from God and in God, and
   their gladness is founded on truth.

   The man who longs for the true, eternal glory does not care for that of
   time; and he who seeks passing fame or does not in his heart despise
   it, undoubtedly cares little for the glory of heaven.

   He who minds neither praise nor blame possesses great peace of heart
   and, if his conscience is good, he will easily be contented and at
   peace.

   Praise adds nothing to your holiness, nor does blame take anything from
   it. You are what you are, and you cannot be said to be better than you
   are in God's sight. If you consider well what you are within, you will
   not care what men say about you. They look to appearances but God looks
   to the heart. They consider the deed but God weighs the motive.

   It is characteristic of a humble soul always to do good and to think
   little of itself. It is a mark of great purity and deep faith to look
   for no consolation in created things. The man who desires no
   justification from without has clearly entrusted himself to God: "For
   not he who commendeth himself is approved," says St. Paul, "but he whom
   God commendeth." [12]

   To walk with God interiorly, to be free from any external
   affection--this is the state of the inward man.

    The Seventh Chapter

  Loving Jesus Above All Things

   BLESSED is he who appreciates what it is to love Jesus and who despises
   himself for the sake of Jesus. Give up all other love for His, since He
   wishes to be loved alone above all things.

   Affection for creatures is deceitful and inconstant, but the love of
   Jesus is true and enduring. He who clings to a creature will fall with
   its frailty, but he who gives himself to Jesus will ever be
   strengthened.

   Love Him, then; keep Him as a friend. He will not leave you as others
   do, or let you suffer lasting death. Sometime, whether you will or not,
   you will have to part with everything. Cling, therefore, to Jesus in
   life and death; trust yourself to the glory of Him who alone can help
   you when all others fail.

   Your Beloved is such that He will not accept what belongs to
   another--He wants your heart for Himself alone, to be enthroned therein
   as King in His own right. If you but knew how to free yourself entirely
   from all creatures, Jesus would gladly dwell within you.

   You will find, apart from Him, that nearly all the trust you place in
   men is a total loss. Therefore, neither confide in nor depend upon a
   wind-shaken reed, for "all flesh is grass" [13] and all its glory, like
   the flower of grass, will fade away.

   You will quickly be deceived if you look only to the outward appearance
   of men, and you will often be disappointed if you seek comfort and gain
   in them. If, however, you seek Jesus in all things, you will surely
   find Him. Likewise, if you seek yourself, you will find yourself--to
   your own ruin. For the man who does not seek Jesus does himself much
   greater harm than the whole world and all his enemies could ever do.


     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] Isa. 15:6.

    The Eighth Chapter

  The Intimate Friendship of Jesus

   WHEN Jesus is near, all is well and nothing seems difficult. When He is
   absent, all is hard. When Jesus does not speak within, all other
   comfort is empty, but if He says only a word, it brings great
   consolation.

   Did not Mary Magdalen rise at once from her weeping when Martha said to
   her: "The Master is come, and calleth for thee"? [14] Happy is the hour
   when Jesus calls one from tears to joy of spirit.

   How dry and hard you are without Jesus! How foolish and vain if you
   desire anything but Him! Is it not a greater loss than losing the whole
   world? For what, without Jesus, can the world give you? Life without
   Him is a relentless hell, but living with Him is a sweet paradise. If
   Jesus be with you, no enemy can harm you.

   He who finds Jesus finds a rare treasure, indeed, a good above every
   good, whereas he who loses Him loses more than the whole world. The man
   who lives without Jesus is the poorest of the poor, whereas no one is
   so rich as the man who lives in His grace.

   It is a great art to know how to converse with Jesus, and great wisdom
   to know how to keep Him. Be humble and peaceful, and Jesus will be with
   you. Be devout and calm, and He will remain with you. You may quickly
   drive Him away and lose His grace, if you turn back to the outside
   world. And, if you drive Him away and lose Him, to whom will you go and
   whom will you then seek as a friend? You cannot live well without a
   friend, and if Jesus be not your friend above all else, you will be
   very sad and desolate. Thus, you are acting foolishly if you trust or
   rejoice in any other. Choose the opposition of the whole world rather
   than offend Jesus. Of all those who are dear to you, let Him be your
   special love. Let all things be loved for the sake of Jesus, but Jesus
   for His own sake.

   Jesus Christ must be loved alone with a special love for He alone, of
   all friends, is good and faithful. For Him and in Him you must love
   friends and foes alike, and pray to Him that all may know and love Him.

   Never desire special praise or love, for that belongs to God alone Who
   has no equal. Never wish that anyone's affection be centered in you,
   nor let yourself be taken up with the love of anyone, but let Jesus be
   in you and in every good man. Be pure and free within, unentangled with
   any creature.

   You must bring to God a clean and open heart if you wish to attend and
   see how sweet the Lord is. Truly you will never attain this happiness
   unless His grace prepares you and draws you on so that you may forsake
   all things to be united with Him alone.

   When the grace of God comes to a man he can do all things, but when it
   leaves him he becomes poor and weak, abandoned, as it were, to
   affliction. Yet, in this condition he should not become dejected or
   despair. On the contrary, he should calmly await the will of God and
   bear whatever befalls him in praise of Jesus Christ, for after winter
   comes summer, after night, the day, and after the storm, a great calm.

    The Ninth Chapter

  Wanting No Share in Comfort

   IT IS not hard to spurn human consolation when we have the divine. It
   is, however, a very great thing indeed to be able to live without
   either divine or human comforting and for the honor of God willingly to
   endure this exile of heart, not to seek oneself in anything, and to
   think nothing of one's own merit.

   Does it matter much, if at the coming of grace, you are cheerful and
   devout? This is an hour desired by all, for he whom the grace of God
   sustains travels easily enough. What wonder if he feel no burden when
   borne up by the Almighty and led on by the Supreme Guide! For we are
   always glad to have something to comfort us, and only with difficulty
   does a man divest himself of self.

   The holy martyr, Lawrence, with his priest, conquered the world because
   he despised everything in it that seemed pleasing to him, and for love
   of Christ patiently suffered the great high priest of God, Sixtus, whom
   he loved dearly, to be taken from him. Thus, by his love for the
   Creator he overcame the love of man, and chose instead of human
   consolation the good pleasure of God. So you, too, must learn to part
   with an intimate and much-needed friend for the love of God. Do not
   take it to heart when you are deserted by a friend, knowing that in the
   end we must all be parted from one another.

   A man must fight long and bravely against himself before he learns to
   master himself fully and to direct all his affections toward God. When
   he trusts in himself, he easily takes to human consolation. The true
   lover of Christ, however, who sincerely pursues virtue, does not fall
   back upon consolations nor seek such pleasures of sense, but prefers
   severe trials and hard labors for the sake of Christ.

   When, therefore, spiritual consolation is given by God, receive it
   gratefully, but understand that it is His gift and not your meriting.
   Do not exult, do not be overjoyed, do not be presumptuous, but be the
   humbler for the gift, more careful and wary in all your actions, for
   this hour will pass and temptation will come in its wake.

   When consolation is taken away, do not at once despair but wait humbly
   and patiently for the heavenly visit, since God can restore to you more
   abundant solace.

   This is neither new nor strange to one who knows God's ways, for such
   change of fortune often visited the great saints and prophets of old.
   Thus there was one who, when grace was with him, declared: "In my
   prosperity I said: I shall never be moved.'" But when grace was taken
   away, he adds what he experienced in himself: "Thou didst hide Thy
   face, and I was troubled." Meanwhile he does not despair; rather he
   prays more earnestly to the Lord, saying: "To Thee, O Lord, will I cry;
   and I will make supplication to my God." At length, he receives the
   fruit of his prayer, and testifying that he was heard, says "The Lord
   hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my helper." And
   how was he helped? "Thou hast turned," he says, "my mourning into joy,
   and hast surrounded me with gladness." [15]

   If this is the case with great saints, we who are weak and poor ought
   not to despair because we are fervent at times and at other times cold,
   for the spirit comes and goes according to His will. Of this the
   blessed Job declared: "Thou visitest him early in the morning, and Thou
   provest him suddenly." [16]

   In what can I hope, then, or in whom ought I trust, save only in the
   great mercy of God and the hope of heavenly grace? For though I have
   with me good men, devout brethren, faithful friends, holy books,
   beautiful treatises, sweet songs and hymns, all these help and please
   but little when I am abandoned by grace and left to my poverty. At such
   times there is no better remedy than patience and resignation of self
   to the will of God.

   I have never met a man so religious and devout that he has not
   experienced at some time a withdrawal of grace and felt a lessening of
   fervor. No saint was so sublimely rapt and enlightened as not to be
   tempted before and after. He, indeed, is not worthy of the sublime
   contemplation of God who has not been tried by some tribulation for the
   sake of God. For temptation is usually the sign preceding the
   consolation that is to follow, and heavenly consolation is promised to
   all those proved by temptation. "To him that overcometh," says Christ,
   "I will give to eat of the Tree of Life." [17] Divine consolation,
   then, is given in order to make a man braver in enduring adversity, and
   temptation follows in order that he may not pride himself on the good
   he has done.

   The devil does not sleep, nor is the flesh yet dead; therefore, you
   must never cease your preparation for battle, because on the right and
   on the left are enemies who never rest.

    The Tenth Chapter

  Appreciating God's Grace

   WHY do you look for rest when you were born to work? Resign yourself to
   patience rather than to comfort, to carrying your cross rather than to
   enjoyment.

   What man in the world, if he could always have them, would not readily
   accept consolation and spiritual joy, benefits which excel all earthly
   delights and pleasures of the body? The latter, indeed, are either vain
   or base, while spiritual joys, born of virtue and infused by God into
   pure minds, are alone truly pleasant and noble.

   Now, since the moment of temptation is always nigh, since false freedom
   of mind and overconfidence in self are serious obstacles to these
   visitations from heaven, a man can never enjoy them just as he wishes.

   God does well in giving the grace of consolation, but man does evil in
   not returning everything gratefully to God. Thus, the gifts of grace
   cannot flow in us when we are ungrateful to the Giver, when we do not
   return them to the Fountainhead. Grace is always given to him who is
   duly grateful, and what is wont to be given the humble will be taken
   away from the proud.

   I do not desire consolation that robs me of contrition, nor do I care
   for contemplation that leads to pride, for not all that is high is
   holy, nor is all that is sweet good, nor every desire pure, nor all
   that is dear to us pleasing to God. I accept willingly the grace
   whereby I become more humble and contrite, more willing to renounce
   self.

   The man who has been taught by the gift of grace, and who learns by the
   lash of its withdrawal, will never dare to attribute any good to
   himself, but will rather admit his poverty and emptiness. Give to God
   what is God's and ascribe to yourself what is yours. Give Him thanks,
   then, for His grace, but place upon yourself alone the blame and the
   punishment your fault deserves.

   Always take the lowest place and the highest will be given you, for the
   highest cannot exist apart from the lowest. The saints who are greatest
   before God are those who consider themselves the least, and the more
   humble they are within themselves, so much the more glorious they are.
   Since they do not desire vainglory, they are full of truth and heavenly
   glory. Being established and strengthened in God, they can by no means
   be proud. They attribute to God whatever good they have received; they
   seek no glory from one another but only that which comes from God
   alone. They desire above all things that He be praised in themselves
   and in all His saints--this is their constant purpose.

   Be grateful, therefore, for the least gift and you will be worthy to
   receive a greater. Consider the least gift as the greatest, the most
   contemptible as something special. And, if you but look to the dignity
   of the Giver, no gift will appear too small or worthless. Even though
   He give punishments and scourges, accept them, because He acts for our
   welfare in whatever He allows to befall us.

   He who desires to keep the grace of God ought to be grateful when it is
   given and patient when it is withdrawn. Let him pray that it return;
   let him be cautious and humble lest he lose it.

    The Eleventh Chapter

  Few Love the Cross of Jesus

   JESUS has always many who love His heavenly kingdom, but few who bear
   His cross. He has many who desire consolation, but few who care for
   trial. He finds many to share His table, but few to take part in His
   fasting. All desire to be happy with Him; few wish to suffer anything
   for Him. Many follow Him to the breaking of bread, but few to the
   drinking of the chalice of His passion. Many revere His miracles; few
   approach the shame of the Cross. Many love Him as long as they
   encounter no hardship; many praise and bless Him as long as they
   receive some comfort from Him. But if Jesus hides Himself and leaves
   them for a while, they fall either into complaints or into deep
   dejection. Those, on the contrary, who love Him for His own sake and
   not for any comfort of their own, bless Him in all trial and anguish of
   heart as well as in the bliss of consolation. Even if He should never
   give them consolation, yet they would continue to praise Him and wish
   always to give Him thanks. What power there is in pure love for
   Jesus--love that is free from all self-interest and self-love!

   Do not those who always seek consolation deserve to be called
   mercenaries? Do not those who always think of their own profit and gain
   prove that they love themselves rather than Christ? Where can a man be
   found who desires to serve God for nothing? Rarely indeed is a man so
   spiritual as to strip himself of all things. And who shall find a man
   so truly poor in spirit as to be free from every creature? His value is
   like that of things brought from the most distant lands.

   If a man give all his wealth, it is nothing; if he do great penance, it
   is little; if he gain all knowledge, he is still far afield; if he have
   great virtue and much ardent devotion, he still lacks a great deal, and
   especially, the one thing that is most necessary to him. What is this
   one thing? That leaving all, he forsake himself, completely renounce
   himself, and give up all private affections. Then, when he has done all
   that he knows ought to be done, let him consider it as nothing, let him
   make little of what may be considered great; let him in all honesty
   call himself an unprofitable servant. For truth itself has said: "When
   you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: we
   are unprofitable servants.'" [18]

   Then he will be truly poor and stripped in spirit, and with the prophet
   may say: "I am alone and poor." [19] No one, however, is more wealthy
   than such a man; no one is more powerful, no one freer than he who
   knows how to leave all things and think of himself as the least of all.

    The Twelfth Chapter

  The Royal Road of the Holy Cross

   TO MANY the saying, "Deny thyself, take up thy cross and follow Me,"
   [20] seems hard, but it will be much harder to hear that final word:
   "Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." [21] Those who hear
   the word of the cross and follow it willingly now, need not fear that
   they will hear of eternal damnation on the day of judgment. This sign
   of the cross will be in the heavens when the Lord comes to judge. Then
   all the servants of the cross, who during life made themselves one with
   the Crucified, will draw near with great trust to Christ, the judge.

   Why, then, do you fear to take up the cross when through it you can win
   a kingdom? In the cross is salvation, in the cross is life, in the
   cross is protection from enemies, in the cross is infusion of heavenly
   sweetness, in the cross is strength of mind, in the cross is joy of
   spirit, in the cross is highest virtue, in the cross is perfect
   holiness. There is no salvation of soul nor hope of everlasting life
   but in the cross.

   Take up your cross, therefore, and follow Jesus, and you shall enter
   eternal life. He Himself opened the way before you in carrying His
   cross, and upon it He died for you, that you, too, might take up your
   cross and long to die upon it. If you die with Him, you shall also live
   with Him, and if you share His suffering, you shall also share His
   glory.

   Behold, in the cross is everything, and upon your dying on the cross
   everything depends. There is no other way to life and to true inward
   peace than the way of the holy cross and daily mortification. Go where
   you will, seek what you will, you will not find a higher way, nor a
   less exalted but safer way, than the way of the holy cross. Arrange and
   order everything to suit your will and judgment, and still you will
   find that some suffering must always be borne, willingly or
   unwillingly, and thus you will always find the cross.

   Either you will experience bodily pain or you will undergo tribulation
   of spirit in your soul. At times you will be forsaken by God, at times
   troubled by those about you and, what is worse, you will often grow
   weary of yourself. You cannot escape, you cannot be relieved by any
   remedy or comfort but must bear with it as long as God wills. For He
   wishes you to learn to bear trial without consolation, to submit
   yourself wholly to Him that you may become more humble through
   suffering. No one understands the passion of Christ so thoroughly or
   heartily as the man whose lot it is to suffer the like himself.

   The cross, therefore, is always ready; it awaits you everywhere. No
   matter where you may go, you cannot escape it, for wherever you go you
   take yourself with you and shall always find yourself. Turn where you
   will--above, below, without, or within--you will find a cross in
   everything, and everywhere you must have patience if you would have
   peace within and merit an eternal crown.

   If you carry the cross willingly, it will carry and lead you to the
   desired goal where indeed there shall be no more suffering, but here
   there shall be. If you carry it unwillingly, you create a burden for
   yourself and increase the load, though still you have to bear it. If
   you cast away one cross, you will find another and perhaps a heavier
   one. Do you expect to escape what no mortal man can ever avoid? Which
   of the saints was without a cross or trial on this earth? Not even
   Jesus Christ, our Lord, Whose every hour on earth knew the pain of His
   passion. "It behooveth Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the
   dead, . . . and so enter into his glory." [22] How is it that you look
   for another way than this, the royal way of the holy cross?

   The whole life of Christ was a cross and a martyrdom, and do you seek
   rest and enjoyment for yourself? You deceive yourself, you are mistaken
   if you seek anything but to suffer, for this mortal life is full of
   miseries and marked with crosses on all sides. Indeed, the more
   spiritual progress a person makes, so much heavier will he frequently
   find the cross, because as his love increases, the pain of his exile
   also increases.

   Yet such a man, though afflicted in many ways, is not without hope of
   consolation, because he knows that great reward is coming to him for
   bearing his cross. And when he carries it willingly, every pang of
   tribulation is changed into hope of solace from God. Besides, the more
   the flesh is distressed by affliction, so much the more is the spirit
   strengthened by inward grace. Not infrequently a man is so strengthened
   by his love of trials and hardship in his desire to conform to the
   cross of Christ, that he does not wish to be without sorrow or pain,
   since he believes he will be the more acceptable to God if he is able
   to endure more and more grievous things for His sake.

   It is the grace of Christ, and not the virtue of man, which can and
   does bring it about that through fervor of spirit frail flesh learns to
   love and to gain what it naturally hates and shuns.

   To carry the cross, to love the cross, to chastise the body and bring
   it to subjection, to flee honors, to endure contempt gladly, to despise
   self and wish to be despised, to suffer any adversity and loss, to
   desire no prosperous days on earth--this is not man's way. If you rely
   upon yourself, you can do none of these things, but if you trust in the
   Lord, strength will be given you from heaven and the world and the
   flesh will be made subject to your word. You will not even fear your
   enemy, the devil, if you are armed with faith and signed with the cross
   of Christ.

   Set yourself, then, like a good and faithful servant of Christ, to bear
   bravely the cross of your Lord, Who out of love was crucified for you.
   Be ready to suffer many adversities and many kinds of trouble in this
   miserable life, for troublesome and miserable life will always be, no
   matter where you are; and so you will find it wherever you may hide.
   Thus it must be; and there is no way to evade the trials and sorrows of
   life but to bear them.

   Drink the chalice of the Lord with affection if you wish to be His
   friend and to have part with Him. Leave consolation to God; let Him do
   as most pleases Him. On your part, be ready to bear sufferings and
   consider them the greatest consolation, for even though you alone were
   to undergo them all, the sufferings of this life are not worthy to be
   compared with the glory to come.

   When you shall have come to the point where suffering is sweet and
   acceptable for the sake of Christ, then consider yourself fortunate,
   for you have found paradise on earth. But as long as suffering irks you
   and you seek to escape, so long will you be unfortunate, and the
   tribulation you seek to evade will follow you everywhere. If you put
   your mind to the things you ought to consider, that is, to suffering
   and death, you would soon be in a better state and would find peace.

   Although you were taken to the third heaven with Paul, you were not
   thereby insured against suffering. Jesus said: "I will show him how
   great things he must suffer for My name's sake." [23] To suffer, then,
   remains your lot, if you mean to love Jesus and serve Him forever.

   If you were but worthy to suffer something for the name of Jesus, what
   great glory would be in store for you, what great joy to all the saints
   of God, what great edification to those about you! For all men praise
   patience though there are few who wish to practice it.

   With good reason, then, ought you to be willing to suffer a little for
   Christ since many suffer much more for the world.

   Realize that you must lead a dying life; the more a man dies to
   himself, the more he begins to live unto God.

   No man is fit to enjoy heaven unless he has resigned himself to suffer
   hardship for Christ. Nothing is more acceptable to God, nothing more
   helpful for you on this earth than to suffer willingly for Christ. If
   you had to make a choice, you ought to wish rather to suffer for Christ
   than to enjoy many consolations, for thus you would be more like Christ
   and more like all the saints. Our merit and progress consist not in
   many pleasures and comforts but rather in enduring great afflictions
   and sufferings.

   If, indeed, there were anything better or more useful for man's
   salvation than suffering, Christ would have shown it by word and
   example. But He clearly exhorts the disciples who follow Him and all
   who wish to follow Him to carry the cross, saying: "If any man will
   come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
   follow Me." [24]

   When, therefore, we have read and searched all that has been written,
   let this be the final conclusion--that through much suffering we must
   enter into the kingdom of God.

INTERNAL CONSOLATION



     __________________________________________________________________

    The First Chapter

  The Inward Conversation of Christ with the Faithful Soul

   I WILL hear what the Lord God will speak in me." [25]

   Blessed is the soul who hears the Lord speaking within her, who
   receives the word of consolation from His lips. Blessed are the ears
   that catch the accents of divine whispering, and pay no heed to the
   murmurings of this world. Blessed indeed are the ears that listen, not
   to the voice which sounds without, but to the truth which teaches
   within. Blessed are the eyes which are closed to exterior things and
   are fixed upon those which are interior. Blessed are they who penetrate
   inwardly, who try daily to prepare themselves more and more to
   understand mysteries. Blessed are they who long to give their time to
   God, and who cut themselves off from the hindrances of the world.

   Consider these things, my soul, and close the door of your senses, so
   that you can hear what the Lord your God speaks within you. "I am your
   salvation," says your Beloved. "I am your peace and your life. Remain
   with Me and you will find peace. Dismiss all passing things and seek
   the eternal. What are all temporal things but snares? And what help
   will all creatures be able to give you if you are deserted by the
   Creator?" Leave all these things, therefore, and make yourself pleasing
   and faithful to your Creator so that you may attain to true happiness.

  Truth Speaks Inwardly Without the Sound of Words


    The Disciple

   SPEAK, Lord, for Thy servant heareth." [26] "I am Thy servant. Give me
   understanding that I may know Thine ordinances [27] . . . Incline my
   heart to Thine ordinances [28] . . . Let Thy speech distil as the dew."
   [29]

   The children of Israel once said to Moses: "Speak thou to us and we
   will hear thee: let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die." [30]

   Not so, Lord, not so do I pray. Rather with Samuel the prophet I
   entreat humbly and earnestly: "Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth."
   Do not let Moses or any of the prophets speak to me; but You speak, O
   Lord God, Who inspired and enlightened all the prophets; for You alone,
   without them, can instruct me perfectly, whereas they, without You, can
   do nothing. They, indeed, utter fine words, but they cannot impart the
   spirit. They do indeed speak beautifully, but if You remain silent they
   cannot inflame the heart. They deliver the message; You lay bare the
   sense. They place before us mysteries, but You unlock their meaning.
   They proclaim commandments; You help us to keep them. They point out
   the way; You give strength for the journey. They work only outwardly;
   You instruct and enlighten our hearts. They water on the outside; You
   give the increase.

   They cry out words; You give understanding to the hearer.

   Let not Moses speak to me, therefore, but You, the Lord my God,
   everlasting truth, speak lest I die and prove barren if I am merely
   given outward advice and am not inflamed within; lest the word heard
   and not kept, known and not loved, believed and not obeyed, rise up in
   judgment against me.

   Speak, therefore, Lord, for Your servant listens. "Thou hast the words
   of eternal life." [31] Speak to me for the comfort of my soul and for
   the amendment of my life, for Your praise, Your glory, and Your
   everlasting honor.

    The Third Chapter

  Listen Humbly to the Words of God. Many Do Not Heed Them


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, hear My words, words of greatest sweetness surpassing all the
   knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of earth. My words are
   spirit and life, and they are not to be weighed by man's understanding.
   They are not to be invoked in vanity but are to be heard in silence,
   and accepted with all humility and with great affection.


    The Disciple

   "Happy is the man whom Thou admonishest, O Lord, and teachest out of
   Thy law, to give him peace from the days of evil," [32] and that he be
   not desolate on earth.


    The Voice of Christ

   I taught the prophets from the beginning, and even to this day I
   continue to speak to all men. But many are hardened. Many are deaf to
   My voice. Most men listen more willingly to the world than to God. They
   are more ready to follow the appetite of their flesh than the good
   pleasure of God. The world, which promises small and passing things, is
   served with great eagerness: I promise great and eternal things and the
   hearts of men grow dull. Who is there that serves and obeys Me in all
   things with as great care as that with which the world and its masters
   are served?

   "Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea speaketh." [33] And if you ask
   why, listen to the cause: for a small gain they travel far; for eternal
   life many will scarcely lift a foot from the ground. They seek a petty
   reward, and sometimes fight shamefully in law courts for a single piece
   of money. They are not afraid to work day and night for a trifle or an
   empty promise. But, for an unchanging good, for a reward beyond
   estimate, for the greatest honor and for glory everlasting, it must be
   said to their shame that men begrudge even the least fatigue. Be
   ashamed, then, lazy and complaining servant, that they should be found
   more eager for perdition than you are for life, that they rejoice more
   in vanity than you in truth.

   Sometimes indeed their expectations fail them, but My promise never
   deceives, nor does it send away empty-handed him who trusts in Me. What
   I have promised I will give. What I have said I will fulfill, if only a
   man remain faithful in My love to the end. I am the rewarder of all the
   good, the strong approver of all who are devoted to Me.

   Write My words in your heart and meditate on them earnestly, for in
   time of temptation they will be very necessary. What you do not
   understand when you read, you will learn in the day of visitation. I am
   wont to visit My elect in two ways--by temptation and by consolation.
   To them I read two lessons daily--one reproving their vices, the other
   exhorting them to progress in virtue. He who has My words and despises
   them has that which shall condemn him on the last day.


    A Prayer for the Grace of Devotion

   O Lord my God, You are all my good. And who am I that I should dare to
   speak to You? I am Your poorest and meanest servant, a vile worm, much
   more poor and contemptible than I know or dare to say. Yet remember me,
   Lord, because I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing. You
   alone are good, just, and holy. You can do all things, You give all
   things, You fill all things: only the sinner do You leave empty-handed.
   Remember Your tender mercies and fill my heart with Your grace, You Who
   will not allow Your works to be in vain. How can I bear this life of
   misery unless You comfort me with Your mercy and grace? Do not turn
   Your face from me. Do not delay Your visitation. Do not withdraw Your
   consolation, lest in Your sight my soul become as desert land. Teach
   me, Lord, to do Your will. Teach me to live worthily and humbly in Your
   sight, for You are my wisdom Who know me truly, and Who knew me even
   before the world was made and before I was born into it.

    The Fourth Chapter

  We Must Walk Before God in Humility and Truth


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, walk before Me in truth, and seek Me always in the simplicity
   of your heart. He who walks before Me in truth shall be defended from
   the attacks of evil, and the truth shall free him from seducers and
   from the slanders of wicked men. For if the truth has made you free,
   then you shall be free indeed, and you shall not care for the vain
   words of men.


    The Disciple

   O Lord, it is true. I ask that it be with me as You say. Let your truth
   teach me. Let it guard me, and keep me safe to the end. Let it free me
   from all evil affection and badly ordered love, and I shall walk with
   You in great freedom of heart.


    The Voice of Christ

   I shall teach you those things which are right and pleasing to Me.
   Consider your sins with great displeasure and sorrow, and never think
   yourself to be someone because of your good works. You are truly a
   sinner. You are subject to many passions and entangled in them. Of
   yourself you always tend to nothing. You fall quickly, are quickly
   overcome, quickly troubled, and quickly undone. You have nothing in
   which you can glory, but you have many things for which you should
   think yourself vile, for you are much weaker than you can comprehend.
   Hence, let none of the things you do seem great to you. Let nothing
   seem important or precious or desirable except that which is
   everlasting. Let the eternal truth please you above all things, and let
   your extreme unworthiness always displease you. Fear nothing, abhor
   nothing, and fly nothing as you do your own vices and sins; these
   should be more unpleasant for you than any material losses.

   Some men walk before Me without sincerity. Led on by a certain
   curiosity and arrogance, they wish to know My secrets and to understand
   the high things of God, to the neglect of themselves and their own
   salvation. Through their own pride and curiosity, and because I am
   against them, such men often fall into great temptations and sins.

   Fear the judgments of God! Dread the wrath of the Almighty! Do not
   discuss the works of the Most High, but examine your sins--in what
   serious things you have offended and how many good things you have
   neglected.

   Some carry their devotion only in books, some in pictures, some in
   outward signs and figures. Some have Me on their lips when there is
   little of Me in their hearts. Others, indeed, with enlightened
   understanding and purified affections, constantly long for everlasting
   things; they are unwilling to hear of earthly affairs and only with
   reluctance do they serve the necessities of nature. These sense what
   the Spirit of truth speaks within them: for He teaches them to despise
   earthly things and to love those of heaven, to neglect the world, and
   each day and night to desire heaven.

    The Fifth Chapter

  The Wonderful Effect of Divine Love


    The Disciple

   I BLESS You, O heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for
   having condescended to remember me, a poor creature. Thanks to You, O
   Father of mercies, God of all consolation, Who with Your comfort
   sometimes refresh me, who am not worthy of it. I bless You always and
   glorify You with Your only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit, the
   Paraclete, forever and ever.

   Ah, Lord God, my holy Lover, when You come into my heart, all that is
   within me will rejoice. You are my glory and the exultation of my
   heart. You are my hope and refuge in the day of my tribulation. But
   because my love is as yet weak and my virtue imperfect, I must be
   strengthened and comforted by You. Visit me often, therefore, and teach
   me Your holy discipline. Free me from evil passions and cleanse my
   heart of all disorderly affection so that, healed and purified within,
   I may be fit to love, strong to suffer, and firm to persevere.

   Love is an excellent thing, a very great blessing, indeed. It makes
   every difficulty easy, and bears all wrongs with equanimity. For it
   bears a burden without being weighted and renders sweet all that is
   bitter. The noble love of Jesus spurs to great deeds and excites
   longing for that which is more perfect. Love tends upward; it will not
   be held down by anything low. Love wishes to be free and estranged from
   all worldly affections, lest its inward sight be obstructed, lest it be
   entangled in any temporal interest and overcome by adversity.

   Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger or higher or wider;
   nothing is more pleasant, nothing fuller, and nothing better in heaven
   or on earth, for love is born of God and cannot rest except in God, Who
   is above all created things.

   One who is in love flies, runs, and rejoices; he is free, not bound. He
   gives all for all and possesses all in all, because he rests in the one
   sovereign Good, Who is above all things, and from Whom every good flows
   and proceeds. He does not look to the gift but turns himself above all
   gifts to the Giver.

   Love often knows no limits but overflows all bounds. Love feels no
   burden, thinks nothing of troubles, attempts more than it is able, and
   does not plead impossibility, because it believes that it may and can
   do all things. For this reason, it is able to do all, performing and
   effecting much where he who does not love fails and falls.

   Love is watchful. Sleeping, it does not slumber. Wearied, it is not
   tired. Pressed, it is not straitened. Alarmed, it is not confused, but
   like a living flame, a burning torch, it forces its way upward and
   passes unharmed through every obstacle.

   If a man loves, he will know the sound of this voice. For this warm
   affection of soul is a loud voice crying in the ears of God, and it
   says: "My God, my love, You are all mine and I am all Yours. Give me an
   increase of love, that I may learn to taste with the inward lips of my
   heart how sweet it is to love, how sweet to be dissolved in love and
   bathe in it. Let me be rapt in love. Let me rise above self in great
   fervor and wonder. Let me sing the hymn of love, and let me follow You,
   my Love, to the heights. Let my soul exhaust itself in praising You,
   rejoicing out of love. Let me love You more than myself, and let me not
   love myself except for Your sake. In You let me love all those who
   truly love You, as the law of love, which shines forth from You,
   commands."

   Love is swift, sincere, kind, pleasant, and delightful. Love is strong,
   patient and faithful, prudent, long-suffering, and manly. Love is never
   self-seeking, for in whatever a person seeks himself there he falls
   from love. Love is circumspect, humble, and upright. It is neither soft
   nor light, nor intent upon vain things. It is sober and chaste, firm
   and quiet, guarded in all the senses. Love is subject and obedient to
   superiors. It is mean and contemptible in its own eyes, devoted and
   thankful to God; always trusting and hoping in Him even when He is
   distasteful to it, for there is no living in love without sorrow. He
   who is not ready to suffer all things and to stand resigned to the will
   of the Beloved is not worthy to be called a lover. A lover must embrace
   willingly all that is difficult and bitter for the sake of the Beloved,
   and he should not turn away from Him because of adversities.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Sixth Chapter

  The Proving of a True Lover


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, you are not yet a brave and wise lover.


    The Disciple

   Why, Lord?


    The Voice of Christ

   Because, on account of a slight difficulty you give up what you have
   undertaken and are too eager to seek consolation.

   The brave lover stands firm in temptations and pays no heed to the
   crafty persuasions of the enemy. As I please him in prosperity, so in
   adversity I am not displeasing to him. The wise lover regards not so
   much the gift of Him Who loves as the love of Him Who gives. He regards
   the affection of the Giver rather than the value of the gift, and sets
   his Beloved above all gifts. The noble lover does not rest in the gift
   but in Me Who am above every gift.

   All is not lost, then, if you sometimes feel less devout than you wish
   toward Me or My saints. That good and sweet feeling which you sometimes
   have is the effect of present grace and a certain foretaste of your
   heavenly home. You must not lean upon it too much, because it comes and
   goes. But to fight against evil thoughts which attack you is a sign of
   virtue and great merit. Do not, therefore, let strange fantasies
   disturb you, no matter what they concern. Hold strongly to your
   resolution and keep a right intention toward God.

   It is not an illusion that you are sometimes rapt in ecstasy and then
   quickly returned to the usual follies of your heart. For these are
   evils which you suffer rather than commit; and so long as they
   displease you and you struggle against them, it is a matter of merit
   and not a loss.

   You must know that the old enemy tries by all means in his power to
   hinder your desire for good and to turn you from every devotional
   practice, especially from the veneration of the saints, from devout
   meditation on My passion, and from your firm purpose of advancing in
   virtue. He suggests many evil thoughts that he may cause you weariness
   and horror, and thus draw you away from prayer and holy reading. A
   humble confession displeases him and, if he could, he would make you
   omit Holy Communion.

   Do not believe him or heed him, even though he often sets traps to
   deceive you. When he suggests evil, unclean things, accuse him. Say to
   him: "Away, unclean spirit! Shame, miserable creature! You are but
   filth to bring such things to my ears. Begone, most wretched seducer!
   You shall have no part in me, for Jesus will be my strength, and you
   shall be confounded. I would rather die and suffer all torments than
   consent to you. Be still! Be silent! Though you bring many troubles
   upon me I will have none of you. The Lord is my light, my salvation.
   Whom shall I fear? Though armies unite against me, my heart will not
   fear, for the Lord is my Helper, my Redeemer."

   Fight like a good soldier and if you sometimes fall through weakness,
   rise again with greater strength than before, trusting in My most
   abundant grace. But beware of vain complacency and pride. For many are
   led into error through these faults and sometimes fall into almost
   perpetual blindness. Let the fall of these, who proudly presume on
   self, be a warning to you and a constant incentive to humility.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Seventh Chapter

  Grace Must Be Hidden Under the Mantle of Humility


    The Voice of Christ

   IT IS better and safer for you to conceal the grace of devotion, not to
   be elated by it, not to speak or think much of it, and instead to
   humble yourself and fear lest it is being given to one unworthy of it.
   Do not cling too closely to this affection, for it may quickly be
   changed to its opposite. When you are in grace, think how miserable and
   needy you are without it. Your progress in spiritual life does not
   consist in having the grace of consolation, but in enduring its
   withdrawal with humility, resignation, and patience, so that you
   neither become listless in prayer nor neglect your other duties in the
   least; but on the contrary do what you can do as well as you know how,
   and do not neglect yourself completely because of your dryness or
   anxiety of mind.

   There are many, indeed, who immediately become impatient and lazy when
   things do not go well with them. The way of man, however, does not
   always lie in his own power. It is God's prerogative to give grace and
   to console when He wishes, as much as He wishes, and whom He wishes, as
   it shall please Him and no more.

   Some careless persons, misusing the grace of devotion, have destroyed
   themselves because they wished to do more than they were able. They
   failed to take account of their own weakness, and followed the desire
   of their heart rather than the judgment of their reason. Then, because
   they presumed to greater things than pleased God they quickly lost His
   grace. They who had built their homes in heaven became helpless, vile
   outcasts, humbled and impoverished, that they might learn not to fly
   with their own wings but to trust in Mine.

   They who are still new and inexperienced in the way of the Lord may
   easily be deceived and overthrown unless they guide themselves by the
   advice of discreet persons. But if they wish to follow their own
   notions rather than to trust in others who are more experienced, they
   will be in danger of a sorry end, at least if they are unwilling to be
   drawn from their vanity. Seldom do they who are wise in their own
   conceits bear humbly the guidance of others. Yet a little knowledge
   humbly and meekly pursued is better than great treasures of learning
   sought in vain complacency. It is better for you to have little than to
   have much which may become the source of pride.

   He who gives himself up entirely to enjoyment acts very unwisely, for
   he forgets his former helplessness and that chastened fear of the Lord
   which dreads to lose a proffered grace. Nor is he very brave or wise
   who becomes too despondent in times of adversity and difficulty and
   thinks less confidently of Me than he should. He who wishes to be too
   secure in time of peace will often become too dejected and fearful in
   time of trial.

   If you were wise enough to remain always humble and small in your own
   eyes, and to restrain and rule your spirit well, you would not fall so
   quickly into danger and offense.

   When a spirit of fervor is enkindled within you, you may well meditate
   on how you will feel when the fervor leaves. Then, when this happens,
   remember that the light which I have withdrawn for a time as a warning
   to you and for My own glory may again return. Such trials are often
   more beneficial than if you had things always as you wish. For a man's
   merits are not measured by many visions or consolations, or by
   knowledge of the Scriptures, or by his being in a higher position than
   others, but by the truth of his humility, by his capacity for divine
   charity, by his constancy in seeking purely and entirely the honor of
   God, by his disregard and positive contempt of self, and more, by
   preferring to be despised and humiliated rather than honored by others.

    The Eighth Chapter

  Self-Abasement in the Sight of God


    The Disciple

   I WILL speak to my Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. If I consider
   myself anything more than this, behold You stand against me, and my
   sins bear witness to the truth which I cannot contradict. If I abase
   myself, however, if I humble myself to nothingness, if I shrink from
   all self-esteem and account myself as the dust which I am, Your grace
   will favor me, Your light will enshroud my heart, and all self-esteem,
   no matter how little, will sink in the depths of my nothingness to
   perish forever.

   It is there You show me to myself--what I am, what I have been, and
   what I am coming to; for I am nothing and I did not know it. Left to
   myself, I am nothing but total weakness. But if You look upon me for an
   instant, I am at once made strong and filled with new joy. Great wonder
   it is that I, who of my own weight always sink to the depths, am so
   suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by You.

   It is Your love that does this, graciously upholding me, supporting me
   in so many necessities, guarding me from so many grave dangers, and
   snatching me, as I may truly say, from evils without number. Indeed, by
   loving myself badly I lost myself; by seeking only You and by truly
   loving You I have found both myself and You, and by that love I have
   reduced myself more profoundly to nothing. For You, O sweetest Lord,
   deal with me above all my merits and above all that I dare to hope or
   ask.

   May You be blessed, my God, for although I am unworthy of any benefits,
   yet Your nobility and infinite goodness never cease to do good even for
   those who are ungrateful and far from You. Convert us to You, that we
   may be thankful, humble, and devout, for You are our salvation, our
   courage, and our strength.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Ninth Chapter

  All Things should be Referred to God as their Last End


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, I must be your supreme and last end, if you truly desire to
   be blessed. With this intention your affections, which are too often
   perversely inclined to self and to creatures, will be purified. For if
   you seek yourself in anything, you immediately fail interiorly and
   become dry of heart.

   Refer all things principally to Me, therefore, for it is I Who have
   given them all. Consider each thing as flowing from the highest good,
   and therefore to Me, as to their highest source, must all things be
   brought back.

   From Me the small and the great, the poor and the rich draw the water
   of life as from a living fountain, and they who serve Me willingly and
   freely shall receive grace upon grace. He who wishes to glory in things
   apart from Me, however, or to delight in some good as his own, shall
   not be grounded in true joy or gladdened in his heart, but shall be
   burdened and distressed in many ways. Hence you ought not to attribute
   any good to yourself or ascribe virtue to any man, but give all to God
   without Whom man has nothing.

   I have given all things. I will that all be returned to Me again, and I
   exact most strictly a return of thanks. This is the truth by which
   vainglory is put to flight.

   Where heavenly grace and true charity enter in, there neither envy nor
   narrowness of heart nor self-love will have place. Divine love conquers
   all and enlarges the powers of the soul.

   If you are truly wise, you will rejoice only in Me, because no one is
   good except God alone, Who is to be praised above all things and above
   all to be blessed.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Tenth Chapter

  To Despise the World and Serve God is Sweet


    The Disciple

   NOW again I will speak, Lord, and will not be silent. I will speak to
   the hearing of my God, my Lord, and my King Who is in heaven. How
   great, O Lord, is the multitude of Your mercies which You have stored
   up for those who love You. But what are You to those who love You? What
   are You to those who serve You with their whole heart?

   Truly beyond the power of words is the sweetness of contemplation You
   give to those who love You. To me You have shown the sweetness of Your
   charity, especially in having made me when I did not exist, in having
   brought me back to serve You when I had gone far astray from You, in
   having commanded me to love You.

   O Fountain of unceasing love, what shall I say of You? How can I forget
   You, Who have been pleased to remember me even after I had wasted away
   and perished? You have shown mercy to Your servant beyond all hope, and
   have exhibited grace and friendship beyond his deserving.

   What return shall I make to You for this grace? For it is not given
   every man to forsake all things, to renounce the world, and undertake
   the religious life. Is it anything great that I should serve You Whom
   every creature is bound to serve? It should not seem much to me;
   instead it should appear great and wonderful that You condescend to
   receive into Your service one who is so poor and unworthy. Behold, all
   things are Yours, even those which I have and by which I serve You.
   Behold, heaven and earth which You created for the service of man,
   stand ready, and each day they do whatever You command. But even this
   is little, for You have appointed angels also to minister to man--yea
   more than all this--You Yourself have condescended to serve man and
   have promised to give him Yourself.

   What return shall I make for all these thousands of benefits? Would
   that I could serve You all the days of my life! Would that for but one
   day I could serve You worthily! Truly You are worthy of all service,
   all honor, and everlasting praise. Truly You are my Lord, and I am Your
   poor servant, bound to serve You with all my powers, praising You
   without ever becoming weary. I wish to do this--this is my desire. Do
   You supply whatever is wanting in me.

   It is a great honor, a great glory to serve You and to despise all
   things for Your sake. They who give themselves gladly to Your most holy
   service will possess great grace. They who cast aside all carnal
   delights for Your love will find the most sweet consolation of the Holy
   Ghost. They who enter upon the narrow way for Your name and cast aside
   all worldly care will attain great freedom of mind.

   O sweet and joyful service of God, which makes man truly free and holy!
   O sacred state of religious bondage which makes man equal to the
   angels, pleasing to God, terrible to the demons, and worthy of the
   commendation of all the faithful! O service to be embraced and always
   desired, in which the highest good is offered and joy is won which
   shall remain forever!

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Eleventh Chapter

  The Longings of our Hearts Must Be Examined And Moderated


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, it is necessary for you to learn many things which you have
   not yet learned well.


    The Disciple

   What are they, Lord?


    The Voice of Christ

   That you conform your desires entirely according to My good pleasure,
   and be not a lover of self but an earnest doer of My will. Desires very
   often inflame you and drive you madly on, but consider whether you act
   for My honor, or for your own advantage. If I am the cause, you will be
   well content with whatever I ordain. If, on the other hand, any
   self-seeking lurk in you, it troubles you and weighs you down. Take
   care, then, that you do not rely too much on preconceived desire that
   has no reference to Me, lest you repent later on and be displeased with
   what at first pleased you and which you desired as being for the best.
   Not every desire which seems good should be followed immediately, nor,
   on the other hand, should every contrary affection be at once rejected.

   It is sometimes well to use a little restraint even in good desires and
   inclinations, lest through too much eagerness you bring upon yourself
   distraction of mind; lest through your lack of discipline you create
   scandal for others; or lest you be suddenly upset and fall because of
   resistance from others. Sometimes, however, you must use violence and
   resist your sensual appetite bravely. You must pay no attention to what
   the flesh does or does not desire, taking pains that it be subjected,
   even by force, to the spirit. And it should be chastised and forced to
   remain in subjection until it is prepared for anything and is taught to
   be satisfied with little, to take pleasure in simple things, and not to
   murmur against inconveniences.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twelfth Chapter

  Acquiring Patience in the Fight Against Concupiscence


    The Disciple

   PATIENCE, O Lord God, is very necessary for me, I see, because there
   are many adversities in this life. No matter what plans I make for my
   own peace, my life cannot be free from struggle and sorrow.

    The Voice of Christ

   My child, you are right, yet My wish is not that you seek that peace
   which is free from temptations or meets with no opposition, but rather
   that you consider yourself as having found peace when you have been
   tormented with many tribulations and tried with many adversities.

   If you say that you cannot suffer much, how will you endure the fire of
   purgatory? Of two evils, the lesser is always to be chosen. Therefore,
   in order that you may escape the everlasting punishments to come, try
   to bear present evils patiently for the sake of God.

   Do you think that men of the world have no suffering, or perhaps but
   little? Ask even those who enjoy the most delights and you will learn
   otherwise. "But," you will say, "they enjoy many pleasures and follow
   their own wishes; therefore they do not feel their troubles very much."
   Granted that they do have whatever they wish, how long do you think it
   will last? Behold, they who prosper in the world shall perish as smoke,
   and there shall be no memory of their past joys. Even in this life they
   do not find rest in these pleasures without bitterness, weariness, and
   fear. For they often receive the penalty of sorrow from the very thing
   whence they believe their happiness comes. And it is just. Since they
   seek and follow after pleasures without reason, they should not enjoy
   them without shame and bitterness.

   How brief, how false, how unreasonable and shameful all these pleasures
   are! Yet in their drunken blindness men do not understand this, but
   like brute beasts incur death of soul for the miserly enjoyment of a
   corruptible life.

   Therefore, My child, do not pursue your lusts, but turn away from your
   own will. "Seek thy pleasure in the Lord and He will give thee thy
   heart's desires." [34] If you wish to be truly delighted and more
   abundantly comforted by Me, behold, in contempt of all worldly things
   and in the cutting off of all base pleasures shall your blessing be,
   and great consolation shall be given you. Further, the more you
   withdraw yourself from any solace of creatures, the sweeter and
   stronger comfort will you find in Me.

   At first you will not gain these blessings without sadness and toil and
   conflict. Habit already formed will resist you, but it shall be
   overcome by a better habit. The flesh will murmur against you, but it
   will be bridled by fervor of spirit. The old serpent will sting and
   trouble you, but prayer will put him to flight and by steadfast, useful
   toil the way will be closed to him.

    The Thirteenth Chapter

  The Obedience of One Humbly Subject to the Example of Jesus Christ


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, he who attempts to escape obeying withdraws himself from
   grace. Likewise he who seeks private benefits for himself loses those
   which are common to all. He who does not submit himself freely and
   willingly to his superior, shows that his flesh is not yet perfectly
   obedient but that it often rebels and murmurs against him.

   Learn quickly, then, to submit yourself to your superior if you wish to
   conquer your own flesh. For the exterior enemy is more quickly overcome
   if the inner man is not laid waste. There is no more troublesome, no
   worse enemy of the soul than you yourself, if you are not in harmony
   with the spirit. It is absolutely necessary that you conceive a true
   contempt for yourself if you wish to be victorious over flesh and
   blood.

   Because you still love yourself too inordinately, you are afraid to
   resign yourself wholly to the will of others. Is it such a great matter
   if you, who are but dust and nothingness, subject yourself to man for
   the sake of God, when I, the All-Powerful, the Most High, Who created
   all things out of nothing, humbly subjected Myself to man for your
   sake? I became the most humble and the lowest of all men that you might
   overcome your pride with My humility.

   Learn to obey, you who are but dust! Learn to humble yourself, you who
   are but earth and clay, and bow down under the foot of every man! Learn
   to break your own will, to submit to all subjection! Be zealous against
   yourself! Allow no pride to dwell in you, but prove yourself so humble
   and lowly that all may walk over you and trample upon you as dust in
   the streets!

   What have you, vain man, to complain of? What answer can you make, vile
   sinner, to those who accuse you, you who have so often offended God and
   so many times deserved hell? But My eye has spared you because your
   soul was precious in My sight, so that you might know My love and
   always be thankful for My benefits, so that you might give yourself
   continually to true subjection and humility, and might patiently endure
   contempt.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fourteenth Chapter

  Consider the Hidden Judgments of God Lest You Become Proud of Your Own Good
  Deeds


    The Disciple

   YOU thunder forth Your judgments over me, Lord. You shake all my bones
   with fear and trembling, and my soul is very much afraid. I stand in
   awe as I consider that the heavens are not pure in Your sight. If You
   found wickedness in the angels and did not spare them, what will become
   of me? Stars have fallen from heaven, and I--I who am but dust--how can
   I be presumptuous? They whose deeds seemed worthy of praise have fallen
   into the depths, and I have seen those who ate the bread of angels
   delighting themselves with the husks of swine.

   There is no holiness, then, if You withdraw Your hand, Lord. There is
   no wisdom if You cease to guide, no courage if You cease to defend. No
   chastity is secure if You do not guard it. Our vigilance avails nothing
   if Your holy watchfulness does not protect us. Left to ourselves we
   sink and perish, but visited by You we are lifted up and live. We are
   truly unstable, but You make us strong. We grow lukewarm, but You
   inflame us.

   Oh, how humbly and lowly should I consider myself! How very little
   should I esteem anything that seems good in me! How profoundly should I
   submit to Your unfathomable judgments, Lord, where I find myself to be
   but nothing!

   O immeasurable weight! O impassable sea, where I find myself to be
   nothing but bare nothingness! Where, then, is glory's hiding place?
   Where can there be any trust in my own virtue? All vainglory is
   swallowed up in the depths of Your judgments upon me.

   What is all flesh in Your sight? Shall the clay glory against Him that
   formed it? How can he whose heart is truly subject to God be lifted up
   by vainglory? The whole world will not make him proud whom truth has
   subjected to itself. Nor shall he who has placed all his hope in God be
   moved by the tongues of flatterers. For behold, even they who speak are
   nothing; they will pass away with the sound of their words, but the
   truth of the Lord remains forever.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifteenth Chapter

  How One Should Feel and Speak on Every Desirable Thing


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, this is the way you must speak on every occasion: "Lord, if
   it be pleasing to You, so be it. If it be to Your honor, Lord, be it
   done in Your name. Lord, if You see that it is expedient and profitable
   for me, then grant that I may use it to Your honor. But if You know
   that it will be harmful to me, and of no good benefit to the welfare of
   my soul, then take this desire away from me."

   Not every desire is from the Holy Spirit, even though it may seem right
   and good. It is difficult to be certain whether it is a good spirit or
   a bad one that prompts one to this or that, and even to know whether
   you are being moved by your own spirit. Many who seemed at first to be
   led by a good spirit have been deceived in the end.

   Whatever the mind sees as good, ask and desire in fear of God and
   humility of heart. Above all, commit the whole matter to Me with true
   resignation, and say: "Lord, You know what is better for me; let this
   be done or that be done as You please. Grant what You will, as much as
   You will, when You will. Do with me as You know best, as will most
   please You, and will be for Your greater honor. Place me where You will
   and deal with me freely in all things. I am in Your hand; turn me about
   whichever way You will. Behold, I am Your servant, ready to obey in all
   things. Not for myself do I desire to live, but for You--would that I
   could do this worthily and perfectly!"

    A Prayer that the Will of God Be Done

   Grant me Your grace, O most merciful Jesus, that it may be with me, and
   work with me, and remain with me to the very end. Grant that I may
   always desire and will that which is most acceptable and pleasing to
   You. Let Your will be mine. Let my will always follow Yours and agree
   perfectly with it. Let my will be one with Yours in willing and in not
   willing, and let me be unable to will or not will anything but what You
   will or do not will. Grant that I may die to all things in this world,
   and for Your sake love to be despised and unknown in this life. Give me
   above all desires the desire to rest in You, and in You let my heart
   have peace. You are true peace of heart. You alone are its rest.
   Without You all things are difficult and troubled. In this peace, the
   selfsame that is in You, the Most High, the everlasting Good, I will
   sleep and take my rest. Amen.

    The Sixteenth Chapter

  True Comfort Is to Be Sought in God Alone


    The Disciple

   WHATEVER I can desire or imagine for my own comfort I look for not here
   but hereafter. For if I alone should have all the world's comforts and
   could enjoy all its delights, it is certain that they could not long
   endure. Therefore, my soul, you cannot enjoy full consolation or
   perfect delight except in God, the Consoler of the poor and the Helper
   of the humble. Wait a little, my soul, wait for the divine promise and
   you will have an abundance of all good things in heaven. If you desire
   these present things too much, you will lose those which are
   everlasting and heavenly. Use temporal things but desire eternal
   things. You cannot be satisfied with any temporal goods because you
   were not created to enjoy them.

   Even if you possessed all created things you could not be happy and
   blessed; for in God, Who created all these things, your whole
   blessedness and happiness consists--not indeed such happiness as is
   seen and praised by lovers of the world, but such as that for which the
   good and faithful servants of Christ wait, and of which the spiritual
   and pure of heart, whose conversation is in heaven, sometime have a
   foretaste.

   Vain and brief is all human consolation. But that which is received
   inwardly from the Truth is blessed and true. The devout man carries his
   Consoler, Jesus, everywhere with him, and he says to Him: "Be with me,
   Lord Jesus, in every place and at all times. Let this be my
   consolation, to be willing to forego all human comforting. And if Your
   consolation be wanting to me, let Your will and just trial of me be my
   greatest comfort. For You will not always be angry, nor will You
   threaten forever."

    The Seventeenth Chapter

  All Our Care is to Be Placed in God


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, allow me to do what I will with you. I know what is best for
   you. You think as a man; you feel in many things as human affection
   persuades.


    The Disciple

   Lord, what You say is true. Your care for me is greater than all the
   care I can take of myself. For he who does not cast all his care upon
   You stands very unsafely. If only my will remain right and firm toward
   You, Lord, do with me whatever pleases You. For whatever You shall do
   with me can only be good.

   If You wish me to be in darkness, I shall bless You. And if You wish me
   to be in light, again I shall bless You. If You stoop down to comfort
   me, I shall bless You, and if You wish me to be afflicted, I shall
   bless You forever.


    The Voice of Christ

   My child, this is the disposition which you should have if you wish to
   walk with Me. You should be as ready to suffer as to enjoy. You should
   as willingly be destitute and poor as rich and satisfied.


    The Disciple

   O Lord, I shall suffer willingly for Your sake whatever You wish to
   send me. I am ready to accept from Your hand both good and evil alike,
   the sweet and the bitter together, sorrow with joy; and for all that
   happens to me I am grateful. Keep me from all sin and I will fear
   neither death nor hell. Do not cast me out forever nor blot me out of
   the Book of Life, and whatever tribulation befalls will not harm me.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Eighteenth Chapter

  Temporal Sufferings Should Be Borne Patiently, After the Example of Christ


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, I came down from heaven for your salvation and took upon
   Myself your miseries, not out of necessity but out of love, that you
   might learn to be patient and bear the sufferings of this life without
   repining. From the moment of My birth to My death on the cross,
   suffering did not leave Me. I suffered great want of temporal goods.
   Often I heard many complaints against Me. Disgrace and reviling I bore
   with patience. For My blessings I received ingratitude, for My miracles
   blasphemies, and for My teaching scorn.


    The Disciple

   O Lord, because You were patient in life, especially in fulfilling the
   design of the Father, it is fitting that I, a most miserable sinner,
   should live patiently according to Your will, and, as long as You shall
   wish, bear the burden of this corruptible body for the welfare of my
   soul. For though this present life seems burdensome, yet by Your grace
   it becomes meritorious, and it is made brighter and more endurable for
   the weak by Your example and the pathways of the saints. But it has
   also more consolation than formerly under the old law when the gates of
   heaven were closed, when the way thereto seemed darker than now, and
   when so few cared to seek the eternal kingdom. The just, the elect,
   could not enter heaven before Your sufferings and sacred death had paid
   the debt.

   Oh, what great thanks I owe You, Who have shown me and all the faithful
   the good and right way to Your everlasting kingdom! Your life is our
   way and in Your holy patience we come nearer to You Who are our crown.
   Had You not gone before and taught us, who would have cared to follow?
   Alas, how many would have remained far behind, had they not before
   their eyes Your holy example! Behold, even we who have heard of Your
   many miracles and teachings are still lukewarm; what would happen if we
   did not have such light by which to follow You?


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Nineteenth Chapter

  True Patience in Suffering


    The Voice of Christ

   WHAT are you saying, My child? Think of My suffering and that of the
   saints, and cease complaining. You have not yet resisted to the
   shedding of blood. What you suffer is very little compared with the
   great things they suffered who were so strongly tempted, so severely
   troubled, so tried and tormented in many ways. Well may you remember,
   therefore, the very painful woes of others, that you may bear your own
   little ones the more easily. And if they do not seem so small to you,
   examine if perhaps your impatience is not the cause of their apparent
   greatness; and whether they are great or small, try to bear them all
   patiently. The better you dispose yourself to suffer, the more wisely
   you act and the greater is the reward promised you. Thus you will
   suffer more easily if your mind and habits are diligently trained to
   it.

   Do not say: "I cannot bear this from such a man, nor should I suffer
   things of this kind, for he has done me a great wrong. He has accused
   me of many things of which I never thought. However, from someone else
   I will gladly suffer as much as I think I should."

   Such a thought is foolish, for it does not consider the virtue of
   patience or the One Who will reward it, but rather weighs the person
   and the offense committed. The man who will suffer only as much as
   seems good to him, who will accept suffering only from those from whom
   he is pleased to accept it, is not truly patient. For the truly patient
   man does not consider from whom the suffering comes, whether from a
   superior, an equal, or an inferior, whether from a good and holy person
   or from a perverse and unworthy one; but no matter how great an
   adversity befalls him, no matter how often it comes or from whom it
   comes, he accepts it gratefully from the hand of God, and counts it a
   great gain. For with God nothing that is suffered for His sake, no
   matter how small, can pass without reward. Be prepared for the fight,
   then, if you wish to gain the victory. Without struggle you cannot
   obtain the crown of patience, and if you refuse to suffer you are
   refusing the crown. But if you desire to be crowned, fight bravely and
   bear up patiently. Without labor there is no rest, and without
   fighting, no victory.


    The Disciple

   O Lord, let that which seems naturally impossible to me become possible
   through Your grace. You know that I can suffer very little, and that I
   am quickly discouraged when any small adversity arises. Let the torment
   of tribulation suffered for Your name be pleasant and desirable to me,
   since to suffer and be troubled for Your sake is very beneficial for my
   soul.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twentieth Chapter

  Confessing Our Weakness in the Miseries of Life


    The Disciple

   I WILL bring witness against myself to my injustice, and to You, O
   Lord, I will confess my weakness.

   Often it is a small thing that makes me downcast and sad. I propose to
   act bravely, but when even a small temptation comes I find myself in
   great straits. Sometimes it is the merest trifle which gives rise to
   grievous temptations. When I think myself somewhat safe and when I am
   not expecting it, I frequently find myself almost overcome by a slight
   wind. Look, therefore, Lord, at my lowliness and frailty which You know
   so well. Have mercy on me and snatch me out of the mire that I may not
   be caught in it and may not remain forever utterly despondent.

   That I am so prone to fall and so weak in resisting my passions
   oppresses me frequently and confounds me in Your sight. While I do not
   fully consent to them, still their assault is very troublesome and
   grievous to me, and it wearies me exceedingly thus to live in daily
   strife. Yet from the fact that abominable fancies rush in upon me much
   more easily than they leave, my weakness becomes clear to me.

   Oh that You, most mighty God of Israel, zealous Lover of faithful
   souls, would consider the labor and sorrow of Your servant, and assist
   him in all his undertakings! Strengthen me with heavenly courage lest
   the outer man, the miserable flesh, against which I shall be obliged to
   fight so long as I draw a breath in this wretched life and which is not
   yet subjected to the spirit, prevail and dominate me.

   Alas! What sort of life is this, from which troubles and miseries are
   never absent, where all things are full of snares and enemies? For when
   one trouble or temptation leaves, another comes. Indeed, even while the
   first conflict is still raging, many others begin unexpectedly. How is
   it possible to love a life that has such great bitterness, that is
   subject to so many calamities and miseries? Indeed, how can it even be
   called life when it begets so many deaths and plagues? And yet, it is
   loved, and many seek their delight in it.

   Many persons often blame the world for being false and vain, yet do not
   readily give it up because the desires of the flesh have such great
   power. Some things draw them to love the world, others make them
   despise it. The lust of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, and the
   pride of life lead to love, while the pains and miseries, which are the
   just consequences of those things, beget hatred and weariness of the
   world.

   Vicious pleasure overcomes the soul that is given to the world. She
   thinks that there are delights beneath these thorns, because she has
   never seen or tasted the sweetness of God or the internal delight of
   virtue. They, on the other hand, who entirely despise the world and
   seek to live for God under the rule of holy discipline, are not
   ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to those who truly renounce
   the world. They see clearly how gravely the world errs, and in how many
   ways it deceives.

    The Twenty-first Chapter

  Above All Goods and All Gifts We Must Rest in God


    The Disciple

   ABOVE all things and in all things, O my soul, rest always in God, for
   He is the everlasting rest of the saints.

   Grant, most sweet and loving Jesus, that I may seek my repose in You
   above every creature; above all health and beauty; above every honor
   and glory; every power and dignity; above all knowledge and cleverness,
   all riches and arts, all joy and gladness; above all fame and praise,
   all sweetness and consolation; above every hope and promise, every
   merit and desire; above all the gifts and favors that You can give or
   pour down upon me; above all the joy and exultation that the mind can
   receive and feel; and finally, above the angels and archangels and all
   the heavenly host; above all things visible and invisible; and may I
   seek my repose in You above everything that is not You, my God.

   For You, O Lord my God, are above all things the best. You alone are
   most high, You alone most powerful. You alone are most sufficient and
   most satisfying, You alone most sweet and consoling. You alone are most
   beautiful and loving, You alone most noble and glorious above all
   things. In You is every perfection that has been or ever will be.
   Therefore, whatever You give me besides Yourself, whatever You reveal
   to me concerning Yourself, and whatever You promise, is too small and
   insufficient when I do not see and fully enjoy You alone. For my heart
   cannot rest or be fully content until, rising above all gifts and every
   created thing, it rests in You. [35]

   Who, O most beloved Spouse, Jesus Christ, most pure Lover, Lord of all
   creation, who shall give me the wings of true liberty that I may fly to
   rest in You? When shall freedom be fully given me to see how sweet You
   are, O Lord, my God? When shall I recollect myself entirely in You, so
   that because of Your love I may feel, not myself, but You alone above
   all sense and measure, in a manner known to none? But now I often
   lament and grieve over my unhappiness, for many evils befall me in this
   vale of miseries, often disturbing me, making me sad and overshadowing
   me, often hindering and distracting me, alluring and entangling me so
   that I neither have free access to You nor enjoy the sweet embraces
   which are ever ready for blessed souls. Let my sighs and the manifold
   desolation here on earth move You.

   O Jesus, Splendor of eternal glory, Consolation of the pilgrim soul,
   with You my lips utter no sound and to You my silence speaks. How long
   will my Lord delay His coming? Let Him come to His poor servant and
   make him happy. Let Him put forth His hand and take this miserable
   creature from his anguish. Come, O come, for without You there will be
   no happy day or hour, because You are my happiness and without You my
   table is empty. I am wretched, as it were imprisoned and weighted down
   with fetters, until You fill me with the light of Your presence,
   restore me to liberty, and show me a friendly countenance. Let others
   seek instead of You whatever they will, but nothing pleases me or will
   please me but You, my God, my Hope, my everlasting Salvation. I will
   not be silent, I will not cease praying until Your grace returns to me
   and You speak inwardly to me, saying: "Behold, I am here. Lo, I have
   come to you because you have called Me. Your tears and the desire of
   your soul, your humility and contrition of heart have inclined Me and
   brought Me to you."

   Lord, I have called You, and have desired You, and have been ready to
   spurn all things for Your sake. For You first spurred me on to seek
   You. May You be blessed, therefore, O Lord, for having shown this
   goodness to Your servant according to the multitude of Your mercies.

   What more is there for Your servant to say to You unless, with his
   iniquity and vileness always in mind, he humbles himself before You?
   Nothing among all the wonders of heaven and earth is like to You. Your
   works are exceedingly good, Your judgments true, and Your providence
   rules the whole universe. May You be praised and glorified, therefore,
   O Wisdom of the Father. Let my lips and my soul and all created things
   unite to praise and bless You.

    The Twenty-Second Chapter

  Remember the Innumerable Gifts of God


    The Disciple

   OPEN my heart, O Lord, to Your law and teach me to walk in the way of
   Your commandments. Let me understand Your will. Let me remember Your
   blessings--all of them and each single one of them--with great
   reverence and care so that henceforth I may return worthy thanks for
   them. I know that I am unable to give due thanks for even the least of
   Your gifts. I am unworthy of the benefits You have given me, and when I
   consider Your generosity my spirit faints away before its greatness.
   All that we have of soul and body, whatever we possess interiorly or
   exteriorly, by nature or by grace, are Your gifts and they proclaim
   Your goodness and mercy from which we have received all good things.

   If one receives more and another less, yet all are Yours and without
   You nothing can be received. He who receives greater things cannot
   glory in his own merit or consider himself above others or behave
   insolently toward those who receive less. He who attributes less to
   himself and is the more humble and devout in returning thanks is indeed
   the greater and the better, while he who considers himself lower than
   all men and judges himself to be the least worthy, is the more fit to
   receive the greater blessing.

   He, on the other hand, who has received fewer gifts should not be sad
   or impatient or envious of the richer man. Instead he should turn his
   mind to You and offer You the greatest praise because You give so
   bountifully, so freely and willingly, without regard to persons. All
   things come from You; therefore, You are to be praised in all things.
   You know what is good for each of us; and why one should receive less
   and another more is not for us to judge, but for You Who have marked
   every man's merits.

   Therefore, O Lord God, I consider it a great blessing not to have many
   things which human judgment holds praiseworthy and glorious, for one
   who realizes his own poverty and vileness should not be sad or downcast
   at it, but rather consoled and happy because You, O God, have chosen
   the poor, the humble, and the despised in this world to be Your friends
   and servants. The truth of this is witnessed by Your Apostles, whom You
   made princes over all the world. Yet they lived in this world without
   complaining, so humble and simple, so free from malice and deceit, that
   they were happy even to suffer reproach for Your name and to embrace
   with great affection that which the world abhors.

   A man who loves You and recognizes Your benefits, therefore, should be
   gladdened by nothing so much as by Your will, by the good pleasure of
   Your eternal decree. With this he should be so contented and consoled
   that he would wish to be the least as others wish to be the greatest;
   that he would be as peaceful and satisfied in the last place as in the
   first, and as willing to be despised, unknown and forgotten, as to be
   honored by others and to have more fame than they. He should prefer
   Your will and the love of Your honor to all else, and it should comfort
   him more than all the benefits which have been, or will be, given him.

    The Twenty-Third Chapter

  Four Things Which Bring Great Peace


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, I will teach you now the way of peace and true liberty.

   Seek, child, to do the will of others rather than your own.

   Always choose to have less rather than more.

   Look always for the last place and seek to be beneath all others.

   Always wish and pray that the will of God be fully carried out in you.

   Behold, such will enter into the realm of peace and rest.


    The Disciple

   O Lord, this brief discourse of Yours contains much perfection. It is
   short in words but full of meaning and abounding in fruit. Certainly if
   I could only keep it faithfully, I should not be so easily disturbed.
   For as often as I find myself troubled and dejected, I find that I have
   departed from this teaching. But You Who can do all things, and Who
   always love what is for my soul's welfare, give me increase of grace
   that I may keep Your words and accomplish my salvation.


    A Prayer Against Bad Thoughts

   O Lord my God, be not far from me. O my God, hasten to help me, for
   varied thoughts and great fears have risen up within me, afflicting my
   soul. How shall I escape them unharmed? How shall I dispel them?

   "I will go before you," says the Lord, "and will humble the great ones
   of earth. I will open the doors of the prison, and will reveal to you
   hidden secrets."

   Do as You say, Lord, and let all evil thoughts fly from Your face. This
   is my hope and my only comfort--to fly to You in all tribulation, to
   confide in You, and to call on You from the depths of my heart and to
   await patiently for Your consolation.


    A Prayer for Enlightening the Mind

   Enlighten me, good Jesus, with the brightness of internal light, and
   take away all darkness from the habitation of my heart. Restrain my
   wandering thoughts and suppress the temptations which attack me so
   violently. Fight strongly for me, and vanquish these evil beasts--the
   alluring desires of the flesh--so that peace may come through Your
   power and the fullness of Your praise resound in the holy courts, which
   is a pure conscience. Command the winds and the tempests; say to the
   sea: "Be still," and to the north wind, "Do not blow," and there will
   be a great calm.

   Send forth Your light and Your truth to shine on the earth, for I am as
   earth, empty and formless until You illumine me. Pour out Your grace
   from above. Shower my heart with heavenly dew. Open the springs of
   devotion to water the earth, that it may produce the best of good
   fruits. Lift up my heart pressed down by the weight of sins, and direct
   all my desires to heavenly things, that having tasted the sweetness of
   supernal happiness, I may find no pleasure in thinking of earthly
   things.

   Snatch me up and deliver me from all the passing comfort of creatures,
   for no created thing can fully quiet and satisfy my desires. Join me to
   Yourself in an inseparable bond of love; because You alone can satisfy
   him who loves You, and without You all things are worthless.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twenty-Fourth Chapter

  Avoiding Curious Inquiry About the Lives of Others


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not be curious. Do not trouble yourself with idle cares.
   What matters this or that to you? Follow Me. What is it to you if a man
   is such and such, if another does or says this or that? You will not
   have to answer for others, but you will have to give an account of
   yourself. Why, then, do you meddle in their affairs?

   Behold, I know all men. I see everything that is done under the sun,
   and I know how matters stand with each--what is in his mind and what in
   his heart and the end to which his intention is directed. Commit all
   things to Me, therefore, and keep yourself in good peace. Let him who
   is disturbed be as restless as he will. Whatever he has said or done
   will fall upon himself, for he cannot deceive Me.

   Do not be anxious for the shadow of a great name, for the close
   friendship of many, or for the particular affection of men. These
   things cause distraction and cast great darkness about the heart. I
   would willingly speak My word and reveal My secrets to you, if you
   would watch diligently for My coming and open your heart to Me. Be
   prudent, then. Watch in prayer, and in all things humble yourself.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twenty-Fifth Chapter

  The Basis of Firm Peace of Heart and True Progress


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, I have said: "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto
   you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you." [36]

   All men desire peace but all do not care for the things that go to make
   true peace. My peace is with the humble and meek of heart: your peace
   will be in much patience. If you hear Me and follow My voice, you will
   be able to enjoy much peace.


    The Disciple

   What, then, shall I do, Lord?


    The Voice of Christ

   Watch yourself in all things, in what you do and what you say. Direct
   your every intention toward pleasing Me alone, and desire nothing
   outside of Me. Do not be rash in judging the deeds and words of others,
   and do not entangle yourself in affairs that are not your own. Thus, it
   will come about that you will be disturbed little and seldom.

   Yet, never to experience any disturbance or to suffer any hurt in heart
   or body does not belong to this present life, but rather to the state
   of eternal rest. Do not think, therefore, that you have found true
   peace if you feel no depression, or that all is well because you suffer
   no opposition. Do not think that all is perfect if everything happens
   just as you wish. And do not imagine yourself great or consider
   yourself especially beloved if you are filled with great devotion and
   sweetness. For the true lover of virtue is not known by these things,
   nor do the progress and perfection of a man consist in them.


    The Disciple

   In what do they consist, Lord?


    The Voice of Christ

   They consist in offering yourself with all your heart to the divine
   will, not seeking what is yours either in small matters or great ones,
   either in temporal or eternal things, so that you will preserve
   equanimity and give thanks in both prosperity and adversity, seeing all
   things in their proper light.

   If you become so brave and long-suffering in hope that you can prepare
   your heart to suffer still more even when all inward consolation is
   withdrawn, and if you do not justify yourself as though you ought not
   be made to suffer such great things, but acknowledge Me to be just in
   all My works and praise My holy name--then you will walk in the true
   and right path of peace, then you may have sure hope of seeing My face
   again in joy. If you attain to complete contempt of self, then know
   that you will enjoy an abundance of peace, as much as is possible in
   this earthly life.

    The Twenty-Sixth Chapter

  The Excellence of a Free Mind, Gained Through Prayer Rather Than By Study


    The Disciple

   IT IS the mark of a perfect man, Lord, never to let his mind relax in
   attention to heavenly things, and to pass through many cares as though
   he had none; not as an indolent man does, but having by the certain
   prerogative of a free mind no disorderly affection for any created
   being.

   Keep me, I beg You, most merciful God, from the cares of this life,
   lest I be too much entangled in them. Keep me from many necessities of
   the body, lest I be ensnared by pleasure. Keep me from all darkness of
   mind, lest I be broken by troubles and overcome. I do not ask
   deliverance from those things which worldly vanity desires so eagerly,
   but from those miseries which, by the common curse of humankind,
   oppress the soul of Your servant in punishment and keep him from
   entering into the liberty of spirit as often as he would.

   My God, Sweetness beyond words, make bitter all the carnal comfort that
   draws me from love of the eternal and lures me to its evil self by the
   sight of some delightful good in the present. Let it not overcome me,
   my God. Let not flesh and blood conquer me. Let not the world and its
   brief glory deceive me, nor the devil trip me by his craftiness. Give
   me courage to resist, patience to endure, and constancy to persevere.
   Give me the soothing unction of Your spirit rather than all the
   consolations of the world, and in place of carnal love, infuse into me
   the love of Your name.

   Behold, eating, drinking, clothing, and other necessities that sustain
   the body are burdensome to the fervent soul. Grant me the grace to use
   such comforts temperately and not to become entangled in too great a
   desire for them. It is not lawful to cast them aside completely, for
   nature must be sustained, but Your holy law forbids us to demand
   superfluous things and things that are simply for pleasure, else the
   flesh would rebel against the spirit. In these matters, I beg, let Your
   hand guide and direct me, so that I may not overstep the law in any
   way.

    The Twenty-Seventh Chapter

  Self-Love is the Greatest Hindrance to the Highest Good


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, you should give all for all, and in no way belong to
   yourself. You must know that self-love is more harmful to you than
   anything else in the world. In proportion to the love and affection you
   have for a thing, it will cling to you more or less. If your love is
   pure, simple, and well ordered, you will not be a slave to anything. Do
   not covet what you may not have. Do not possess anything that can
   hinder you or rob you of freedom.

   It is strange that you do not commit yourself to Me with your whole
   heart, together with all that you can desire or possess. Why are you
   consumed with foolish sorrow? Why are you wearied with unnecessary
   care? Be resigned to My will and you will suffer no loss.

   If you seek this or that, if you wish to be in this place or that
   place, to have more ease and pleasure, you will never rest or be free
   from care, for some defect is found in everything and everywhere
   someone will vex you. To obtain and multiply earthly goods, then, will
   not help you, but to despise them and root them out of your heart will
   aid. This, understand, is true not only of money and wealth, but also
   of ambition for honor and desire for empty praise, all of which will
   pass away with this world.

   The place matters little if the spirit of fervor is not there; nor will
   peace be lasting if it is sought from the outside; if your heart has no
   true foundation, that is, if you are not founded in Me, you may change,
   but you will not better yourself. For when occasion arises and is
   accepted, you will find that from which you fled and worse.


    A Prayer for Cleansing the Heart and Obtaining Heavenly Wisdom

   Strengthen me by the grace of Your holy spirit, O God. Give me the
   power to be strengthened inwardly and to empty my heart of all vain
   care and anxiety, so that I may not be drawn away by many desires,
   whether for precious things or mean ones. Let me look upon everything
   as passing, and upon myself as soon to pass away with them, because
   there is nothing lasting under the sun, where all is vanity and
   affliction of spirit. How wise is he who thinks thus!

   Give me, Lord, heavenly wisdom to learn above all else to seek and find
   You, to enjoy and love You more than anything, and to consider other
   things as they are, as Your wisdom has ordered them. Grant me prudence
   to avoid the flatterer and to bear patiently with him who disagrees
   with me. For it is great wisdom not to be moved by the sound of words,
   nor to give ear to the wicked, flattering siren. Then, I shall walk
   safely in the way I have begun.

  Strength Against Slander


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not take it to heart if some people think badly of you and
   say unpleasant things about you. You ought to think worse things of
   yourself and to believe that no one is weaker than yourself. Moreover,
   if you walk in the spirit you will pay little heed to fleeting words.
   It is no small prudence to remain silent in evil times, to turn
   inwardly to Me, and not to be disturbed by human opinions. Do not let
   your peace depend on the words of men. Their thinking well or badly of
   you does not make you different from what you are. Where are true peace
   and glory? Are they not in Me? He who neither cares to please men nor
   fears to displease them will enjoy great peace, for all unrest and
   distraction of the senses arise out of disorderly love and vain fear.

  How We Must Call Upon and Bless the Lord When Trouble Presses


    The Disciple

   BLESSED be Your name forever, O Lord, Who have willed that this
   temptation and trouble come upon me. I cannot escape it, yet I must fly
   to You that You may help me and turn it to my good. Now I am troubled,
   Lord, and my heart is not at rest, for I am greatly afflicted by this
   present suffering.

   Beloved Father, what shall I say? I am straitened in harsh ways. Save
   me from this hour to which, however, I am come that You may be
   glorified when I am deeply humbled and freed by You. May it please You,
   then, to deliver me, Lord, for what can I, poor wretch that I am, do or
   where can I go without You? Give me patience, Lord, even now. Help me,
   my God, and I will not be afraid however much I may be distressed.

   But here, in the midst of these troubles, what shall I say? Your will
   be done, Lord. I have richly deserved to be troubled and distressed.
   But I must bear it. Would that I could do so patiently, until the storm
   passes and calm returns! Yet Your almighty hand can take this
   temptation from me, or lighten its attack so that I do not altogether
   sink beneath it, as You, my God, my Mercy, have very often done for me
   before. And the more difficult my plight, the easier for You is this
   change of the right hand of the Most High.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirtieth Chapter

  The Quest of Divine Help and Confidence in Regaining Grace


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, I am the Lord Who gives strength in the day of trouble. Come
   to Me when all is not well with you. Your tardiness in turning to
   prayer is the greatest obstacle to heavenly consolation, for before you
   pray earnestly to Me you first seek many comforts and take pleasure in
   outward things. Thus, all things are of little profit to you until you
   realize that I am the one Who saves those who trust in Me, and that
   outside of Me there is no worth-while help, or any useful counsel or
   lasting remedy.

   But now, after the tempest, take courage, grow strong once more in the
   light of My mercies; for I am near, says the Lord, to restore all
   things not only to the full but with abundance and above measure. Is
   anything difficult for Me? Or shall I be as one who promises and does
   not act? Where is your faith? Stand firm and persevere. Be a man of
   endurance and courage, and consolation will come to you in due time.
   Wait for Me; wait--and I will come to heal you.

   It is only a temptation that troubles you, a vain fear that terrifies
   you.

   Of what use is anxiety about the future? Does it bring you anything but
   trouble upon trouble? Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. It is
   foolish and useless to be either grieved or happy about future things
   which perhaps may never happen. But it is human to be deluded by such
   imaginations, and the sign of a weak soul to be led on by suggestions
   of the enemy. For he does not care whether he overcomes you by love of
   the present or fear of the future.

   Let not your heart be troubled, therefore, nor let it be afraid.
   Believe in Me and trust in My mercy. When you think you are far from
   Me, then often I am very near you. When you judge that almost all is
   lost, then very often you are in the way of gaining great merit.

   All is not lost when things go contrary to your wishes. You ought not
   judge according to present feelings, nor give in to any trouble
   whenever it comes, or take it as though all hope of escape were lost.
   And do not consider yourself forsaken if I send some temporary
   hardship, or withdraw the consolation you desire. For this is the way
   to the kingdom of heaven, and without doubt it is better for you and
   the rest of My servants to be tried in adversities than to have all
   things as you wish. I know your secret thoughts, and I know that it is
   profitable for your salvation to be left sometimes in despondency lest
   perhaps you be puffed up by success and fancy yourself to be what you
   are not.

   What I have given, I can take away and restore when it pleases Me. What
   I give remains Mine, and thus when I take it away I take nothing that
   is yours, for every good gift and every perfect gift is Mine.

   If I send you trouble and adversity, do not fret or let your heart be
   downcast. I can raise you quickly up again and turn all your sorrow
   into joy. I am no less just and worthy of great praise when I deal with
   you in this way.

   If you think aright and view things in their true light, you should
   never be so dejected and saddened by adversity, but rather rejoice and
   give thanks, considering it a matter of special joy that I afflict you
   with sorrow and do not spare you. "As the Father hath loved Me, so also
   I love you," I said to My disciples, and I certainly did not send them
   out to temporal joys but rather to great struggles, not to honors but
   to contempt, not to idleness, but to labors, not to rest but to bring
   forth much fruit in patience. Do you, My child, remember these words.

    The Thirty-First Chapter

  To Find the Creator, Forsake All Creatures


    The Disciple


   O LORD, I am in sore need still of greater grace if I am to arrive at
   the point where no man and no created thing can be an obstacle to me.
   For as long as anything holds me back, I cannot freely fly to You. He
   that said "Oh that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and
   be at rest!" [37] desired to fly freely to You. Who is more at rest
   than he who aims at nothing but God? And who more free than the man who
   desires nothing on earth?

   It is well, then, to pass over all creation, perfectly to abandon self,
   and to see in ecstasy of mind that You, the Creator of all, have no
   likeness among all Your creatures, and that unless a man be freed from
   all creatures, he cannot attend freely to the Divine. The reason why so
   few contemplative persons are found, is that so few know how to
   separate themselves entirely from what is transitory and created.

   For this, indeed, great grace is needed, grace that will raise the soul
   and lift it up above itself. Unless a man be elevated in spirit, free
   from all creatures, and completely united to God, all his knowledge and
   possessions are of little moment. He who considers anything great
   except the one, immense, eternal good will long be little and lie
   groveling on the earth. Whatever is not God is nothing and must be
   accounted as nothing.

   There is great difference between the wisdom of an enlightened and
   devout man and the learning of a well-read and brilliant scholar, for
   the knowledge which flows down from divine sources is much nobler than
   that laboriously acquired by human industry.

   Many there are who desire contemplation, but who do not care to do the
   things which contemplation requires. It is also a great obstacle to be
   satisfied with externals and sensible things, and to have so little of
   perfect mortification. I know not what it is, or by what spirit we are
   led, or to what we pretend--we who wish to be called spiritual--that we
   spend so much labor and even more anxiety on things that are transitory
   and mean, while we seldom or never advert with full consciousness to
   our interior concerns.

   Alas, after very little recollection we falter, not weighing our deeds
   by strict examination. We pay no attention to where our affections lie,
   nor do we deplore the fact that our actions are impure.

   Remember that because all flesh had corrupted its course, the great
   deluge followed. Since, then, our interior affection is corrupt, it
   must be that the action which follows from it, the index as it were of
   our lack of inward strength, is also corrupt. Out of a pure heart come
   the fruits of a good life.

   People are wont to ask how much a man has done, but they think little
   of the virtue with which he acts. They ask: Is he strong? rich?
   handsome? a good writer? a good singer? or a good worker? They say
   little, however, about how poor he is in spirit, how patient and meek,
   how devout and spiritual. Nature looks to his outward appearance; grace
   turns to his inward being. The one often errs, the other trusts in God
   and is not deceived.

    The Thirty-Second Chapter

  Self-Denial and the Renunciation of Evil Appetites


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, you can never be perfectly free unless you completely
   renounce self, for all who seek their own interest and who love
   themselves are bound in fetters. They are unsettled by covetousness and
   curiosity, always searching for ease and not for the things of Christ,
   often devising and framing that which will not last, for anything that
   is not of God will fail completely.

   Hold to this short and perfect advice, therefore: give up your desires
   and you will find rest. Think upon it in your heart, and when you have
   put it into practice you will understand all things.


    The Disciple

   But this, Lord, is not the work of one day, nor is it mere child's
   play; indeed, in this brief sentence is included all the perfection of
   holy persons.


    The Voice of Christ

   My child, you should not turn away or be downcast when you hear the way
   of the perfect. Rather you ought to be spurred on the more toward their
   sublime heights, or at least be moved to seek perfection.

   I would this were the case with you--that you had progressed to the
   point where you no longer loved self but simply awaited My bidding and
   his whom I have placed as father over you. Then you would please Me
   very much, and your whole life would pass in peace and joy. But you
   have yet many things which you must give up, and unless you resign them
   entirely to Me you will not obtain that which you ask.

   "I counsel thee to buy of me gold, fire-tried, that thou mayest be made
   rich" [38] --rich in heavenly wisdom which treads underfoot all that is
   low. Put aside earthly wisdom, all human self-complacency.

   I have said: exchange what is precious and valued among men for that
   which is considered contemptible. For true heavenly wisdom--not to
   think highly of self and not to seek glory on earth--does indeed seem
   mean and small and is well-nigh forgotten, as many men praise it with
   their mouths but shy far away from it in their lives. Yet this heavenly
   wisdom is a pearl of great price, which is hidden from many.

    The Thirty-Third Chapter

  Restlessness of Soul--Directing Our Final Intention Toward God


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not trust in your present feeling, for it will soon give
   way to another. As long as you live you will be subject to
   changeableness in spite of yourself. You will become merry at one time
   and sad at another, now peaceful but again disturbed, at one moment
   devout and the next indevout, sometimes diligent while at other times
   lazy, now grave and again flippant.

   But the man who is wise and whose spirit is well instructed stands
   superior to these changes. He pays no attention to what he feels in
   himself or from what quarter the wind of fickleness blows, so long as
   the whole intention of his mind is conducive to his proper and desired
   end. For thus he can stand undivided, unchanged, and unshaken, with the
   singleness of his intention directed unwaveringly toward Me, even in
   the midst of so many changing events. And the purer this singleness of
   intention is, with so much the more constancy does he pass through many
   storms.

   But in many ways the eye of pure intention grows dim, because it is
   attracted to any delightful thing that it meets. Indeed, it is rare to
   find one who is entirely free from all taint of self-seeking. The Jews
   of old, for example, came to Bethany to Martha and Mary, not for Jesus'
   sake alone, but in order to see Lazarus.

   The eye of your intention, therefore, must be cleansed so that it is
   single and right. It must be directed toward Me, despite all the
   objects which may interfere.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

  God is Sweet Above All Things and in All Things to Those Who Love Him


    The Disciple

   BEHOLD, my God and my all! What more do I wish for; what greater
   happiness can I desire? O sweet and delicious word! But sweet only to
   him who loves it, and not to the world or the things that are in the
   world.

   My God and my all! These words are enough for him who understands, and
   for him who loves it is a joy to repeat them often. For when You are
   present, all things are delightful; when You are absent, all things
   become loathsome. It is You Who give a heart tranquillity, great peace
   and festive joy. It is You Who make us think well of all things, and
   praise You in all things. Without You nothing can give pleasure for
   very long, for if it is to be pleasing and tasteful, Your grace and the
   seasoning of Your wisdom must be in it. What is there that can
   displease him whose happiness is in You? And, on the contrary, what can
   satisfy him whose delight is not in You?

   The wise men of the world, the men who lust for the flesh, are wanting
   in Your wisdom, because in the world is found the utmost vanity, and in
   the flesh is death. But they who follow You by disdaining worldly
   things and mortifying the flesh are known to be truly wise, for they
   are transported from vanity to truth, from flesh to spirit. By such as
   these God is relished, and whatever good is found in creatures they
   turn to praise of the Creator. But great--yes, very great, indeed--is
   the difference between delight in the Creator and in the creature, in
   eternity and in time, in Light uncreated and in the light that is
   reflected.

   O Light eternal, surpassing all created brightness, flash forth the
   lightning from above and enlighten the inmost recesses of my heart.
   Cleanse, cheer, enlighten, and vivify my spirit with all its powers,
   that it may cleave to You in ecstasies of joy. Oh, when will that happy
   and wished-for hour come, that You may fill me with Your presence and
   become all in all to me? So long as this is not given me, my joy will
   not be complete.

   The old man, alas, yet lives within me. He has not yet been entirely
   crucified; he is not yet entirely dead. He still lusts strongly against
   the spirit, and he will not leave the kingdom of my soul in peace. But
   You, Who can command the power of the sea and calm the tumult of its
   waves, arise and help me. Scatter the nations that delight in war;
   crush them in Your sight. Show forth I beg, Your wonderful works and
   let Your right hand be glorified, because for me there is no other hope
   or refuge except in You, O Lord, my God.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

  There is No Security from Temptation in This Life


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, in this life you are never safe, and as long as you live the
   weapons of the spirit will ever be necessary to you. You dwell among
   enemies. You are subject to attack from the right and the left. If,
   therefore, you do not guard yourself from every quarter with the shield
   of patience, you will not remain long unscathed.

   Moreover, if you do not steadily set your heart on Me, with a firm will
   to suffer everything for My sake, you will not be able to bear the heat
   of this battle or to win the crown of the blessed. You ought,
   therefore, to pass through all these things bravely and to oppose a
   strong hand to whatever stands in your way. For to him who triumphs
   heavenly bread is given, while for him who is too lazy to fight there
   remains much misery.

   If you look for rest in this life, how will you attain to everlasting
   rest? Dispose yourself, then, not for much rest but for great patience.
   Seek true peace, not on earth but in heaven; not in men or in other
   creatures but in God alone. For love of God you should undergo all
   things cheerfully, all labors and sorrows, temptations and trials,
   anxieties, weaknesses, necessities, injuries, slanders, rebukes,
   humiliations, confusions, corrections, and contempt. For these are
   helps to virtue. These are the trials of Christ's recruit. These form
   the heavenly crown. For a little brief labor I will give an everlasting
   crown, and for passing confusion, glory that is eternal.

   Do you think that you will always have spiritual consolations as you
   desire? My saints did not always have them. Instead, they had many
   afflictions, temptations of various kinds, and great desolation. Yet
   they bore them all patiently. They placed their confidence in God
   rather than in themselves, knowing that the sufferings of this life are
   not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to come. And you--do
   you wish to have at once that which others have scarcely obtained after
   many tears and great labors?

   Wait for the Lord, act bravely, and have courage. Do not lose trust. Do
   not turn back but devote your body and soul constantly to God's glory.
   I will reward you most plentifully. I will be with you in every
   tribulation.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirty-Sixth Chapter

  The Vain Judgments of Men


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, trust firmly in the Lord, and do not fear the judgment of men
   when conscience tells you that you are upright and innocent. For it is
   good and blessed to suffer such things, and they will not weigh heavily
   on the humble heart that trusts in God rather than in itself. Many men
   say many things, and therefore little faith is to be put in them.

   Likewise, it is impossible to satisfy all men. Although Paul tried to
   please all in the Lord, and became all things to all men, yet he made
   little of their opinions. He labored abundantly for the edification and
   salvation of others, as much as lay in him and as much as he could, but
   he could not escape being sometimes judged and despised by others.
   Therefore, he committed all to God Who knows all things, and defended
   himself by his patience and humility against the tongues of those who
   spoke unjustly or thought foolish things and lies, or made accusations
   against him. Sometimes, indeed, he did answer them, but only lest his
   silence scandalize the weak.

   Who are you, then, that you should be afraid of mortal man? Today he is
   here, tomorrow he is not seen. Fear God and you will not be afraid of
   the terrors of men. What can anyone do to you by word or injury? He
   hurts himself rather than you, and no matter who he may be he cannot
   escape the judgment of God. Keep God before your eyes, therefore, and
   do not quarrel with peevish words.

   If it seems, then, that you are worsted and that you suffer undeserved
   shame, do not repine over it and do not lessen your crown by
   impatience. Look instead to heaven, to Me, Who have power to deliver
   you from all disgrace and injury, and to render to everyone according
   to his works.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirty-Seventh Chapter

  Pure and Entire Resignation of Self to Obtain Freedom of Heart


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, renounce self and you shall find Me. Give up your own
   self-will, your possessions, and you shall always gain. For once you
   resign yourself irrevocably, greater grace will be given you.


    The Disciple

   How often, Lord, shall I resign myself? And in what shall I forsake
   myself?


    The Voice of Christ

   Always, at every hour, in small matters as well as great--I except
   nothing. In all things I wish you to be stripped of self. How otherwise
   can you be mine or I yours unless you be despoiled of your own will
   both inwardly and outwardly? The sooner you do this the better it will
   be for you, and the more fully and sincerely you do it the more you
   will please Me and the greater gain you will merit.

   Some there are who resign themselves, but with certain reservation;
   they do not trust fully in God and therefore they try to provide for
   themselves. Others, again, at first offer all, but afterward are
   assailed by temptation and return to what they have renounced, thereby
   making no progress in virtue. These will not reach the true liberty of
   a pure heart nor the grace of happy friendship with Me unless they
   first make a full resignation and a daily sacrifice of themselves.
   Without this no fruitful union lasts nor will last.

   I have said to you very often, and now I say again: forsake yourself,
   renounce yourself and you shall enjoy great inward peace. Give all for
   all. Ask nothing, demand nothing in return. Trust purely and without
   hesitation in Me, and you shall possess Me. You will be free of heart
   and darkness will not overwhelm you.

   Strive for this, pray for this, desire this--to be stripped of all
   selfishness and naked to follow the naked Jesus, to die to self and
   live forever for Me. Then all vain imaginations, all wicked
   disturbances and superfluous cares will vanish. Then also immoderate
   fear will leave you and inordinate love will die.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

  The Right Ordering of External Affairs; Recourse to God in Dangers


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, you must strive diligently to be inwardly free, to have
   mastery over yourself everywhere, in every external act and occupation,
   that all things be subject to you and not you to them, that you be the
   master and director of your actions, not a slave or a mere hired
   servant. You should be rather a free man and a true Hebrew, arising to
   the status and freedom of the children of God who stand above present
   things to contemplate those which are eternal; who look upon passing
   affairs with the left eye and upon those of heaven with the right; whom
   temporal things do not so attract that they cling to them, but who
   rather put these things to such proper service as is ordained and
   instituted by God, the great Workmaster, Who leaves nothing unordered
   in His creation.

   If, likewise, in every happening you are not content simply with
   outward appearances, if you do not regard with carnal eyes things which
   you see and hear, but whatever be the affair, enter with Moses into the
   tabernacle to ask advice of the Lord, you will sometimes hear the
   divine answer and return instructed in many things present and to come.
   For Moses always had recourse to the tabernacle for the solution of
   doubts and questions, and fled to prayer for support in dangers and the
   evil deeds of men. So you also should take refuge in the secret chamber
   of your heart, begging earnestly for divine aid.

   For this reason, as we read, Joshua and the children of Israel were
   deceived by the Gibeonites because they did not first seek counsel of
   the Lord, but trusted too much in fair words and hence were deceived by
   false piety.

    The Thirty-Ninth Chapter

  A Man Should Not Be Unduly Solicitous About His Affairs


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, always commit your cause to Me. I will dispose of it rightly
   in good time. Await My ordering of it and it will be to your advantage.


    The Disciple

   Lord, I willingly commit all things to You, for my anxiety can profit
   me little. But I would that I were not so concerned about the future,
   and instead offered myself without hesitation to Your good pleasure.


    The Voice of Christ

   My child, it often happens that a man seeks ardently after something he
   desires and then when he has attained it he begins to think that it is
   not at all desirable; for affections do not remain fixed on the same
   thing, but rather flit from one to another. It is no very small matter,
   therefore, for a man to forsake himself even in things that are very
   small.

   A man's true progress consists in denying himself, and the man who has
   denied himself is truly free and secure. The old enemy, however,
   setting himself against all good, never ceases to tempt them, but day
   and night plots dangerous snares to cast the unwary into the net of
   deceit. "Watch ye and pray," says the Lord, "that ye enter not into
   temptation." [39]

  Man Has No Good in Himself and Can Glory in Nothing


    The Disciple

   LORD, what is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that
   You visit him? What has man deserved that You should give him Your
   grace? What cause have I, Lord, to complain if You desert me, or what
   objection can I have if You do not do what I ask? This I may think and
   say in all truth: "Lord, I am nothing, of myself I have nothing that is
   good; I am lacking in all things, and I am ever tending toward nothing.
   And unless I have Your help and am inwardly strengthened by You, I
   become quite lukewarm and lax."

   But You, Lord, are always the same. You remain forever, always good,
   just, and holy; doing all things rightly, justly, and holily, disposing
   them wisely. I, however, who am more ready to go backward than forward,
   do not remain always in one state, for I change with the seasons. Yet
   my condition quickly improves when it pleases You and when You reach
   forth Your helping hand. For You alone, without human aid, can help me
   and strengthen me so greatly that my heart shall no more change but be
   converted and rest solely in You. Hence, if I knew well how to cast
   aside all earthly consolation, either to attain devotion or because of
   the necessity which, in the absence of human solace, compels me to seek
   You alone, then I could deservedly hope for Your grace and rejoice in
   the gift of new consolation.

   Thanks be to You from Whom all things come, whenever it is well with
   me. In Your sight I am vanity and nothingness, a weak, unstable man. In
   what, therefore, can I glory, and how can I wish to be highly regarded?
   Is it because I am nothing? This, too, is utterly vain. Indeed, the
   greatest vanity is the evil plague of empty self-glory, because it
   draws one away from true glory and robs one of heavenly grace. For when
   a man is pleased with himself he displeases You, when he pants after
   human praise he is deprived of true virtue. But it is true glory and
   holy exultation to glory in You and not in self, to rejoice in Your
   name rather than in one's own virtue, and not to delight in any
   creature except for Your sake.

   Let Your name, not mine, be praised. Let Your work, not mine, be
   magnified. Let Your holy name be blessed, but let no human praise be
   given to me. You are my glory. You are the joy of my heart. In You I
   will glory and rejoice all the day, and for myself I will glory in
   nothing but my infirmities.

   Let the Jews seek the glory that comes from another. I will seek that
   which comes from God alone. All human glory, all temporal honor, all
   worldly position is truly vanity and foolishness compared to Your
   everlasting glory. O my Truth, my Mercy, my God, O Blessed Trinity, to
   You alone be praise and honor, power and glory, throughout all the
   endless ages of ages.

    The Forty-First Chapter

  Contempt for All Earthly Honor


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not take it to heart if you see others honored and
   advanced, while you yourself are despised and humbled. Lift up your
   heart to Me in heaven and the contempt of men on earth will not grieve
   you.

    The Disciple

   Lord, we are blinded and quickly misled by vanity. If I examine myself
   rightly, no injury has ever been done me by any creature; hence I have
   nothing for which to make just complaint to You. But I have sinned
   often and gravely against You; therefore is every creature in arms
   against me. Confusion and contempt should in justice come upon me, but
   to You due praise, honor, and glory. And unless I prepare myself to be
   willingly despised and forsaken by every creature, to be considered
   absolutely nothing, I cannot have interior peace and strength, nor can
   I be enlightened spiritually or completely united with You.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Forty-Second Chapter

  Peace is Not to Be Placed in Men


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, if you place your peace in any creature because of your own
   feeling or for the sake of his company, you will be unsettled and
   entangled. But if you have recourse to the ever-living and abiding
   Truth, you will not grieve if a friend should die or forsake you. Your
   love for your friend should be grounded in Me, and for My sake you
   should love whoever seems to be good and is very dear to you in this
   life. Without Me friendship has no strength and cannot endure. Love
   which I do not bind is neither true nor pure.

   You ought, therefore, to be so dead to such human affections as to wish
   as far as lies within you to be without the fellowship of men. Man
   draws nearer to God in proportion as he withdraws farther from all
   earthly comfort. And he ascends higher to God as he descends lower into
   himself and grows more vile in his own eyes. He who attributes any good
   to himself hinders God's grace from coming into his heart, for the
   grace of the Holy Spirit seeks always the humble heart.

   If you knew how to annihilate yourself completely and empty yourself of
   all created love, then I should overflow in you with great grace. When
   you look to creatures, the sight of the Creator is taken from you.
   Learn, therefore, to conquer yourself in all things for the sake of
   your Maker. Then will you be able to attain to divine knowledge. But
   anything, no matter how small, that is loved and regarded inordinately
   keeps you back from the highest good and corrupts the soul.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Forty-Third Chapter

  Beware Vain and Worldly Knowledge


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not let the fine-sounding and subtle words of men deceive
   you. For the kingdom of heaven consists not in talk but in virtue.
   Attend, rather, to My words which enkindle the heart and enlighten the
   mind, which excite contrition and abound in manifold consolations.
   Never read them for the purpose of appearing more learned or more wise.
   Apply yourself to mortifying your vices, for this will benefit you more
   than your understanding of many difficult questions.

   Though you shall have read and learned many things, it will always be
   necessary for you to return to this one principle: I am He who teaches
   man knowledge, and to the little ones I give a clearer understanding
   than can be taught by man. He to whom I speak will soon be wise and his
   soul will profit. But woe to those who inquire of men about many
   curious things, and care very little about the way they serve Me.

   The time will come when Christ, the Teacher of teachers, the Lord of
   angels, will appear to hear the lessons of all--that is, to examine the
   conscience of everyone. Then He will search Jerusalem with lamps and
   the hidden things of darkness will be brought to light and the arguings
   of men's tongues be silenced.

   I am He Who in one moment so enlightens the humble mind that it
   comprehends more of eternal truth than could be learned by ten years in
   the schools. I teach without noise of words or clash of opinions,
   without ambition for honor or confusion of argument.

   I am He Who teaches man to despise earthly possessions and to loathe
   present things, to ask after the eternal, to hunger for heaven, to fly
   honors and to bear with scandals, to place all hope in Me, to desire
   nothing apart from Me, and to love Me ardently above all things. For a
   certain man by loving Me intimately learned divine truths and spoke
   wonders. He profited more by leaving all things than by studying subtle
   questions.

   To some I speak of common things, to others of special matters. To some
   I appear with sweetness in signs and figures, and to others I appear in
   great light and reveal mysteries. The voice of books is but a single
   voice, yet it does not teach all men alike, because I within them am
   the Teacher and the Truth, the Examiner of hearts, the Understander of
   thoughts, the Promoter of acts, distributing to each as I see fit.

    The Forty-Fourth Chapter

  Do Not Be Concerned About Outward Things


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, there are many matters of which it is well for you to be
   ignorant, and to consider yourself as one who is dead upon the earth
   and to whom the whole world is crucified. There are many things, too,
   which it is well to pass by with a deaf ear, thinking, instead, of what
   is more to your peace. It is more profitable to turn away from things
   which displease you and to leave to every man his own opinion than to
   take part in quarrelsome talk. If you stand well with God and look to
   His judgment, you will more easily bear being worsted.


    The Disciple

   To what have we come, Lord? Behold, we bewail a temporal loss. We labor
   and fret for a small gain, while loss of the soul is forgotten and
   scarcely ever returns to mind. That which is of little or no value
   claims our attention, whereas that which is of highest necessity is
   neglected--all because man gives himself wholly to outward things. And
   unless he withdraws himself quickly, he willingly lies immersed in
   externals.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Forty-Fifth Chapter

  All Men Are Not to Be Believed, for It Is Easy to Err in Speech


    The Disciple

   GRANT me help in my needs, O Lord, for the aid of man is useless. How
   often have I failed to find faithfulness in places where I thought I
   possessed it! And how many times I have found it where I least expected
   it! Vain, therefore, is hope in men, but the salvation of the just is
   in You, O God. Blessed be Your name, O Lord my God, in everything that
   befalls us.

   We are weak and unstable, quickly deceived and changed. Who is the man
   that is able to guard himself with such caution and care as not
   sometimes to fall into deception or perplexity? He who confides in You,
   O Lord, and seeks You with a simple heart does not fall so easily. And
   if some trouble should come upon him, no matter how entangled in it he
   may be, he will be more quickly delivered and comforted by You. For You
   will not forsake him who trusts in You to the very end.

   Rare is the friend who remains faithful through all his friend's
   distress. But You, Lord, and You alone, are entirely faithful in all
   things; other than You, there is none so faithful.

   Oh, how wise is that holy soul [40] who said: "My mind is firmly
   settled and founded in Christ." If that were true of me, human fear
   would not so easily cause me anxiety, nor would the darts of words
   disturb. But who can foresee all things and provide against all evils?
   And if things foreseen have often hurt, can those which are unlooked
   for do otherwise than wound us gravely? Why, indeed, have I not
   provided better for my wretched self? Why, too, have I so easily kept
   faith in others? We are but men, however, nothing more than weak men,
   although we are thought by many to be, and are called, angels.

   In whom shall I put my faith, Lord? In whom but You? You are the truth
   which does not deceive and cannot be deceived. Every man, on the other
   hand, is a liar, weak, unstable, and likely to err, especially in
   words, so that one ought not to be too quick to believe even that which
   seems, on the face of it, to sound true. How wise was Your warning to
   beware of men; that a man's enemies are those of his own household;
   that we should not believe if anyone says: "Behold he is here, or
   behold he is there."

   I have been taught to my own cost, and I hope it has given me greater
   caution, not greater folly. "Beware," they say, "beware and keep to
   yourself what I tell you!" Then while I keep silent, believing that the
   matter is secret, he who asks me to be silent cannot remain silent
   himself, but immediately betrays both me and himself, and goes his way.
   From tales of this kind and from such careless men protect me, O Lord,
   lest I fall into their hands and into their ways. Put in my mouth words
   that are true and steadfast and keep far from me the crafty tongue,
   because what I am not willing to suffer I ought by all means to shun.

   Oh, how good and how peaceful it is to be silent about others, not to
   believe without discrimination all that is said, not easily to report
   it further, to reveal oneself to few, always to seek You as the
   discerner of hearts, and not to be blown away by every wind of words,
   but to wish that all things, within and beyond us, be done according to
   the pleasure of Thy will.

   How conducive it is for the keeping of heavenly grace to fly the gaze
   of men, not to seek abroad things which seem to cause admiration, but
   to follow with utmost diligence those which give fervor and amendment
   of life! How many have been harmed by having their virtue known and
   praised too hastily! And how truly profitable it has been when grace
   remained hidden during this frail life, which is all temptation and
   warfare!

    The Forty-Sixth Chapter

  Trust in God Against Slander


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, stand firm and trust in Me. For what are words but words?
   They fly through the air but hurt not a stone. If you are guilty,
   consider how you would gladly amend. If you are not conscious of any
   fault, think that you wish to bear this for the sake of God. It is
   little enough for you occasionally to endure words, since you are not
   yet strong enough to bear hard blows.

   And why do such small matters pierce you to the heart, unless because
   you are still carnal and pay more heed to men than you ought? You do
   not wish to be reproved for your faults and you seek shelter in excuses
   because you are afraid of being despised. But look into yourself more
   thoroughly and you will learn that the world is still alive in you, in
   a vain desire to please men. For when you shrink from being abased and
   confounded for your failings, it is plain indeed that you are not truly
   humble or truly dead to the world, and that the world is not crucified
   in you.

   Listen to My word, and you will not value ten thousand words of men.
   Behold, if every malicious thing that could possibly be invented were
   uttered against you, what harm could it do if you ignored it all and
   gave it no more thought than you would a blade of grass? Could it so
   much as pluck one hair from your head?

   He who does not keep his heart within him, and who does not have God
   before his eyes is easily moved by a word of disparagement. He who
   trusts in Me, on the other hand, and who has no desire to stand by his
   own judgment, will be free from the fear of men. For I am the judge and
   discerner of all secrets. I know how all things happen. I know who
   causes injury and who suffers it. From Me that word proceeded, and with
   My permission it happened, that out of many hearts thoughts may be
   revealed. I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but I have wished
   beforehand to try them both by secret judgment.

   The testimony of man is often deceiving, but My judgment is true--it
   will stand and not be overthrown. It is hidden from many and made known
   to but a few. Yet it is never mistaken and cannot be mistaken even
   though it does not seem right in the eyes of the unwise.

   To Me, therefore, you ought to come in every decision, not depending on
   your own judgment. For the just man will not be disturbed, no matter
   what may befall him from God. Even if an unjust charge be made against
   him he will not be much troubled. Neither will he exult vainly if
   through others he is justly acquitted. He considers that it is I Who
   search the hearts and inmost thoughts of men, that I do not judge
   according to the face of things or human appearances. For what the
   judgment of men considers praiseworthy is often worthy of blame in My
   sight.


    The Disciple

   O Lord God, just Judge, strong and patient, You Who know the weakness
   and depravity of men, be my strength and all my confidence, for my own
   conscience is not sufficient for me. You know what I do not know, and,
   therefore, I ought to humble myself whenever I am accused and bear it
   meekly. Forgive me, then, in Your mercy for my every failure in this
   regard, and give me once more the grace of greater endurance. Better to
   me is Your abundant mercy in obtaining pardon than the justice which I
   imagine in defending the secrets of my conscience. And though I am not
   conscious to myself of any fault, yet I cannot thereby justify myself,
   because without Your mercy no man living will be justified in Your
   sight.

    The Forty-Seventh Chapter

  Every Trial Must Be Borne for the Sake of Eternal Life


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, do not let the labors which you have taken up for My sake
   break you, and do not let troubles, from whatever source, cast you
   down; but in everything let My promise strengthen and console you. I am
   able to reward you beyond all means and measure.

   You will not labor here long, nor will you always be oppressed by
   sorrows. Wait a little while and you will see a speedy end of evils.
   The hour will come when all labor and trouble shall be no more. All
   that passes away with time is trivial.

   What you do, do well. Work faithfully in My vineyard. I will be your
   reward. Write, read, sing, mourn, keep silence, pray, and bear
   hardships like a man. Eternal life is worth all these and greater
   battles. Peace will come on a day which is known to the Lord, and then
   there shall be no day or night as at present but perpetual light,
   infinite brightness, lasting peace, and safe repose. Then you will not
   say: "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" nor will you
   cry: "Woe is me, because my sojourn is prolonged." For then death will
   be banished, and there will be health unfailing. There will be no
   anxiety then, but blessed joy and sweet, noble companionship.

   If you could see the everlasting crowns of the saints in heaven, and
   the great glory wherein they now rejoice--they who were once considered
   contemptible in this world and, as it were, unworthy of life
   itself--you would certainly humble yourself at once to the very earth,
   and seek to be subject to all rather than to command even one. Nor
   would you desire the pleasant days of this life, but rather be glad to
   suffer for God, considering it your greatest gain to be counted as
   nothing among men.

   Oh, if these things appealed to you and penetrated deeply into your
   heart, how could you dare to complain even once? Ought not all trials
   be borne for the sake of everlasting life? In truth, the loss or gain
   of God's kingdom is no small matter.

   Lift up your countenance to heaven, then. Behold Me, and with Me all My
   saints. They had great trials in this life, but now they rejoice. They
   are consoled. Now they are safe and at rest. And they shall abide with
   Me for all eternity in the kingdom of My Father.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Forty-Eighth Chapter

  The Day of Eternity and the Distresses of This Life


    The Disciple

   O MOST happy mansion of the city above! O most bright day of eternity,
   which night does not darken, but which the highest truth ever
   enlightens! O day, ever joyful and ever secure, which never changes its
   state to the opposite! Oh, that this day shine forth, that all these
   temporal things come to an end! It envelops the saints all resplendent
   with heavenly brightness, but it appears far off as through a glass to
   us wanderers on the earth. The citizens of heaven know how joyful that
   day is, but the exiled sons of Eve mourn that this one is bitter and
   tedious.

   The days of this life are short and evil, full of grief and distress.
   Here man is defiled by many sins, ensnared in many passions, enslaved
   by many fears, and burdened with many cares. He is distracted by many
   curiosities and entangled in many vanities, surrounded by many errors
   and worn by many labors, oppressed by temptations, weakened by
   pleasures, and tortured by want.

   Oh, when will these evils end? When shall I be freed from the miserable
   slavery of vice? When, Lord, shall I think of You alone? When shall I
   fully rejoice in You? When shall I be without hindrance, in true
   liberty, free from every grievance of mind and body? When will there be
   solid peace, undisturbed and secure, inward peace and outward peace,
   peace secured on every side? O good Jesus, when shall I stand to gaze
   upon You? When shall I contemplate the glory of Your kingdom? When will
   You be all in all to me? Oh, when shall I be with You in that kingdom
   of Yours, which You have prepared for Your beloved from all eternity?

   I am left poor and exiled in a hostile land, where every day sees wars
   and very great misfortunes. Console my banishment, assuage my sorrow.
   My whole desire is for You. Whatever solace this world offers is a
   burden to me. I desire to enjoy You intimately, but I cannot attain to
   it. I wish to cling fast to heavenly things, but temporal affairs and
   unmortified passions bear me down. I wish in mind to be above all
   things, but I am forced by the flesh to be unwillingly subject to them.
   Thus, I fight with myself, unhappy that I am, and am become a burden to
   myself, while my spirit seeks to rise upward and my flesh to sink
   downward. Oh, what inward suffering I undergo when I consider heavenly
   things; when I pray, a multitude of carnal thoughts rush upon me!

   O my God, do not remove Yourself far from me, and depart not in anger
   from Your servant. Dart forth Your lightning and disperse them; send
   forth Your arrows and let the phantoms of the enemy be put to flight.
   Draw my senses toward You and make me forget all worldly things. Grant
   me the grace to cast away quickly all vicious imaginings and to scorn
   them. Aid me, O heavenly Truth, that no vanity may move me. Come,
   heavenly Sweetness, and let all impurity fly from before Your face.

   Pardon me also, and deal mercifully with me, as often as I think of
   anything besides You in prayer. For I confess truly that I am
   accustomed to be very much distracted. Very often I am not where bodily
   I stand or sit; rather, I am where my thoughts carry me. Where my
   thoughts are, there am I; and frequently my thoughts are where my love
   is. That which naturally delights, or is by habit pleasing, comes to me
   quickly. Hence You Who are Truth itself, have plainly said: "For where
   your treasure is, there is your heart also." If I love heaven, I think
   willingly of heavenly things. If I love the world, I rejoice at the
   happiness of the world and grieve at its troubles. If I love the flesh,
   I often imagine things that are carnal. If I love the spirit, I delight
   in thinking of spiritual matters. For whatever I love, I am willing to
   speak and hear about.

   Blessed is the man who for Your sake, O Lord, dismisses all creatures,
   does violence to nature, crucifies the desires of the flesh in fervor
   of spirit, so that with serene conscience he can offer You a pure
   prayer and, having excluded all earthly things inwardly and outwardly,
   becomes worthy to enter into the heavenly choirs.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Forty-Ninth Chapter

  The Desire of Eternal Life; the Great Rewards Promised to Those Who Struggle


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, when you feel the desire for everlasting happiness poured out
   upon you from above, and when you long to depart out of the tabernacle
   of the body that you may contemplate My glory without threat of change,
   open wide your heart and receive this holy inspiration with all
   eagerness. Give deepest thanks to the heavenly Goodness which deals
   with you so understandingly, visits you so mercifully, stirs you so
   fervently, and sustains you so powerfully lest under your own weight
   you sink down to earthly things. For you obtain this not by your own
   thought or effort, but simply by the condescension of heavenly grace
   and divine regard. And the purpose of it is that you may advance in
   virtue and in greater humility, that you may prepare yourself for
   future trials, that you may strive to cling to Me with all the
   affection of your heart, and may serve Me with a fervent will.

   My child, often, when the fire is burning the flame does not ascend
   without smoke. Likewise, the desires of some burn toward heavenly
   things, and yet they are not free from temptations of carnal affection.
   Therefore, it is not altogether for the pure honor of God that they act
   when they petition Him so earnestly. Such, too, is often your desire
   which you profess to be so strong. For that which is alloyed with
   self-interest is not pure and perfect.

   Ask, therefore, not for what is pleasing and convenient to yourself,
   but for what is acceptable to Me and is for My honor, because if you
   judge rightly, you ought to prefer and follow My will, not your own
   desire or whatever things you wish.

   I know your longings and I have heard your frequent sighs. Already you
   wish to be in the liberty of the glory of the sons of God. Already you
   desire the delights of the eternal home, the heavenly land that is full
   of joy. But that hour is not yet come. There remains yet another hour,
   a time of war, of labor, and of trial. You long to be filled with the
   highest good, but you cannot attain it now. I am that sovereign Good.
   Await Me, until the kingdom of God shall come.

   You must still be tried on earth, and exercised in many things.
   Consolation will sometimes be given you, but the complete fullness of
   it is not granted. Take courage, therefore, and be strong both to do
   and to suffer what is contrary to nature.

   You must put on the new man. You must be changed into another man. You
   must often do the things you do not wish to do and forego those you do
   wish. What pleases others will succeed; what pleases you will not. The
   words of others will be heard; what you say will be accounted as
   nothing. Others will ask and receive; you will ask and not receive.
   Others will gain great fame among men; about you nothing will be said.
   To others the doing of this or that will be entrusted; you will be
   judged useless. At all this nature will sometimes be sad, and it will
   be a great thing if you bear this sadness in silence. For in these and
   many similar ways the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried,
   to see how far he can deny himself and break himself in all things.

   There is scarcely anything in which you so need to die to self as in
   seeing and suffering things that are against your will, especially when
   things that are commanded seem inconvenient or useless. Then, because
   you are under authority, and dare not resist the higher power, it seems
   hard to submit to the will of another and give up your own opinion
   entirely.

   But consider, my child, the fruit of these labors, how soon they will
   end and how greatly they will be rewarded, and you will not be saddened
   by them, but your patience will receive the strongest consolation. For
   instead of the little will that you now readily give up, you shall
   always have your will in heaven. There, indeed, you shall find all that
   you could desire. There you shall have possession of every good without
   fear of losing it. There shall your will be forever one with Mine. It
   shall desire nothing outside of Me and nothing for itself. There no one
   shall oppose you, no one shall complain of you, no one hinder you, and
   nothing stand in your way. All that you desire will be present there,
   replenishing your affection and satisfying it to the full. There I
   shall render you glory for the reproach you have suffered here; for
   your sorrow I shall give you a garment of praise, and for the lowest
   place a seat of power forever. There the fruit of glory will appear,
   the labor of penance rejoice, and humble subjection be gloriously
   crowned.

   Bow humbly, therefore, under the will of all, and do not heed who said
   this or commanded that. But let it be your special care when something
   is commanded, or even hinted at, whether by a superior or an inferior
   or an equal, that you take it in good part and try honestly to perform
   it. Let one person seek one thing and another something else. Let one
   glory in this, another in that, and both be praised a thousand times
   over. But as for you, rejoice neither in one or the other, but only in
   contempt of yourself and in My pleasure and honor. Let this be your
   wish: That whether in life or in death God may be glorified in you.

    The Fiftieth Chapter

  How a Desolate Person Ought to Commit Himself Into the Hands of God


    The Disciple

   LORD God, Holy Father, may You be blessed now and in eternity. For as
   You will, so is it done; and what You do is good. Let Your servant
   rejoice in You--not in himself or in any other, for You alone are true
   joy. You are my hope and my crown. You, O Lord, are my joy and my
   honor.

   What does Your servant possess that he has not received from You, and
   that without any merit of his own? Yours are all the things which You
   have given, all the things which You have made.

   I am poor and in labors since my youth, and my soul is sorrowful
   sometimes even to the point of tears. At times, also, my spirit is
   troubled because of impending sufferings. I long for the joy of peace.
   Earnestly I beg for the peace of Your children who are fed by You in
   the light of consolation. If You give peace, if You infuse holy joy,
   the soul of Your servant shall be filled with holy song and be devout
   in praising You. But if You withdraw Yourself, as You so very often do,
   he will not be able to follow the way of Your commandments, but will
   rather be obliged to strike his breast and bend the knee, because his
   today is different from yesterday and the day before when Your light
   shone upon his head and he was protected in the shadow of Your wings
   from the temptations rushing upon him.

   Just Father, ever to be praised, the hour is come for Your servant to
   be tried. Beloved Father, it is right that in this hour Your servant
   should suffer something for You. O Father, forever to be honored, the
   hour which You knew from all eternity is at hand, when for a short time
   Your servant should be outwardly oppressed, but inwardly should ever
   live with You.

   Let him be a little slighted, let him be humbled, let him fail in the
   sight of men, let him be afflicted with sufferings and pains, so that
   he may rise again with You in the dawn of the new light and be
   glorified in heaven.

   Holy Father, You have so appointed and wished it. What has happened is
   what You commanded. For this is a favor to Your friend, to suffer and
   be troubled in the world for Your love, no matter how often and by whom
   You permit it to happen to him.

   Nothing happens in the world without Your design and providence, and
   without cause. It is well for me, O Lord, that You have humbled me,
   that I may learn the justice of Your judgments and cast away all
   presumption and haughtiness of heart. It is profitable for me that
   shame has covered my face that I may look to You rather than to men for
   consolation. Hereby I have learned also to fear Your inscrutable
   judgment falling alike upon the just and unjust yet not without equity
   and justice.

   Thanks to You that You have not spared me evils but have bruised me
   with bitter blows, inflicting sorrows, sending distress without and
   within. Under heaven there is none to console me except You, my Lord
   God, the heavenly Physician of souls, Who wound and heal, Who cast down
   to hell and raise up again. Your discipline is upon me and Your very
   rod shall instruct me.

   Behold, beloved Father, I am in Your hands. I bow myself under Your
   correcting chastisement. Strike my back and my neck, that I may bend my
   crookedness to Your will. Make of me a pious and humble follower, as in
   Your goodness You are wont to do, that I may walk according to Your
   every nod. Myself and all that is mine I commit to You to be corrected,
   for it is better to be punished here than hereafter.

   You know all things without exception, and nothing in man's conscience
   is hidden from You. Coming events You know before they happen, and
   there is no need for anyone to teach or admonish You of what is being
   done on earth. You know what will promote my progress, and how much
   tribulation will serve to cleanse away the rust of vice. Deal with me
   according to Your good pleasure and do not despise my sinful life,
   which is known to none so well or so clearly as to You alone.

   Grant me, O Lord, the grace to know what should be known, to praise
   what is most pleasing to You, to esteem that which appears most
   precious to You, and to abhor what is unclean in Your sight.

   Do not allow me to judge according to the light of my bodily eyes, nor
   to give sentence according to the hearing of ignorant men's ears. But
   let me distinguish with true judgment between things visible and
   spiritual, and always seek above all things Your good pleasure. The
   senses of men often err in their judgments, and the lovers of this
   world also err in loving only visible things. How is a man the better
   for being thought greater by men? The deceiver deceives the deceitful,
   the vain man deceives the vain, the blind deceives the blind, the weak
   deceives the weak as often as he extols them, and in truth his foolish
   praise shames them the more. For, as the humble St. Francis says,
   whatever anyone is in Your sight, that he is and nothing more.

    The Fifty-First Chapter

  When We Cannot Attain to the Highest, We Must Practice the Humble Works


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, you cannot always continue in the more fervent desire of
   virtue, or remain in the higher stage of contemplation, but because of
   humanity's sin you must sometimes descend to lower things and bear the
   burden of this corruptible life, albeit unwillingly and wearily. As
   long as you wear a mortal body you will suffer weariness and heaviness
   of heart. You ought, therefore, to bewail in the flesh the burden of
   the flesh which keeps you from giving yourself unceasingly to spiritual
   exercises and divine contemplation.

   In such condition, it is well for you to apply yourself to humble,
   outward works and to refresh yourself in good deeds, to await with
   unshaken confidence My heavenly visitation, patiently to bear your
   exile and dryness of mind until you are again visited by Me and freed
   of all anxieties. For I will cause you to forget your labors and to
   enjoy inward quiet. I will spread before you the open fields of the
   Scriptures, so that with an open heart you may begin to advance in the
   way of My commandments. And you will say: the sufferings of this time
   are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be
   revealed to us.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifty-Second Chapter

  A Man Ought Not to Consider Himself Worthy of Consolation, But Rather
  Deserving of Chastisement


    The Disciple

   LORD, I am not worthy of Your consolation or of any spiritual
   visitation. Therefore, You treat me justly when You leave me poor and
   desolate. For though I could shed a sea of tears, yet I should not be
   worthy of Your consolation. Hence, I deserve only to be scourged and
   punished because I have offended You often and grievously, and have
   sinned greatly in many things. In all justice, therefore, I am not
   worthy of any consolation.

   But You, O gracious and merciful God, Who do not will that Your works
   should perish, deign to console Your servant beyond all his merit and
   above human measure, to show the riches of Your goodness toward the
   vessels of mercy. For Your consolations are not like the words of men.

   What have I done, Lord, that You should confer on me any heavenly
   comfort? I remember that I have done nothing good, but that I have
   always been prone to sin and slow to amend. That is true. I cannot deny
   it. If I said otherwise You would stand against me, and there would be
   no one to defend me. What have I deserved for my sins except hell and
   everlasting fire?

   In truth, I confess that I am deserving of all scorn and contempt.
   Neither is it fitting that I should be remembered among Your devoted
   servants. And although it is hard for me to hear this, yet for truth's
   sake I will allege my sins against myself, so that I may more easily
   deserve to beg Your mercy. What shall I say, guilty as I am and full of
   all confusion? My tongue can say nothing but this alone: "I have
   sinned, O Lord, I have sinned; have mercy on me and pardon me. Suffer
   me a little that I may pour out my grief, before I go to that dark land
   that is covered with the shadow of death."

   What do you especially demand of a guilty and wretched sinner, except
   that he be contrite and humble himself for his sins? In true sorrow and
   humility of heart hope of forgiveness is born, the troubled conscience
   is reconciled, grace is found, man is preserved from the wrath to come,
   and God and the penitent meet with a holy kiss.

   To You, O Lord, humble sorrow for sins is an acceptable sacrifice, a
   sacrifice far sweeter than the perfume of incense. This is also the
   pleasing ointment which You would have poured upon Your sacred feet,
   for a contrite and humble heart You have never despised. Here is a
   place of refuge from the force of the enemy's anger. Here is amended
   and washed away whatever defilement has been contracted elsewhere.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifty-Third Chapter

  God's Grace Is Not Given to the Earthly Minded


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, my grace is precious. It does not allow itself to be mixed
   with external things or with earthly consolations. Cast away all
   obstacles to grace, therefore, if you wish to receive its infusion.

   Seek to retire within yourself. Love to dwell alone with yourself. Seek
   no man's conversation, but rather pour forth devout prayer to God that
   you may keep your mind contrite and your heart pure.

   Consider the whole world as nothing. Prefer attendance upon God to all
   outward occupation, for you cannot attend upon Me and at the same time
   take delight in external things. You must remove yourself from
   acquaintances and from dear friends, and keep your mind free of all
   temporal consolation. Thus the blessed Apostle St. Peter begs the
   faithful of Christ to keep themselves as strangers and pilgrims in the
   world. [41]

   What great confidence at the hour of death shall be his who is not
   attached to this world by any affection. But the sickly soul does not
   know what it is to have a heart thus separated from all things, nor
   does the natural man know the liberty of the spiritual man. Yet, if he
   truly wishes to be spiritual, he must renounce both strangers and
   friends, and must beware of no one more than himself.

   If you completely conquer yourself, you will more easily subdue all
   other things. The perfect victory is to triumph over self. For he who
   holds himself in such subjection that sensuality obeys reason and
   reason obeys Me in all matters, is truly his own conqueror and master
   of the world.

   Now, if you wish to climb to this high position you must begin like a
   man, and lay the ax to the root, in order to tear out and destroy any
   hidden unruly love of self or of earthly goods. From this vice of too
   much self-love comes almost every other vice that must be uprooted. And
   when this evil is vanquished, and brought under control, great peace
   and quiet will follow at once.

   But because few labor to die entirely to self, or tend completely away
   from self, therefore they remain entangled in self, and cannot be
   lifted in spirit above themselves. But he who desires to walk freely
   with Me must mortify all his low and inordinate affections, and must
   not cling with selfish love or desire to any creature.

    The Fifty-Fourth Chapter

  The Different Motions of Nature and Grace


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, pay careful attention to the movements of nature and of
   grace, for they move in very contrary and subtle ways, and can scarcely
   be distinguished by anyone except a man who is spiritual and inwardly
   enlightened. All men, indeed, desire what is good, and strive for what
   is good in their words and deeds. For this reason the appearance of
   good deceives many.

   Nature is crafty and attracts many, ensnaring and deceiving them while
   ever seeking itself. But grace walks in simplicity, turns away from all
   appearance of evil, offers no deceits, and does all purely for God in
   whom she rests as her last end.

   Nature is not willing to die, or to be kept down, or to be overcome.
   Nor will it subdue itself or be made subject. Grace, on the contrary,
   strives for mortification of self. She resists sensuality, seeks to be
   in subjection, longs to be conquered, has no wish to use her own
   liberty, loves to be held under discipline, and does not desire to rule
   over anyone, but wishes rather to live, to stand, and to be always
   under God for Whose sake she is willing to bow humbly to every human
   creature.

   Nature works for its own interest and looks to the profit it can reap
   from another. Grace does not consider what is useful and advantageous
   to herself, but rather what is profitable to many. Nature likes to
   receive honor and reverence, but grace faithfully attributes all honor
   and glory to God. Nature fears shame and contempt, but grace is happy
   to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus. Nature loves ease and
   physical rest. Grace, however, cannot bear to be idle and embraces
   labor willingly. Nature seeks to possess what is rare and beautiful,
   abhorring things that are cheap and coarse. Grace, on the contrary,
   delights in simple, humble things, not despising those that are rough,
   nor refusing to be clothed in old garments.

   Nature has regard for temporal wealth and rejoices in earthly gains. It
   is sad over a loss and irritated by a slight, injurious word. But grace
   looks to eternal things and does not cling to those which are temporal,
   being neither disturbed at loss nor angered by hard words, because she
   has placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nothing is lost.

   Nature is covetous, and receives more willingly than it gives. It loves
   to have its own private possessions. Grace, however, is kind and
   openhearted. Grace shuns private interest, is contented with little,
   and judges it more blessed to give than to receive.

   Nature is inclined toward creatures, toward its own flesh, toward
   vanities, and toward running about. But grace draws near to God and to
   virtue, renounces creatures, hates the desires of the flesh, restrains
   her wanderings and blushes at being seen in public.

   Nature likes to have some external comfort in which it can take sensual
   delight, but grace seeks consolation only in God, to find her delight
   in the highest Good, above all visible things.

   Nature does everything for its own gain and interest. It can do nothing
   without pay and hopes for its good deeds to receive their equal or
   better, or else praise and favor. It is very desirous of having its
   deeds and gifts highly regarded. Grace, however, seeks nothing
   temporal, nor does she ask any recompense but God alone. Of temporal
   necessities she asks no more than will serve to obtain eternity.

   Nature rejoices in many friends and kinsfolk, glories in noble position
   and birth, fawns on the powerful, flatters the rich, and applauds those
   who are like itself. But grace loves even her enemies and is not puffed
   up at having many friends. She does not think highly of either position
   or birth unless there is also virtue there. She favors the poor in
   preference to the rich. She sympathizes with the innocent rather than
   with the powerful. She rejoices with the true man rather than with the
   deceitful, and is always exhorting the good to strive for better gifts,
   to become like the Son of God by practicing the virtues.

   Nature is quick to complain of need and trouble; grace is stanch in
   suffering want.

   Nature turns all things back to self. It fights and argues for self.
   Grace brings all things back to God in Whom they have their source. To
   herself she ascribes no good, nor is she arrogant or presumptuous. She
   is not contentious. She does not prefer her own opinion to the opinion
   of others, but in every matter of sense and thought submits herself to
   eternal wisdom and the divine judgment.

   Nature has a relish for knowing secrets and hearing news. It wishes to
   appear abroad and to have many sense experiences. It wishes to be known
   and to do things for which it will be praised and admired. But grace
   does not care to hear news or curious matters, because all this arises
   from the old corruption of man, since there is nothing new, nothing
   lasting on earth. Grace teaches, therefore, restraint of the senses,
   avoidance of vain self-satisfaction and show, the humble hiding of
   deeds worthy of praise and admiration, and the seeking in every thing
   and in every knowledge the fruit of usefulness, the praise and honor of
   God. She will not have herself or hers exalted, but desires that God
   Who bestows all simply out of love should be blessed in His gifts.

   This grace is a supernatural light, a certain special gift of God, the
   proper mark of the elect and the pledge of everlasting salvation. It
   raises man up from earthly things to love the things of heaven. It
   makes a spiritual man of a carnal one.

   The more, then, nature is held in check and conquered, the more grace
   is given. Every day the interior man is reformed by new visitations
   according to the image of God.

    The Fifty-Fifth Chapter

  The Corruption of Nature and the Efficacy of Divine Grace


    The Disciple

   O LORD, my God, Who created me to Your own image and likeness, grant me
   this grace which You have shown to be so great and necessary for
   salvation, that I may overcome my very evil nature that is drawing me
   to sin and perdition. For I feel in my flesh the law of sin
   contradicting the law of my mind and leading me captive to serve
   sensuality in many things. I cannot resist the passions thereof unless
   Your most holy grace warmly infused into my heart assist me.

   There is need of Your grace, and of great grace, in order to overcome a
   nature prone to evil from youth. For through the first man, Adam,
   nature is fallen and weakened by sin, and the punishment of that stain
   has fallen upon all mankind. Thus nature itself, which You created good
   and right, is considered a symbol of vice and the weakness of corrupted
   nature, because when left to itself it tends toward evil and to baser
   things. The little strength remaining in it is like a spark hidden in
   ashes. That strength is natural reason which, surrounded by thick
   darkness, still has the power of judging good and evil, of seeing the
   difference between true and false, though it is not able to fulfill all
   that it approves and does not enjoy the full light of truth or
   soundness of affection.

   Hence it is, my God, that according to the inward man I delight in Your
   law, knowing that Your command is good, just, and holy, and that it
   proves the necessity of shunning all evil and sin. But in the flesh I
   keep the law of sin, obeying sensuality rather than reason. Hence,
   also, it is that the will to good is present in me, but how to
   accomplish it I know not. Hence, too, I often propose many good things,
   but because the grace to help my weakness is lacking, I recoil and give
   up at the slightest resistance. Thus it is that I know the way of
   perfection and see clearly enough how I ought to act, but because I am
   pressed down by the weight of my own corruption I do not rise to more
   perfect things.

   How extremely necessary to me, O Lord, Your grace is to begin any good
   deed, to carry it on and bring it to completion! For without grace I
   can do nothing, but with its strength I can do all things in You. O
   Grace truly heavenly, without which our merits are nothing and no gifts
   of nature are to be esteemed!

   Before You, O Lord, no arts or riches, no beauty or strength, no wit or
   intelligence avail without grace. For the gifts of nature are common to
   good and bad alike, but the peculiar gift of Your elect is grace or
   love, and those who are signed with it are held worthy of everlasting
   life. So excellent is this grace that without it no gift of prophecy or
   of miracles, no meditation be it ever so exalted, can be considered
   anything. Not even faith or hope or other virtues are acceptable to You
   without charity and grace.

   O most blessed grace, which makes the poor in spirit rich in virtues,
   which renders him who is rich in many good things humble of heart,
   come, descend upon me, fill me quickly with your consolation lest my
   soul faint with weariness and dryness of mind.

   Let me find grace in Your sight, I beg, Lord, for Your grace is enough
   for me, even though I obtain none of the things which nature desires.
   If I am tempted and afflicted with many tribulations, I will fear no
   evils while Your grace is with me. This is my strength. This will give
   me counsel and help. This is more powerful than all my enemies and
   wiser than all the wise. This is the mistress of truth, the teacher of
   discipline, the light of the heart, the consoler in anguish, the
   banisher of sorrow, the expeller of fear, the nourisher of devotion,
   the producer of tears. What am I without grace, but dead wood, a
   useless branch, fit only to be cast away?

   Let Your grace, therefore, go before me and follow me, O Lord, and make
   me always intent upon good works, through Jesus Christ, Your Son.

    The Fifty-Sixth Chapter

  We Ought to Deny Ourselves and Imitate Christ Through Bearing the Cross


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, the more you depart from yourself, the more you will be able
   to enter into Me. As the giving up of exterior things brings interior
   peace, so the forsaking of self unites you to God. I will have you
   learn perfect surrender to My will, without contradiction or complaint.

   Follow Me. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Without the Way,
   there is no going. Without the Truth, there is no knowing. Without the
   Life, there is no living. I am the Way which you must follow, the Truth
   which you must believe, the Life for which you must hope. I am the
   inviolable Way, the infallible Truth, the unending Life. I am the Way
   that is straight, the supreme Truth, the Life that is true, the
   blessed, the uncreated Life. If you abide in My Way you shall know the
   Truth, and the Truth shall make you free, and you shall attain life
   everlasting.

   If you wish to enter into life, keep My commandments. If you will know
   the truth, believe in Me. If you will be perfect, sell all. If you will
   be My disciple, deny yourself. If you will possess the blessed life,
   despise this present life. If you will be exalted in heaven, humble
   yourself on earth. If you wish to reign with Me, carry the Cross with
   Me. For only the servants of the Cross find the life of blessedness and
   of true light.


    The Disciple

   Lord Jesus, because Your way is narrow and despised by the world, grant
   that I may despise the world and imitate You. For the servant is not
   greater than his Lord, nor the disciple above the Master. Let Your
   servant be trained in Your life, for there is my salvation and true
   holiness. Whatever else I read or hear does not fully refresh or
   delight me.


    The Voice of Christ

   My child, now that you know these things and have read them all, happy
   will you be if you do them. He who has My commandments and keeps them,
   he it is that loves Me. And I will love him and will show Myself to
   him, and will bring it about that he will sit down with Me in My
   Father's Kingdom.


    The Disciple

   Lord Jesus, as You have said, so be it, and what You have promised, let
   it be my lot to win. I have received the cross, from Your hand I have
   received it. I will carry it, carry it even unto death as You have laid
   it upon me. Truly, the life of a good religious man is a cross, but it
   leads to paradise. We have begun--we may not go back, nor may we leave
   off.

   Take courage, brethren, let us go forward together and Jesus will be
   with us. For Jesus' sake we have taken this cross. For Jesus' sake let
   us persevere with it. He will be our help as He is also our leader and
   guide. Behold, our King goes before us and will fight for us. Let us
   follow like men. Let no man fear any terrors. Let us be prepared to
   meet death valiantly in battle. Let us not suffer our glory to be
   blemished by fleeing from the Cross.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifty-Seventh Chapter

  A Man Should Not Be Too Downcast When He Falls Into Defects


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, patience and humility in adversity are more pleasing to Me
   than much consolation and devotion when things are going well.

   Why are you saddened by some little thing said against you? Even if it
   had been more you ought not to have been affected. But now let it pass.
   It is not the first, nor is it anything new, and if you live long it
   will not be the last.

   You are manly enough so long as you meet no opposition. You give good
   advice to others, and you know how to strengthen them with words, but
   when unexpected tribulation comes to your door, you fail both in
   counsel and in strength. Consider your great weakness, then, which you
   experience so often in small matters. Yet when these and like trials
   happen, they happen for your good.

   Put it out of your heart as best you know how, and if it has touched
   you, still do not let it cast you down or confuse you for long. Bear it
   patiently at least, if you cannot bear it cheerfully. Even though you
   bear it unwillingly, and are indignant at it, restrain yourself and let
   no ill-ordered words pass your lips at which the weak might be
   scandalized. The storm that is now aroused will soon be quieted and
   your inward grief will be sweetened by returning grace. "I yet live,"
   says the Lord, "ready to help you and to console you more and more, if
   you trust in Me and call devoutly upon Me."

   Remain tranquil and prepare to bear still greater trials. All is not
   lost even though you be troubled oftener or tempted more grievously.
   You are a man, not God. You are flesh, not an angel. How can you
   possibly expect to remain always in the same state of virtue when the
   angels in heaven and the first man in paradise failed to do so? I am He
   Who rescues the afflicted and brings to My divinity those who know
   their own weakness.


    The Disciple

   Blessed be Your words, O Lord, sweeter to my mouth than honey and the
   honeycomb. What would I do in such great trials and anxieties, if You
   did not strengthen me with Your holy words? If I may but attain to the
   haven of salvation, what does it matter what or how much I suffer?
   Grant me a good end. Grant me a happy passage out of this world.
   Remember me, my God, and lead me by the right way into Your kingdom.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifty-Eighth Chapter

  High Matters and the Hidden Judgments of God Are Not to Be Scrutinized


    The Voice of Christ

   MY CHILD, beware of discussing high matters and God's hidden
   judgments--why this person is so forsaken and why that one is favored
   with so great a grace, or why one man is so afflicted and another so
   highly exalted. Such things are beyond all human understanding and no
   reason or disputation can fathom the judgments of God.

   When the enemy puts such suggestions in your mind, therefore, or when
   some curious persons raise questions about them, answer with the
   prophet: "Thou art just, O Lord, and righteous are Thy judgments"; [42]
   and this: "The judgments of the Lord are true and wholly righteous."
   [43] My judgments are to be feared, not discussed, because they are
   incomprehensible to the understanding of men.

   In like manner, do not inquire or dispute about the merits of the
   saints, as to which is more holy, or which shall be greater in the
   kingdom of heaven. Such things often breed strife and useless
   contentions. They nourish pride and vainglory, whence arise envy and
   quarrels, when one proudly tries to exalt one saint and the other
   another. A desire to know and pry into such matters brings forth no
   fruit. On the contrary, it displeases the saints, because I am the God,
   not of dissension, but of peace--of that peace which consists in true
   humility rather than in self-exaltation.

   Some are drawn by the ardor of their love with greater affection to
   these saints or to those, but this affection is human and not divine. I
   am He who made all the saints. I gave them grace: I brought them to
   glory. I know the merits of each of them. I came before them in the
   blessings of My sweetness. I knew My beloved ones before the ages. I
   chose them out of the world--they did not choose Me. I called them by
   grace, I drew them on by mercy. I led them safely through various
   temptations. I poured into them glorious consolations. I gave them
   perseverance and I crowned their patience. I know the first and the
   last. I embrace them all with love inestimable. I am to be praised in
   all My saints. I am to be blessed above all things, and honored in each
   of those whom I have exalted and predestined so gloriously without any
   previous merits of their own.

   He who despises one of the least of mine, therefore, does no honor to
   the greatest, for both the small and the great I made. And he who
   disparages one of the saints disparages Me also and all others in the
   kingdom of heaven. They are all one through the bond of charity. They
   have the same thought and the same will, and they mutually love one
   another; but, what is a much greater thing, they love Me more than
   themselves or their own merits. Rapt above themselves, and drawn beyond
   love of self, they are entirely absorbed in love of Me, in Whom they
   rest. There is nothing that can draw them away or depress them, for
   they who are filled with eternal truth burn with the fire of
   unquenchable love.

   Therefore, let carnal and sensual men, who know only how to love their
   own selfish joys, forbear to dispute about the state of God's saints.
   Such men take away and add according to their own inclinations and not
   as it pleases the Eternal Truth. In many this is sheer ignorance,
   especially in those who are but little enlightened and can rarely love
   anyone with a purely spiritual love. They are still strongly drawn by
   natural affection and human friendship to one person or another, and on
   their behavior in such things here below are based their imaginings of
   heavenly things. But there is an incomparable distance between the
   things which the imperfect imagine and those which enlightened men
   contemplate through revelation from above.

   Be careful, then, My child, of treating matters beyond your knowledge
   out of curiosity. Let it rather be your business and aim to be found,
   even though the least, in the kingdom of God. For though one were to
   know who is more holy than another, or who is greater in the kingdom of
   heaven, of what value would this knowledge be to him unless out of it
   he should humble himself before Me and should rise up in greater praise
   of My name?

   The man who thinks of the greatness of his own sins and the littleness
   of his virtues, and of the distance between himself and the perfection
   of the saints, acts much more acceptably to God than the one who argues
   about who is greater or who is less. It is better to invoke the saints
   with devout prayers and tears, and with a humble mind to beg their
   glorious aid, than to search with vain inquisitiveness into their
   secrets.

   The saints are well and perfectly contented if men know how to content
   themselves and cease their useless discussions. They do not glory in
   their own merits, for they attribute no good to themselves but all to
   Me, because out of My infinite charity I gave all to them. They are
   filled with such love of God and with such overflowing joy, that no
   glory is wanting to them and they can lack no happiness. All the saints
   are so much higher in glory as they are more humble in themselves;
   nearer to Me, and more beloved by Me. Therefore, you find it written
   that they cast their crowns before God, and fell down upon their faces
   before the Lamb, and adored Him Who lives forever.

   Many ask who is the greater in the kingdom of heaven when they do not
   know whether they themselves shall be worthy of being numbered among
   its least. It is a great thing to be even the least in heaven where all
   are great because all shall be called, and shall be, the children of
   God. The least shall be as a thousand, and the sinner of a hundred
   years shall die. For when the disciples asked who should be greater in
   the kingdom of heaven they heard this response: "Unless you be
   converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whosoever shall humble himself as this
   little child, he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven." [44]

   Woe to those, therefore, who disdain to humble themselves willingly
   with the little children, for the low gate of the heavenly kingdom will
   not permit them to enter. Woe also to the rich who have their
   consolations here, for when the poor enter into God's kingdom, they
   will stand outside lamenting. Rejoice, you humble, and exult, you poor,
   for the kingdom of God is yours, if only you walk in the truth.

    The Fifty-Ninth Chapter

  All Hope and Trust Are to Be Fixed In God Alone


    The Disciple

   WHAT, Lord, is the trust which I have in this life, or what is my
   greatest comfort among all the things that appear under heaven? Is it
   not You, O Lord, my God, Whose mercies are without number? Where have I
   ever fared well but for You? Or how could things go badly when You were
   present? I had rather be poor for Your sake than rich without You. I
   prefer rather to wander on the earth with You than to possess heaven
   without You. Where You are there is heaven, and where You are not are
   death and hell. You are my desire and therefore I must cry after You
   and sigh and pray. In none can I fully trust to help me in my
   necessities, but in You alone, my God. You are my hope. You are my
   confidence. You are my consoler, most faithful in every need.

   All seek their own interests. You, however, place my salvation and my
   profit first, and turn all things to my good. Even though exposing me
   to various temptations and hardships, You Who are accustomed to prove
   Your loved ones in a thousand ways, order all this for my good. You
   ought not to be loved or praised less in this trial than if You had
   filled me with heavenly consolations.

   In You, therefore, O Lord God, I place all my hope and my refuge. On
   You I cast all my troubles and anguish, because whatever I have outside
   of You I find to be weak and unstable. It will not serve me to have
   many friends, nor will powerful helpers be able to assist me, nor
   prudent advisers to give useful answers, nor the books of learned men
   to console, nor any precious substance to win my freedom, nor any
   place, secret and beautiful though it be, to shelter me, if You
   Yourself do not assist, comfort, console, instruct, and guard me. For
   all things which seem to be for our peace and happiness are nothing
   when You are absent, and truly confer no happiness.

   You, indeed, are the fountain of all good, the height of life, the
   depth of all that can be spoken. To trust in You above all things is
   the strongest comfort of Your servants.

   My God, the Father of mercies, to You I look, in You I trust. Bless and
   sanctify my soul with heavenly benediction, so that it may become Your
   holy dwelling and the seat of Your eternal glory. And in this temple of
   Your dignity let nothing be found that might offend Your majesty. In
   Your great goodness, and in the multitude of Your mercies, look upon me
   and listen to the prayer of Your poor servant exiled from You in the
   region of the shadow of death. Protect and preserve the soul of Your
   poor servant among the many dangers of this corruptible life, and
   direct him by Your accompanying grace, through the ways of peace, to
   the land of everlasting light.

  BOOK FOUR


AN INVITATION TO HOLY COMMUNION



    The Voice of Christ

   COME to Me, all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh
   you. [45] The bread which I will give is My Flesh, for the life of the
   world. [46] Take you and eat: this is My Body, which shall be delivered
   for you. Do this for the commemoration of Me. [47] He that eateth My
   flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him. [48] The
   words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life." [49]


     __________________________________________________________________

    The First Chapter

  The Great Reverence With Which We Should Receive Christ


    The Disciple

   THESE are all Your words, O Christ, eternal Truth, though they were not
   all spoken at one time nor written together in one place. And because
   they are Yours and true, I must accept them all with faith and
   gratitude. They are Yours and You have spoken them; they are mine also
   because You have spoken them for my salvation. Gladly I accept them
   from Your lips that they may be the more deeply impressed in my heart.

   Words of such tenderness, so full of sweetness and love, encourage me;
   but my sins frighten me and an unclean conscience thunders at me when
   approaching such great mysteries as these. The sweetness of Your words
   invites me, but the multitude of my vices oppresses me.

   You command me to approach You confidently if I wish to have part with
   You, and to receive the food of immortality if I desire to obtain life
   and glory everlasting.

   "Come to me," You say, "all you that labor and are burdened, and I will
   refresh you." [50]

   Oh, how sweet and kind to the ear of the sinner is the word by which
   You, my Lord God, invite the poor and needy to receive Your most holy
   Body! Who am I, Lord, that I should presume to approach You? Behold,
   the heaven of heavens cannot contain You, and yet You say: "Come, all
   of you, to Me."

   What means this most gracious honor and this friendly invitation? How
   shall I dare to come, I who am conscious of no good on which to
   presume? How shall I lead You into my house, I who have so often
   offended in Your most kindly sight? Angels and archangels revere You,
   the holy and the just fear You, and You say: "Come to Me: all of you!"
   If You, Lord, had not said it, who would have believed it to be true?
   And if You had not commanded, who would dare approach?

   Behold, Noah, a just man, worked a hundred years building the ark that
   he and a few others might be saved; how, then, can I prepare myself in
   one hour to receive with reverence the Maker of the world?

   Moses, Your great servant and special friend, made an ark of
   incorruptible wood which he covered with purest gold wherein to place
   the tables of Your law; shall I, a creature of corruption, dare so
   easily to receive You, the Maker of law and the Giver of life?

   Solomon, the wisest of the kings of Israel, spent seven years building
   a magnificent temple in praise of Your name, and celebrated its
   dedication with a feast of eight days. He offered a thousand victims in
   Your honor and solemnly bore the Ark of the Covenant with trumpeting
   and jubilation to the place prepared for it; and I, unhappy and poorest
   of men, how shall I lead You into my house, I who scarcely can spend a
   half-hour devoutly--would that I could spend even that as I ought!

   O my God, how hard these men tried to please You! Alas, how little is
   all that I do! How short the time I spend in preparing for Communion! I
   am seldom wholly recollected, and very seldom, indeed, entirely free
   from distraction. Yet surely in the presence of Your life-giving
   Godhead no unbecoming thought should arise and no creature possess my
   heart, for I am about to receive as my guest, not an angel, but the
   very Lord of angels.

   Very great, too, is the difference between the Ark of the Covenant with
   its treasures and Your most pure Body with its ineffable virtues,
   between these sacrifices of the law which were but figures of things to
   come and the true offering of Your Body which was the fulfillment of
   all ancient sacrifices.

   Why, then, do I not long more ardently for Your adorable presence? Why
   do I not prepare myself with greater care to receive Your sacred gifts,
   since those holy patriarchs and prophets of old, as well as kings and
   princes with all their people, have shown such affectionate devotion
   for the worship of God?

   The most devout King David danced before the ark of God with all his
   strength as he recalled the benefits once bestowed upon his fathers. He
   made musical instruments of many kinds. He composed psalms and ordered
   them sung with joy. He himself often played upon the harp when moved by
   the grace of the Holy Ghost. He taught the people of Israel to praise
   God with all their hearts and to raise their voices every day to bless
   and glorify Him. If such great devotion flourished in those days and
   such ceremony in praise of God before the Ark of the Covenant, what
   great devotion ought not I and all Christian people now show in the
   presence of this Sacrament; what reverence in receiving the most
   excellent Body of Christ!

   Many people travel far to honor the relics of the saints, marveling at
   their wonderful deeds and at the building of magnificent shrines. They
   gaze upon and kiss the sacred relics encased in silk and gold; and
   behold, You are here present before me on the altar, my God, Saint of
   saints, Creator of men, and Lord of angels!

   Often in looking at such things, men are moved by curiosity, by the
   novelty of the unseen, and they bear away little fruit for the
   amendment of their lives, especially when they go from place to place
   lightly and without true contrition. But here in the Sacrament of the
   altar You are wholly present, my God, the man Christ Jesus, whence is
   obtained the full realization of eternal salvation, as often as You are
   worthily and devoutly received. To this, indeed, we are not drawn by
   levity, or curiosity, or sensuality, but by firm faith, devout hope,
   and sincere love.

   O God, hidden Creator of the world, how wonderfully You deal with us!
   How sweetly and graciously You dispose of things with Your elect to
   whom You offer Yourself to be received in this Sacrament! This, indeed,
   surpasses all understanding. This in a special manner attracts the
   hearts of the devout and inflames their love. Your truly faithful
   servants, who give their whole life to amendment, often receive in Holy
   Communion the great grace of devotion and love of virtue.

   Oh, the wonderful and hidden grace of this Sacrament which only the
   faithful of Christ understand, which unbelievers and slaves of sin
   cannot experience! In it spiritual grace is conferred, lost virtue
   restored, and the beauty, marred by sin, repaired. At times, indeed,
   its grace is so great that, from the fullness of the devotion, not only
   the mind but also the frail body feels filled with greater strength.

   Nevertheless, our neglect and coldness is much to be deplored and
   pitied, when we are not moved to receive with greater fervor Christ in
   Whom is the hope and merit of all who will be saved. He is our
   sanctification and redemption. He is our consolation in this life and
   the eternal joy of the blessed in heaven. This being true, it is
   lamentable that many pay so little heed to the salutary Mystery which
   fills the heavens with joy and maintains the whole universe in being.

   Oh, the blindness and the hardness of the heart of man that does not
   show more regard for so wonderful a gift, but rather falls into
   carelessness from its daily use! If this most holy Sacrament were
   celebrated in only one place and consecrated by only one priest in the
   whole world, with what great desire, do you think, would men be
   attracted to that place, to that priest of God, in order to witness the
   celebration of the divine Mysteries! But now there are many priests and
   Mass is offered in many places, that God's grace and love for men may
   appear the more clearly as the Sacred Communion is spread more widely
   through the world.

   Thanks be to You, Jesus, everlasting Good Shepherd, Who have seen fit
   to feed us poor exiled people with Your precious Body and Blood, and to
   invite us with words from Your own lips to partake of these sacred
   Mysteries: "Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will
   refresh you."

    The Second Chapter

  God's Great Goodness and Love is Shown to Man in This Sacrament


    The Disciple

   TRUSTING in Your goodness and great mercy, O Lord, I come as one sick
   to the Healer, as one hungry and thirsty to the Fountain of life, as
   one in need to the King of heaven, a servant to his Lord, a creature to
   his Creator, a soul in desolation to my gentle Comforter.

   But whence is this to me, that You should come to me? Who am I that You
   should offer Yourself to me? How dares the sinner to appear in Your
   presence, and You, how do You condescend to come to the sinner? You
   know Your servant, and You know that he has nothing good in him that
   You should grant him this.

   I confess, therefore, my unworthiness. I acknowledge Your goodness. I
   praise Your mercy, and give thanks for Your immense love. For it is
   because of Yourself that You do it, not for any merit of mine; so that
   Your goodness may be better known to me, that greater love may be
   aroused and more perfect humility born in me. Since, then, this pleases
   You and You have so willed it, Your graciousness pleases me also. Oh,
   that my sinfulness may not stand in the way!

   O most sweet and merciful Jesus, what great reverence, thanks, and
   never-ending praise are due to You for our taking of Your sacred body,
   whose dignity no man can express!

   But on what shall I think in this Communion, this approach to my Lord,
   Whom I can never reverence as I ought, and yet Whom I desire devoutly
   to receive? What thought better, more helpful to me than to humble
   myself entirely in Your presence and exalt Your infinite goodness above
   myself?

   I praise You, my God, and extol You forever! I despise myself and cast
   myself before You in the depths of my unworthiness. Behold, You are the
   Holy of holies, and I the scum of sinners! Behold, You bow down to me
   who am not worthy to look up to You! Behold, You come to me! You will
   to be with me! You invite me to Your banquet! You desire to give me
   heavenly food, the Bread of Angels to eat, none other than Yourself,
   the living Bread Who are come down from heaven and give life to the
   world.

   Behold, whence love proceeds! What condescension shines forth! What
   great thanks and praise are due You for these gifts! Oh, how salutary
   and profitable was Your design in this institution! How sweet and
   pleasant the banquet when You gave Yourself as food!

   How admirable is Your work, O Lord! How great Your power! How
   infallible Your truth! For You spoke and all things were made, and
   this, which You commanded, was done. It is a wonderful thing, worthy of
   faith, overpowering human understanding, that You, O Lord, my God, true
   God and man, are contained whole and entire under the appearance of a
   little bread and wine, and without being consumed are eaten by him who
   receives You!

   You, the Lord of the universe, Who have need of nothing, have willed to
   dwell in us by means of Your Sacrament. Keep my heart and body clean,
   so that with a joyous and spotless conscience I may be able often to
   celebrate Your Mysteries and to receive for my eternal salvation what
   You have ordained and instituted for Your special honor and as an
   everlasting memorial.

   Rejoice, my soul, and give thanks to God for having left you so noble a
   gift and so special a consolation in this valley of tears. As often as
   you renew this Mystery and receive the Body of Christ, so often do you
   enact the work of redemption and become a sharer in all the merits of
   Christ, for the love of Christ never grows less and the wealth of His
   mercy is never exhausted.

   Therefore, you should prepare yourself for it by constantly renewing
   your heart and pondering deeply the great mystery of salvation. As
   often as you celebrate or hear Mass, it should seem as great, as new,
   as sweet to you as if on that very day Christ became man in the womb of
   the Virgin, or, hanging on the Cross, suffered and died for the
   salvation of man.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Third Chapter

  It Is Profitable to Receive Communion Often


    The Disciple

   BEHOLD, I come to You, Lord, that I may prosper by Your gift and be
   delighted at Your holy banquet which You, O God, in Your sweetness have
   prepared for Your poor. Behold, all that I can or ought to desire is in
   You. You are my salvation and my redemption, my hope and strength, my
   honor and glory.

   Gladden, then, this day the soul of Your servant because I have raised
   my heart to You, O Lord Jesus. I long to receive You now, devoutly and
   reverently. I desire to bring You into my house that, with Zacheus, I
   may merit Your blessing and be numbered among the children of Abraham.

   My soul longs for Your Body; my heart desires to be united with You.
   Give me Yourself--it is enough; for without You there is no
   consolation. Without You I cannot exist, without Your visitation I
   cannot live. I must often come to You, therefore, and receive the
   strength of my salvation lest, deprived of this heavenly food, I grow
   weak on the way. Once, most merciful Jesus, while preaching to the
   people and healing their many ills, You said: "I will not send them
   away fasting, lest they faint in the way." [51] Deal with me likewise,
   You Who have left Yourself in this Sacrament for the consolation of the
   faithful. You are sweet refreshment to the soul, and he who eats You
   worthily will be a sharer in, and an heir to, eternal glory.

   It is indeed necessary for me, who fall and sin so often, who so
   quickly become lax and weak, to renew, cleanse, and inflame myself
   through frequent prayer, confession, and the holy reception of Your
   Body, lest perhaps by abstaining too long, I fall away from my holy
   purpose. For from the days of his youth the senses of man are prone to
   evil, and unless divine aid strengthens him, he quickly falls deeper.
   But Holy Communion removes him from evil and confirms him in good.

   If I am so often careless and lax when I celebrate or communicate, what
   would happen if I did not receive this remedy and seek so great a help?
   Although I am neither fit nor properly disposed to celebrate every day,
   yet I will do my best at proper times to receive the divine Mysteries
   and share in this great grace. This, indeed, is the one chief
   consolation of the faithful soul when separated from You by mortality,
   that often mindful of her God, she receives her Beloved with devout
   recollection.

   Oh, wonderful condescension of Your affection toward us, that You, the
   Lord God, Creator and Giver of life to all, should see fit to come to a
   poor soul and to appease her hunger with all Your divinity and
   humanity! O happy mind and blessed soul which deserves to receive You,
   her Lord God, and in receiving You, is filled with spiritual joy! How
   great a Master she entertains, what a beloved guest she receives, how
   sweet a companion she welcomes, how true a friend she gains, how
   beautiful and noble is the spouse she embraces, beloved and desired
   above all things that can be loved and desired! Let heaven and earth
   and all their treasures stand silent before Your face, most sweetly
   Beloved, for whatever glory and beauty they have is of Your
   condescending bounty, and they cannot approach the beauty of Your name,
   Whose wisdom is untold.

    The Fourth Chapter

  Many Blessings Are Given Those Who Receive Communion Worthily


    The Disciple

   O LORD my God, favor Your servant with the blessings of Your sweetness
   that I may merit to approach Your magnificent Sacrament worthily and
   devoutly. Lift up my heart to You and take away from me this heavy
   indolence. Visit me with Your saving grace that I may in spirit taste
   Your sweetness which lies hidden in this Sacrament like water in the
   depths of a spring. Enlighten my eyes to behold this great Mystery, and
   give me strength to believe in it with firm faith.

   For it is Your work, not the power of man, Your sacred institution, not
   his invention. No man is able of himself to comprehend and understand
   these things which surpass even the keen vision of angels. How, then,
   shall I, an unworthy sinner who am but dust and ashes, be able to
   fathom and understand so great a mystery?

   O Lord, I come to You at Your command in simplicity of heart, in good,
   firm faith, with hope and reverence, and I truly believe that You are
   present here in this Sacrament, God and man. It is Your will that I
   receive You and unite myself to You in love. Wherefore, I beg Your
   mercy and ask that special grace be given me, that I may be wholly
   dissolved in You and filled with Your love, no longer to concern myself
   with exterior consolations. For this, the highest and most worthy
   Sacrament, is the health of soul and body, the cure of every spiritual
   weakness. In it my defects are remedied, my passions restrained, and
   temptations overcome or allayed. In it greater grace is infused,
   growing virtue is nourished, faith confirmed, hope strengthened, and
   charity fanned into flame.

   You, my God, the protector of my soul, the strength of human weakness,
   and the giver of every interior consolation, have given and still do
   often give in this Sacrament great gifts to Your loved ones who
   communicate devoutly. Moreover, You give them many consolations amid
   their numerous troubles and lift them from the depths of dejection to
   the hope of Your protection. With new graces You cheer and lighten them
   within, so that they who are full of anxiety and without affection
   before Communion may find themselves changed for the better after
   partaking of this heavenly food and drink.

   Likewise, You so deal with Your elect that they may truly acknowledge
   and plainly experience how weak they are in themselves and what
   goodness and grace they obtain from You. For though in themselves they
   are cold, obdurate, and wanting in devotion, through You they become
   fervent, cheerful, and devout.

   Who, indeed, can humbly approach the fountain of sweetness and not
   carry away a little of it? Or who, standing before a blazing fire does
   not feel some of its heat? You are a fountain always filled with
   superabundance! You are a fire, ever burning, that never fails!

   Therefore, while I may not exhaust the fullness of the fountain or
   drink to satiety, yet will I put my lips to the mouth of this heavenly
   stream that from it I may receive at least some small drop to refresh
   my thirst and not wither away. And if I cannot as yet be all heavenly
   or as full of fire as the cherubim and seraphim, yet I will try to
   become more devout and prepare my heart so that I may gather some small
   spark of divine fire from the humble reception of this life-giving
   Sacrament.

   Whatever is wanting in me, good Jesus, Savior most holy, do You in Your
   kindness and grace supply for me, You Who have been pleased to call all
   unto You, saying: "Come to Me all you that labor and are burdened and I
   will refresh you."

   I, indeed, labor in the sweat of my brow. I am torn with sorrow of
   heart. I am laden with sin, troubled with temptations, enmeshed and
   oppressed by many evil passions, and there is none to help me, none to
   deliver and save me but You, my Lord God and Savior, to Whom I entrust
   myself and all I have, that You may protect me and lead me to eternal
   life. For the honor and glory of Your name receive me, You Who have
   prepared Your Body and Blood as food and drink for me. Grant, O Lord,
   my God and Savior, that by approaching Your Mysteries frequently, the
   zeal of my devotion may increase.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifth Chapter

  The Dignity of the Sacrament and of the Priesthood


    The Voice of Christ

   HAD you the purity of an angel and the sanctity of St. John the
   Baptist, you would not be worthy to receive or administer this
   Sacrament. It is not because of any human meriting that a man
   consecrates and administers the Sacrament of Christ, and receives the
   Bread of Angels for his food. Great is the Mystery and great the
   dignity of priests to whom is given that which has not been granted the
   angels. For priests alone, rightly ordained in the Church, have power
   to celebrate Mass and consecrate the Body of Christ.

   The priest, indeed, is the minister of God, using the word of God
   according to His command and appointment. God, moreover, is there--the
   chief Author and invisible Worker to Whom all is subject as He wills,
   to Whom all are obedient as He commands.

   In this most excellent Sacrament, therefore, you ought to believe in
   God rather than in your own senses or in any visible sign, and thus,
   with fear and reverence draw near to such a work as this. Look to
   yourself and see whose ministry has been given you through the
   imposition of the bishop's hands.

   Behold, you have been made a priest, consecrated to celebrate Mass! See
   to it now that you offer sacrifice to God faithfully and devoutly at
   proper times, and that you conduct yourself blamelessly. You have not
   made your burden lighter. Instead, you are now bound by stricter
   discipline and held to more perfect sanctity.

   A priest ought to be adorned with all virtues and show the example of a
   good life to others. His way lies not among the vulgar and common
   habits of men but with the angels in heaven and the perfect men on
   earth. A priest clad in the sacred vestments acts in Christ's place,
   that he may pray to God both for himself and for all people in a
   suppliant and humble manner. He has before and behind him the sign of
   the Lord's cross that he may always remember the Passion of Christ. It
   is before him, on the chasuble, that he may look closely upon the
   footsteps of Christ and try to follow them fervently. It is behind
   him--he is signed with it--that he may gladly suffer for God any
   adversities inflicted by others.

   He wears the cross before him that he may mourn his own sins, behind
   him, that in pity he may mourn the sins of others, and know that he is
   appointed to stand between God and the sinner, never to become weary of
   prayer and the holy offering until it is granted him to obtain grace
   and mercy.

   When the priest celebrates Mass, he honors God, gladdens the angels,
   strengthens the Church, helps the living, brings rest to the departed,
   and wins for himself a share in all good things.

    The Sixth Chapter

  An Inquiry on the Proper Thing to Do Before Communion


    The Disciple

   WHEN I consider Your dignity, O Lord, and my own meanness, I become
   very much frightened and confused. For if I do not receive, I fly from
   Life, and if I intrude unworthily, I incur Your displeasure. What,
   then, shall I do, my God, my Helper and Adviser in necessity? Teach me
   the right way. Place before me some short exercise suitable for Holy
   Communion, for it is good to know in what manner I ought to make my
   heart ready devoutly and fervently for You, to receive Your Sacrament
   for the good of my soul, or even to celebrate so great and divine a
   sacrifice.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Seventh Chapter

  The Examination of Conscience and the Resolution to Amend


    The Voice of Christ

   ABOVE all, God's priest should approach the celebration and reception
   of this Sacrament with the deepest humility of heart and suppliant
   reverence, with complete faith and the pious intention of giving honor
   to God.

   Carefully examine your conscience, then. Cleanse and purify it to the
   best of your power by true contrition and humble confession, that you
   may have no burden, know of no remorse, and thus be free to come near.
   Let the memory of all your sins grieve you, and especially lament and
   bewail your daily transgressions. Then if time permits, confess to God
   in the secret depths of your heart all the miseries your passions have
   caused.

   Lament and grieve because you are still so worldly, so carnal, so
   passionate and unmortified, so full of roving lust, so careless in
   guarding the external senses, so often occupied in many vain fancies,
   so inclined to exterior things and so heedless of what lies within, so
   prone to laughter and dissipation and so indisposed to sorrow and
   tears, so inclined to ease and the pleasures of the flesh and so cool
   to austerity and zeal, so curious to hear what is new and to see the
   beautiful and so slow to embrace humiliation and dejection, so covetous
   of abundance, so niggardly in giving and so tenacious in keeping, so
   inconsiderate in speech, so reluctant in silence, so undisciplined in
   character, so disordered in action, so greedy at meals, so deaf to the
   Word of God, so prompt to rest and so slow to labor, so awake to empty
   conversation, so sleepy in keeping sacred vigils and so eager to end
   them, so wandering in your attention, so careless in saying the office,
   so lukewarm in celebrating, so heartless in receiving, so quickly
   distracted, so seldom fully recollected, so quickly moved to anger, so
   apt to take offense at others, so prone to judge, so severe in
   condemning, so happy in prosperity and so weak in adversity, so often
   making good resolutions and carrying so few of them into action.

   When you have confessed and deplored these and other faults with sorrow
   and great displeasure because of your weakness, be firmly determined to
   amend your life day by day and to advance in goodness. Then, with
   complete resignation and with your entire will offer yourself upon the
   altar of your heart as an everlasting sacrifice to the honor of My
   name, by entrusting with faith both body and soul to My care, that thus
   you may be considered worthy to draw near and offer sacrifice to God
   and profitably receive the Sacrament of My Body. For there is no more
   worthy offering, no greater satisfaction for washing away sin than to
   offer yourself purely and entirely to God with the offering of the Body
   of Christ in Mass and Communion.

   If a man does what he can and is truly penitent, however often he comes
   to Me for grace and pardon, "As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire
   not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and
   live"; [52] I will no longer remember his sins, but all will be
   forgiven him.

    The Eighth Chapter

  The Offering of Christ on the Cross; Our Offering


    The Voice of Christ

   AS I offered Myself willingly to God the Father for your sins with
   hands outstretched and body naked on the cross, so that nothing
   remained in Me that had not become a complete sacrifice to appease the
   divine wrath, so ought you to be willing to offer yourself to Me day by
   day in the Mass as a pure and holy oblation, together with all your
   faculties and affections, with as much inward devotion as you can.

   What more do I ask than that you give yourself entirely to Me? I care
   not for anything else you may give Me, for I seek not your gift but
   you. Just as it would not be enough for you to have everything if you
   did not have Me, so whatever you give cannot please Me if you do not
   give yourself.

   Offer yourself to Me, therefore, and give yourself entirely for
   God--your offering will be accepted. Behold, I offered Myself wholly to
   the Father for you, I even gave My whole Body and Blood for food that I
   might be all yours, and you Mine forever.

   But if you rely upon self, and do not offer your free will to Mine,
   your offering will be incomplete and the union between us imperfect.
   Hence, if you desire to attain grace and freedom of heart, let the free
   offering of yourself into the hands of God precede your every action.
   This is why so few are inwardly free and enlightened--they know not how
   to renounce themselves entirely.

   My word stands: "Everyone of you that doth not renounce all that he
   possesseth, cannot be My disciple." [53]

   If, therefore, you wish to be My disciple, offer yourself to Me with
   all your heart.

    The Ninth Chapter

  We Should Offer Ourselves and All That We Have to God, Praying for All


    The Disciple

   ALL things in heaven and on earth, O Lord, are Yours. I long to give
   myself to You as a voluntary offering to remain forever Yours. With a
   sincere heart I offer myself this day to You, O Lord, to Your eternal
   service, to Your homage, and as a sacrifice of everlasting praise.
   Receive me with this holy offering of Your precious Body which also I
   make to You this day, in the presence of angels invisibly attending,
   for my salvation and that of all Your people.

   O Lord, upon Your altar of expiation, I offer You all the sins and
   offenses I have committed in Your presence and in the presence of Your
   holy angels, from the day when I first could sin until this hour, that
   You may burn and consume them all in the fire of Your love, that You
   may wipe away their every stain, cleanse my conscience of every fault,
   and restore to me Your grace which I lost in sin by granting full
   pardon for all and receiving me mercifully with the kiss of peace.

   What can I do for all my sins but humbly confess and lament them, and
   implore Your mercy without ceasing? In Your mercy, I implore You, hear
   me when I stand before You, my God. All my sins are most displeasing to
   me. I wish never to commit them again. I am sorry for them and will be
   sorry as long as I live. I am ready to do penance and make satisfaction
   to the utmost of my power.

   Forgive me, O God, forgive me my sins for Your Holy Name. Save my soul
   which You have redeemed by Your most precious Blood. See, I place
   myself at Your mercy. I commit myself to Your hands. Deal with me
   according to Your goodness, not according to my malicious and evil
   ways.

   I offer to You also all the good I have, small and imperfect though it
   be, that You may make it more pure and more holy, that You may be
   pleased with it, render it acceptable to Yourself, and perfect it more
   and more, and finally that You may lead me, an indolent and worthless
   creature, to a good and happy end.

   I offer You also all the holy desires of Your devoted servants, the
   needs of my parents, friends, brothers, sisters, and all who are dear
   to me; of all who for Your sake have been kind to me or to others; of
   all who have wished and asked my prayers and Masses for them and
   theirs, whether they yet live in the flesh or are now departed from
   this world, that they may all experience the help of Your grace, the
   strength of Your consolation, protection from dangers, deliverance from
   punishment to come, and that, free from all evils, they may gladly give
   abundant thanks to You.

   I offer You also these prayers and the Sacrifice of Propitiation for
   those especially who have in any way injured, saddened, or slandered
   me, inflicted loss or pain upon me, and also for all those whom I have
   at any time saddened, disturbed, offended, and abused by word or deed,
   willfully or in ignorance. May it please You to forgive us all alike
   our sins and offenses against one another.

   Take away from our hearts, O Lord, all suspicion, anger, wrath,
   contention, and whatever may injure charity and lessen brotherly love.
   Have mercy, O Lord, have mercy on those who ask Your mercy, give grace
   to those who need it, and make us such that we may be worthy to enjoy
   Your favor and gain eternal life.

    The Tenth Chapter

  Do Not Lightly Forego Holy Communion


    The Voice of Christ

   YOU must often return to the source of grace and divine mercy, to the
   fountain of goodness and perfect purity, if you wish to be free from
   passion and vice, if you desire to be made stronger and more watchful
   against all the temptations and deceits of the devil.

   The enemy, knowing the great good and the healing power of Holy
   Communion, tries as much as he can by every manner and means to hinder
   and keep away the faithful and the devout. Indeed, there are some who
   suffer the worst assaults of Satan when disposing themselves to prepare
   for Holy Communion. As it is written in Job, this wicked spirit comes
   among the sons of God to trouble them by his wonted malice, to make
   them unduly fearful and perplexed, that thus he may lessen their
   devotion or attack their faith to such an extent that they perhaps
   either forego Communion altogether or receive with little fervor.

   No attention, however, must be paid to his cunning wiles, no matter how
   base and horrible--all his suggestions must be cast back upon his head.
   The wretch is to be despised and scorned. Holy Communion must not be
   passed by because of any assaults from him or because of the commotion
   he may arouse.

   Oftentimes, also, too great solicitude for devotion and anxiety about
   confession hinder a person. Do as wise men do. Cast off anxiety and
   scruple, for it impedes the grace of God and destroys devotion of the
   mind.

   Do not remain away from Holy Communion because of a small trouble or
   vexation but go at once to confession and willingly forgive all others
   their offenses. If you have offended anyone, humbly seek pardon and God
   will readily forgive you.

   What good is it to delay confession for a long time or to put off Holy
   Communion? Cleanse yourself at once, spit out the poison quickly. Make
   haste to apply the remedy and you will find it better than if you had
   waited a long time. If you put it off today because of one thing,
   perhaps tomorrow a greater will occur to you, and thus you will stay
   away from Communion for a long time and become even more unfit.

   Shake off this heaviness and sloth as quickly as you can, for there is
   no gain in much anxiety, in enduring long hours of trouble, and in
   depriving yourself of the divine Mysteries because of these daily
   disturbances. Yes, it is very hurtful to defer Holy Communion long, for
   it usually brings on a lazy spiritual sleep.

   How sad that some dissolute and lax persons are willing to postpone
   confession and likewise wish to defer Holy Communion, lest they be
   forced to keep a stricter watch over themselves! Alas, how little love
   and devotion have they who so easily put off Holy Communion!

   How happy and acceptable to God is he who so lives, and keeps his
   conscience so pure, as to be ready and well disposed to communicate,
   even every day if he were permitted, and if he could do so unnoticed.

   If, now and then, a man abstains by the grace of humility or for a
   legitimate reason, his reverence is commendable, but if laziness takes
   hold of him, he must arouse himself and do everything in his power, for
   the Lord will quicken his desire because of the good intention to which
   He particularly looks. When he is indeed unable to come, he will always
   have the good will and pious intention to communicate and thus he will
   not lose the fruit of the Sacrament.

   Any devout person may at any hour on any day receive Christ in
   spiritual communion profitably and without hindrance. Yet on certain
   days and times appointed he ought to receive with affectionate
   reverence the Body of his Redeemer in this Sacrament, seeking the
   praise and honor of God rather than his own consolation.

   For as often as he devoutly calls to mind the mystery and passion of
   the Incarnate Christ, and is inflamed with love for Him, he
   communicates mystically and is invisibly refreshed.

   He who prepares himself only when festivals approach or custom demands,
   will often find himself unprepared. Blessed is he who offers himself a
   sacrifice to the Lord as often as he celebrates or communicates.

   Be neither too slow nor too fast in celebrating but follow the good
   custom common to those among whom you are. You ought not to cause
   others inconvenience or trouble, but observe the accepted rule as laid
   down by superiors, and look to the benefit of others rather than to
   your own devotion or inclination.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Eleventh Chapter

  The Body of Christ and Sacred Scripture Are Most Necessary to a Faithful Soul


    The Disciple

   O MOST sweet Lord Jesus, how great is the happiness of the devout soul
   that feasts upon You at Your banquet, where there is set before her to
   be eaten no other food but Yourself alone, her only Lover, most desired
   of all that her heart can desire!

   To me it would be happiness, indeed, to shed tears in Your presence
   from the innermost depths of love, and like the pious Magdalen to wash
   Your feet with them. But where now is this devotion, this copious
   shedding of holy tears? Certainly in Your sight, before Your holy
   angels, my whole heart ought to be inflamed and weep for joy. For,
   hidden though You are beneath another form, I have You truly present in
   the Sacrament.

   My eyes could not bear to behold You in Your own divine brightness, nor
   could the whole world stand in the splendor of the glory of Your
   majesty. In veiling Yourself in the Sacrament, therefore, You have
   regard for my weakness.

   In truth, I possess and adore Him Whom the angels adore in heaven--I as
   yet by faith, they face to face unveiled. I must be content with the
   light of the true faith and walk in it until the day of eternal
   brightness dawns and the shadow of figures passes away. When, moreover,
   that which is perfect shall have come, the need of sacraments shall
   cease, for the blessed in heavenly glory need no healing sacrament.
   Rejoicing endlessly in the presence of God, beholding His glory face to
   face, transformed from their own brightness to the brightness of the
   ineffable Deity, they taste the Word of God made flesh, as He was in
   the beginning and will remain in eternity.

   Though mindful of these wonderful things, every spiritual solace
   becomes wearisome to me because so long as I do not plainly see the
   Lord in His glory, I consider everything I hear and see on earth of
   little account.

   You are my witness, O God, that nothing can comfort me, no creature
   give me rest but You, my God, Whom I desire to contemplate forever. But
   this is not possible while I remain in mortal life, and, therefore, I
   must be very patient and submit myself to You in every desire.

   Even Your saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with You in the kingdom of
   heaven, awaited the coming of Your glory with faith and great patience
   while they lived. What they believed, I believe. What they hoped for, I
   hope for, and whither they arrived, I trust I shall come by Your grace.
   Meanwhile I will walk in faith, strengthened by the example of the
   saints. I shall have, besides, for comfort and for the guidance of my
   life, the holy Books, and above all these, Your most holy Body for my
   special haven and refuge.

   I feel there are especially necessary for me in this life two things
   without which its miseries would be unbearable. Confined here in this
   prison of the body I confess I need these two, food and light.
   Therefore, You have given me in my weakness Your sacred Flesh to
   refresh my soul and body, and You have set Your word as the guiding
   light for my feet. Without them I could not live aright, for the word
   of God is the light of my soul and Your Sacrament is the Bread of Life.

   These also may be called the two tables, one here, one there, in the
   treasure house of holy Church. One is the table of the holy altar,
   having the holy Bread that is the precious Body of Christ. The other is
   the table of divine law, containing holy doctrine that teaches all the
   true faith and firmly leads them within the veil, the Holy of holies.

   Thanks to You, Lord Jesus, Light of eternal light, for the table of
   Your holy teaching which You have prepared for us by Your servants, the
   prophets and Apostles and other learned men.

   Thanks to You, Creator and Redeemer of men, Who, to declare Your love
   to all the world, have prepared a great supper in which You have placed
   before us as food not the lamb, the type of Yourself, but Your own most
   precious Body and Blood, making all the faithful glad in Your sacred
   banquet, intoxicating them with the chalice of salvation in which are
   all the delights of paradise; and the holy angels feast with us but
   with more happiness and sweetness.

   Oh, how great and honorable is the office of the priest, to whom is
   given the consecration of the Lord of majesty in sacred words, whose
   lips bless Him, whose hands hold Him, whose tongue receives Him, and
   whose ministry it is to bring Him to others!

   Oh, how clean those hands should be, how pure the lips, how sanctified
   the body, how immaculate the heart of the priest to whom the Author of
   all purity so often comes. No word but what is holy, none but what is
   good and profitable ought to come from the lips of the priest who so
   often receives the Sacrament of Christ. Single and modest should be the
   eyes accustomed to looking upon the Body of Christ. Pure and lifted up
   to heaven the hands accustomed to handle the Creator of heaven and
   earth. To priests above all it is written in the law: "Be ye holy, for
   I, the Lord your God, am holy."

   Let Your grace, almighty God, assist us, that we who have undertaken
   the office of the priesthood may serve You worthily and devoutly in all
   purity and with a good conscience. And if we cannot live as innocently
   as we ought, grant us at least to lament duly the wrongs we have
   committed and in the spirit of humility and the purpose of a good will
   to serve You more fervently in the future.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Twelfth Chapter

  The Communicant Should Prepare Himself for Christ with Great Care


    The Voice of Christ

   I AM the Lover of purity, the Giver of all holiness. I seek a pure
   heart and there is the place of My rest.

   Prepare for Me a large room furnished and I with My disciples will keep
   the Pasch with you.

   If you wish that I come to you and remain with you, purge out the old
   leaven and make clean the dwelling of your heart. Shut out the whole
   world with all the din of its vices. Sit as the sparrow lonely on the
   housetop, and think on your transgressions in bitterness of soul.

   Everyone who loves prepares the best and most beautiful home for his
   beloved, because the love of the one receiving his lover is recognized
   thereby.

   But understand that you cannot by any merit of your own make this
   preparation well enough, though you spend a year in doing it and think
   of nothing else. It is only by My goodness and grace that you are
   allowed to approach My table, as though a beggar were invited to dinner
   by a rich man and he had nothing to offer in return for the gift but to
   humble himself and give thanks.

   Do what you can and do that carefully. Receive the Body of the Lord,
   your beloved God Who deigns to come to you, not out of habit or
   necessity, but with fear, with reverence, and with love.

   I am He that called you. I ordered it done. I will supply what you
   lack. Come and receive Me.

   When I grant the grace of devotion, give thanks to God, not because you
   are worthy but because I have had mercy upon you. If you have it not
   and feel rather dry instead, continue in prayer, sigh and knock, and do
   not give up until you receive some crumb of saving grace.

   You have need of Me. I do not need you. You do not come to sanctify Me
   but I come to sanctify you and make you better. You come to be
   sanctified and united with Me, to receive new grace and to be aroused
   anew to amend. Do not neglect this grace, but prepare your heart with
   all care, and bring into it your Beloved.

   Not only should you prepare devoutly before Communion, but you should
   also carefully keep yourself in devotion after receiving the Sacrament.
   The careful custody of yourself afterward is no less necessary than the
   devout preparation before, for a careful afterwatch is the best
   preparation for obtaining greater grace. If a person lets his mind
   wander to external comforts, he becomes quite indisposed.

   Beware of much talking. Remain in seclusion and enjoy your God, for you
   have Him Whom all the world cannot take from you.

   I am He to Whom you should give yourself entirely, that from now on you
   may live, not in yourself, but in Me, with all cares cast away.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Thirteenth Chapter

  With All Her Heart the Devout Soul Should Desire Union with Christ in the
  Sacrament


    The Disciple

   LET it be granted me to find You alone, O Christ, to open to You my
   whole heart, to enjoy You as my soul desires, to be disturbed by no
   one, to be moved and troubled by no creature, that You may speak to me
   and I to You alone, as a lover speaks to his loved one, and friend
   converses with friend.

   I pray for this, I desire this, that I may be completely united to You
   and may withdraw my heart from all created things, learning to relish
   the celestial and the eternal through Holy Communion and the frequent
   celebration of Mass.

   Ah Lord God, when shall I be completely united to You and absorbed by
   You, with self utterly forgotten? You in me and I in You? Grant that we
   may remain so together. You in truth are my Beloved, chosen from
   thousands, in Whom my soul is happy to dwell all the days of her life.
   You are in truth my pledge of peace, in Whom is the greatest peace and
   true rest, without Whom there is toil and sorrow and infinite misery.

   You truly are the hidden God. Your counsel is not with the wicked, and
   Your conversation is rather with the humble and the simple.

   O how kind is Your spirit, Lord, Who in order to show Your sweetness
   toward Your children, deign to feed them with the sweetest of bread,
   bread come down from heaven! Surely there is no other people so
   fortunate as to have their god near them, as You, our God, are present
   everywhere to the faithful, to whom You give Yourself to be eaten and
   enjoyed for their daily solace and the raising of their hearts to
   heaven.

   Indeed, what other nation is so renowned as the Christian peoples? What
   creature under heaven is so favored as the devout soul to whom God
   comes, to feed her with His glorious Flesh? O unspeakable grace! O
   wonderful condescension! O love beyond measure, singularly bestowed
   upon man!

   What return shall I make to the Lord for this love, this grace so
   boundless? There is nothing I can give more pleasing than to offer my
   heart completely to my God, uniting it closely with His. Then shall all
   my inner self be glad when my soul is perfectly united with God. Then
   will He say to me: "If you will be with Me, I will be with you." And I
   will answer Him: "Deign, O Lord, to remain with me. I will gladly be
   with You. This is my one desire, that my heart may be united with You."


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fourteenth Chapter

  The Ardent Longing of Devout Men for the Body of Christ


    The Disciple

   HOW great is the abundance of Your kindness, O Lord, which You have
   hidden from those who fear You!

   When I think how some devout persons come to Your Sacrament with the
   greatest devotion and love, I am frequently ashamed and confused that I
   approach Your altar and the table of Holy Communion so coldly and
   indifferently; that I remain so dry and devoid of heartfelt affection;
   that I am not completely inflamed in Your presence, O my God, nor so
   strongly drawn and attracted as many devout persons who, in their great
   desire for Communion and intense heart love, could not restrain their
   tears but longed from the depths of their souls and bodies to embrace
   You, the Fountain of Life. These were able to appease and allay their
   hunger in no other way than by receiving Your Body with all joy and
   spiritual eagerness. The faith of these men was true and
   ardent--convincing proof of Your sacred presence. They whose hearts
   burn so ardently within them when Jesus lives with them truly know
   their Lord in the breaking of bread.

   Such affection and devotion, such mighty love and zeal are often far
   beyond me. Be merciful to me, O sweet, good, kind Jesus, and grant me,
   Your poor suppliant, sometimes at least to feel in Holy Communion a
   little of the tenderness of Your love, that my faith may grow stronger,
   that my hope in Your goodness may increase, and that charity, once
   perfectly kindled within me by tasting heavenly manna, may never fail.

   Your mercy can give me the grace I long for and can visit me most
   graciously with fervor of soul according to Your good pleasure. For
   although I am not now inflamed with as great desire as those who are
   singularly devoted to You, yet by Your grace I long for this same great
   flame, praying and seeking a place among all such ardent lovers that I
   may be numbered among their holy company.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Fifteenth Chapter

  The Grace of Devotion is Acquired Through Humility and Self-Denial


    The Voice of Christ

   YOU must seek earnestly the grace of devotion, ask for it fervently,
   await it patiently and hopefully, receive it gratefully, guard it
   humbly, cooperate with it carefully and leave to God, when it comes,
   the length and manner of the heavenly visitation.

   When you feel little or no inward devotion, you should especially
   humiliate yourself, but do not become too dejected or unreasonably sad.
   In one short moment God often gives what He has long denied. At times
   He grants at the end what He has denied from the beginning of prayer.
   If grace were always given at once, or were present at our beck and
   call, it would not be well taken by weak humankind. Therefore, with
   good hope and humble patience await the grace of devotion.

   When it is not given, or for some unknown reason is taken away, blame
   yourself and your sins. Sometimes it is a small matter that hinders
   grace and hides it, if, indeed, that which prevents so great a good may
   be called little rather than great. But if you remove this hindrance,
   be it great or small, and if you conquer it perfectly, you shall have
   what you ask. As soon as you have given yourself to God with all your
   heart and seek neither this nor that for your own pleasure and purpose,
   but place yourself completely in His charge, you shall find yourself at
   peace, united with Him, because nothing will be so sweet, nothing will
   please you so much as the good pleasure of His will.

   Anyone, therefore, who shall with simplicity of heart direct his
   intention to God and free himself from all inordinate love or dislike
   for any creature will be most fit to receive grace and will be worthy
   of the gift of devotion. For where the Lord finds the vessel empty He
   pours down His blessing.

   So also the more perfectly a man renounces things of this world, and
   the more completely he dies to himself through contempt of self, the
   more quickly this great grace comes to him, the more plentifully it
   enters in, and the higher it uplifts the free heart.

   Then shall he see and abound, then shall his heart marvel and be
   enlarged within him, because the Hand of the Lord is with him and in
   the hollow of that Hand he has placed himself forever. Thus shall the
   man be blessed who seeks God with all his heart and has not regarded
   his soul in vain. Such a one, receiving the Holy Eucharist, merits the
   grace of divine union because he looks not on his own thoughts, nor to
   his own comfort, but above all devotion and consolation to the glory
   and honor of God.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Sixteenth Chapter

  We Should Show Our Needs to Christ and Ask His Grace


    The Disciple

   O MOST kind, most loving Lord, Whom I now desire to receive with
   devotion, You know the weakness and the necessity which I suffer, in
   what great evils and vices I am involved, how often I am depressed,
   tempted, defiled, and troubled.

   To You I come for help, to You I pray for comfort and relief. I speak
   to Him Who knows all things, to Whom my whole inner life is manifest,
   and Who alone can perfectly comfort and help me.

   You know what good things I am most in need of and how poor I am in
   virtue. Behold I stand before You, poor and naked, asking Your grace
   and imploring Your mercy.

   Feed Your hungry beggar. Inflame my coldness with the fire of Your
   love. Enlighten my blindness with the brightness of Your presence. Turn
   all earthly things to bitterness for me, all grievance and adversity to
   patience, all lowly creation to contempt and oblivion. Raise my heart
   to You in heaven and suffer me not to wander on earth. From this moment
   to all eternity do You alone grow sweet to me, for You alone are my
   food and drink, my love and my joy, my sweetness and my total good.

   Let Your presence wholly inflame me, consume and transform me into
   Yourself, that I may become one spirit with You by the grace of inward
   union and by the melting power of Your ardent love.

   Suffer me not to go from You fasting and thirsty, but deal with me
   mercifully as You have so often and so wonderfully dealt with Your
   saints.

   What wonder if I were completely inflamed by You to die to myself,
   since You are the fire ever burning and never dying, a love purifying
   the heart and enlightening the understanding.


     __________________________________________________________________

    The Seventeenth Chapter

  The Burning Love and Strong Desire to Receive Christ


    The Disciple

   WITH greatest devotion and ardent love, with all affection and fervor
   of heart I wish to receive You, O Lord, as many saints and devout
   persons, most pleasing to You in their holiness of life and most
   fervent in devotion, desired You in Holy Communion.

   O my God, everlasting love, my final good, my happiness unending, I
   long to receive You with as strong a desire and as worthy a reverence
   as any of the saints ever had or could have felt, and though I am not
   worthy to have all these sentiments of devotion, still I offer You the
   full affection of my heart as if I alone had all those most pleasing
   and ardent desires.

   Yet, whatever a God-fearing mind can conceive and desire, I offer in
   its entirety to You with the greatest reverence and inward affection. I
   wish to keep nothing for self but to offer to You, willingly and most
   freely, myself and all that is mine.

   O Lord God, my Creator and my Redeemer, I long to receive You this day
   with such reverence, praise, and honor, with such gratitude, worthiness
   and love, with such faith, hope, and purity as that with which Your
   most holy Mother, the glorious Virgin Mary, longed for and received You
   when she humbly and devoutly answered the angel who announced to her
   the mystery of the Incarnation: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it
   done to me according to thy word." [54]

   Likewise as Your blessed precursor, the most excellent of saints, John
   the Baptist, gladdened by Your presence, exulted in the Holy Ghost
   while yet enclosed in the womb of his mother, and afterward seeing
   Jesus walking among men, humbled himself and with devout love declared:
   "The friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
   with joy because of the bridegroom's voice," [55] even so I long to be
   inflamed with great and holy desires and to give myself to You with all
   my heart.

   Therefore I offer and present to You the gladness of all devout hearts,
   their ardent affection, their mental raptures, their supernatural
   illuminations and heavenly visions together with all the virtues and
   praises which have been or shall be celebrated by all creatures in
   heaven and on earth, for myself and all commended to my prayers, that
   You may be worthily praised and glorified forever.

   Accept, O Lord my God, my promises and desires of giving You infinite
   praise and boundless benediction, which in the vastness of Your
   ineffable greatness are justly due You. This I render and desire to
   render every day and every moment of time, and in my loving prayers I
   invite and entreat all celestial spirits and all the faithful to join
   me in giving You praise and thanks.

   Let all people, races, and tongues praise You and with the greatest joy
   and most ardent devotion magnify Your sweet and holy name. And let all
   who reverently and devoutly celebrate this most great Sacrament and
   receive it in the fullness of faith, find kindness and mercy in You and
   humbly pray for me, a sinner. And when they have received the
   longed-for devotion and blissful union, and, well consoled and
   wonderfully refreshed, have retired from Your holy, Your celestial
   table, may they deign to remember my poor soul.

    The Eighteenth Chapter

  Man Should Not Scrutinize This Sacrament in Curiosity, But Humbly Imitate
  Christ and Submit Reason to Holy Faith


    The Voice of Christ

   BEWARE of curious and vain examination of this most profound Sacrament,
   if you do not wish to be plunged into the depths of doubt. He who
   scrutinizes its majesty too closely will be overwhelmed by its glory.

   God can do more than man can understand. A pious and humble search for
   truth He will allow, a search that is ever ready to learn and that
   seeks to walk in the reasonable doctrine of the fathers.

   Blest is the simplicity that leaves the difficult way of dispute and
   goes forward on the level, firm path of God's commandments. Many have
   lost devotion because they wished to search into things beyond them.

   Faith is required of you, and a sincere life, not a lofty intellect nor
   a delving into the mysteries of God. If you neither know nor understand
   things beneath you, how can you comprehend what is above you? Submit
   yourself to God and humble reason to faith, and the light of
   understanding will be given you so far as it is good and necessary for
   you. Some are gravely tempted concerning faith and the Sacrament but
   this disturbance is not laid to them but to the enemy.

   Be not disturbed, dispute not in your mind, answer not the doubts sent
   by the devil, but believe the words of God, believe His saints and
   prophets and the evil enemy will flee from you. It is often very
   profitable for the servant of God to suffer such things. For Satan does
   not tempt unbelievers and sinners whom he already holds securely, but
   in many ways he does tempt and trouble the faithful servant.

   Go forward, then, with sincere and unflinching faith, and with humble
   reverence approach this Sacrament. Whatever you cannot understand
   commit to the security of the all-powerful God, Who does not deceive
   you. The man, however, who trusts in himself is deceived. God walks
   with sincere men, reveals Himself to humble men, enlightens the
   understanding of pure minds, and hides His grace from the curious and
   the proud.

   Human reason is weak and can be deceived. True faith, however, cannot
   be deceived. All reason and natural science ought to come after faith,
   not go before it, nor oppose it. For in this most holy and supremely
   excellent Sacrament, faith and love take precedence and work in a
   hidden manner.

   God, eternal, incomprehensible, and infinitely powerful, does great and
   inscrutable things in heaven and on earth, and there is no searching
   into His marvelous works. If all the works of God were such that human
   reason could easily grasp them, they would not be called wonderful or
   beyond the power of words to tell.
